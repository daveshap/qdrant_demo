AHMED BENTLEY: "So, have you guys given any thought to what you're going to do after graduation?" Ahmed asks, looking at Jane and Sasha. "I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet, but I'm thinking about moving out of the city." JANE SMITH: "I've been thinking about moving out of the city, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for that kind of change," Jane replies, shrugging. SASHA POSKOVA: "I've been thinking about moving out of the city, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for that kind of change," Sasha says, absently stirring her coffee.
