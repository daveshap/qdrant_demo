GIRL: C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
BOY: I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
GIRL: OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
BOY: Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
GIRL: With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
