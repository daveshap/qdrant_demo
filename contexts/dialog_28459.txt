MACREADY: Tie up Clark, too.
PALMER: He's dead.
MACREADY: Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
CHILDS: We should have jumped his ass.
MACREADY: Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
MACREADY: We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
NAULS: What are you going to do? Drink it?
MACREADY: Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole. Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself. When a man bleeds it's just tissue. But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life. When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
