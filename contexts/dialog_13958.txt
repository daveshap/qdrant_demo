MARYLIN: Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
DOYLE: I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
MILES: Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
DOYLE: After you, Doll.
MILES: And how is Mrs. Reiser?
DOYLE: Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a nurse
MILES: So she's uh, flourishing?
DOYLE: She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
DOYLE: Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
MARYLIN: Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
MILES: Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
DOYLE: Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
MARYLIN: Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
DOYLE: Here. Got pictures.
MILES: I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
DOYLE: Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
MARYLIN: Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
DOYLE: ...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
MARYLIN: -- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
MILES: No!
DOYLE: I had no idea until after, but --
DOYLE: Baby. You are so HOT!
MARYLIN: Howard!
MILES: What a touching story.
DOYLE: You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but... I like my women with two boobs.
