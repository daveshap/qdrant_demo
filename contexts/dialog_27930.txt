BRUNTON: My son—in—law. What do you think of him?
CLO-CLO: That depends. How much money has he?
BRUNTON: When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
CLO-CLO: I can't understand that fancy talk. You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
BRUNTON: Why not -- if you like it —- if that's what you really want.
CLO-CLO: Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
BRUNTON: Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
CLO-CLO: Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
BRUNTON: Good looking?
CLO-CLO: Mmm———yes.
BRUNTON: Nice fellow?
BRUNTON: Is he in love with you?
CLO-CLO: I don't know —-
CLO-CLO: Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!
BRUNTON: Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
