BRUCE: Her name is Pamela Isley. I saw her talking to Gordon. She must have stolen his keys, altered the signal-
DICK: And she did it all for me. For love.
BRUCE: She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
DICK: Is that it, Bruce? I'm under some magic spell?
BRUCE: She wants to kill you.
DICK: You'd say anything to keep me away from her. To keep her for yourself.
BRUCE: You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner. That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win. DO you remember?
