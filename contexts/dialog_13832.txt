DON HEWITT: What the hell are you doing?
LOWELL: What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
DON HEWITT: No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
LOWELL: No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
DON HEWITT: Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
