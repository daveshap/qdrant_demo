TED: Jesus Christ. Did you have to be so rough on her?
SHAUNESSY: Do you want the kid or don't you?
GRESSEN: Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
O'CONNOR: Eight, almost nine years.
GRESSEN: And did you have a close personal relationship?
O'CONNOR: Yes...
GRESSEN: And how did you find his work?
O'CONNOR: It was good. He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
GRESSEN: And yet you fired him.
O'CONNOR: Ted was a good worker. But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that. I've got problems, everybody's got problems. But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way... I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
GRESSEN: Thank you. I have no further questions.
