NES galactic empire management game I tried asking this question on Arqade, but it got closed as off-topic since I don't have an image to work with.I remember having a game on the NES back in the early 90s where you were managing a galactic empire. You were in space, but could manage resources from different planets, and could trade between them. You would never land on the planets but could check out what resources were available on each planet in the solar system you were in.Any ideas? I want to say that the cover art on the cartridge had a big purple-ish alien on it.
