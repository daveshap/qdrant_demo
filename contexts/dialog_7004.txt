JENNIFER: This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love.""
FRIDA: Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
JENNIFER: The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark."
FRIDA: Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
JENNIFER: She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
FRIDA: Guess she never found true love.
JENNIFER: The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
FRIDA: So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
JENNIFER: What choice do we have?
FRIDA: So what do I do?
JENNIFER: Fall in love.
FRIDA: I think I already have.
PETER: Your breasts feel larger.
FRIDA: They do? Oh no...
PETER: No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
FRIDA: I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
PETER: No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
