I just got ditched at a bar yesterday
I thought things were going well. We went to the park and walked around for a couple hours and had some drinks that she brought. Then we decided to walk to a bar and we talked about a lot of things on our way there. Then when we got there she said she had to go to the bathroom and never came back. She sent me a text saying she didn’t feel the chemistry. The worst part is, this isn’t the first time this has happened to me. It’s really disheartening.
