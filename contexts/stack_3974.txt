Which estimation technique minimizes the MAPE? Suppose we have two estimation techniques:Linear Least Squares, which aims to minimize squared residualsLeast Absolute Deviation, which aims to minimize absolute residualsWe have a model, which purpose is prediction. More specifically, we want the model to perform good based on the prediction evaluation measure: Mean Absolute Prediction Error (MAPE). Assuming we have no information of the data, can we say something about which estimation technique will likely perform better?
