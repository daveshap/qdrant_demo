KIRK: Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
UHURA: Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
KIRK: Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.
UHURA: Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
KIRK: Transporter room. Status.
SCOTTY: Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
KIRK: Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
SPOCK: Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
KIRK: Damn. Let's go.
SPOCK: Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
KIRK: That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
SPOCK: To land any closer would risk detection.
KIRK: Mr. Sulu. Execute.
