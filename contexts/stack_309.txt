I was looking at an app from the US app store, now I can't find out how to change store back to UK? When trying to update apps I had previously installed I get the message \"Account not in this store\saying I must leave the US store. My region is UK and I have Apple iD and valid payment for UK. How do I change back to the UK store? I even tried creating a new Apple iD and still have the same issue.
