SALLY: I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
SIDNEY: Help me with two minutes of silence!
SIDNEY: Go home, Sally. It's late...
SALLY: I hate to see you like this --
SIDNEY: Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books. And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
SALLY: Sidney, I know you by now. Don't do a dance with me...
SIDNEY: You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
SALLY: Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
SIDNEY: So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
SALLY: Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
SIDNEY: You ought to be used to me by now.
SALLY: I'm used to you...
SIDNEY: No. You think I'm a hero. I'm no hero. I'm nice to people where it pays me to be. I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office. I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so -- Every dog has his day! Lock up and leave the key.
SIDNEY: If that's for me, tear it up!
SALLY: Take a top coat.
SIDNEY: And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
