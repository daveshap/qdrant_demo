While Studying for your grad degree, what type of job did you hold down and what was your living situation like?
Hello, I’m finishing up my first year of graduate school this coming May. I’m in an odd position.

I’m 26 years old and live at home, but wish to move out whilst in my second year in my program. I live in NY.

However, if I take up my degree’s concentration I’ll need to take an internship which will ask me to leave my hypothetical full time job during summer of next year. Ofc if I’m living on my own that would throw everything off.

What did you do for work in grad school, what was your living situation like?
