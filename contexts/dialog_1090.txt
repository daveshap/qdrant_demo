WOODWARD: This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
BERNSTEIN: I never scared anyone before.
WOODWARD: It's not us, they were scared before we got there. What do we know?
BERNSTEIN: Facts or theory?
WOODWARD: Anything you've got.
BERNSTEIN: We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
WOODWARD: And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
BERNSTEIN: I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
