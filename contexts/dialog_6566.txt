CATHERINE: He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
JAMES: It does.
CATHERINE: Do you find him attractive?
JAMES: He's very pale. Covered with scars.
CATHERINE: Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
JAMES: No. But when he's in that car...
CATHERINE: Have you seen his penis?
JAMES: I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
CATHERINE: Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
