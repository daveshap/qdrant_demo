Might fail a drugtest for a new job, need advice. (Post interview, pre acceptance)
[MARIJUANA].  I’m going to be offered a job that I am overqualified for, after nailing 2 interviews back to back. I received an email today from the recruiter saying they would love to offer me the position. (The drug test is after my acceptance of the position) I live in MA, it is recreationally legal as well as medically legal. I have been a heavy smoker now for years and it is deep in my body. At the interview process I was made aware that the company does drugtest and since then I have stopped smoking, (this was about 2 weeks ago). I am nearly certain that I am going to show positive for THC on this drug test. The recruiter did tell
Me that the company DOES ACCEPT medical marijuana cards. I DO NOT have one yet but I am 100% able and willing to go apply and receive my medical card. Should I tell the recruiter about my dilemma (that I was a smoker before hand but stopped but it will still show in my system) before the test. or should I wait until after the test to say anything and and either hope it’s okay or hope I pass. 

I will have the offer conversation with the recruiter tomorrow

Thankyou
