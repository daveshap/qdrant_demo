SMD component list for capacitor Being newbie to electronics, I'm unsure which SMD component to choose. I'm trying to build a step down voltage circuit using AMS 1117 (5 v to 3.3 v).I want to know the SMD capacitor component (bypass caps) that I need to put across voltage regulator (AMS 1117). I know my voltage regulator's component ID : REG1117-3.3.I think 10uF and 100uF would suffice across AMS 1117 voltage regulator. Can someone please suggest which to use? EDIT 1: I want to power an ESP 12E using this.
