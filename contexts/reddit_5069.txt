Can I reach out about a rejection email?
I received a rejection email from a company today that was just from their careers system. This email didn't come from my main contact at the company. Everything for this position was going very smoothly until the coronavirus happened. The last time I reached out to my main contact was March 19. She told me that the position had been put on hold until after Covid-19. 

I feel like I would have been great in that position. I am just a lost right now. 

Please and thank you on any advice.
