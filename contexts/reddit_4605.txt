How Can I stop being so insecure and self depricating?
So I was taught from a young age being too forward and confident was a way to make people not like you, that everyone prefers you to be self depricating. I am super insecure in my friendships and relationships, not about the other person, but about me.

I have autism, its incredibly hard for me to read specific emotions, and also "read the room" as it were, which has lead to some serious issues with human interaction in the past. I overshare, overanalyze and overthink EVERYTHING. And it leads to me constantly feeling like I'm not worthy of any relationship, not worthy to feel emotions that I do feel, and CONSTANTLY question if what I'm feeling is fair, or even my own damn fault.

I'm deeply in love with my partner, he's everything to me, but I can't identify anything he does that annoys, or frustrates me. He has told me in the past things I do that frustrate and annoy him. He has said certain things that made these feelings of inadequacy worse. He didnt mean to hurt me, he deserves to be honest about these things, and I have been doing my best to work on them and better myself. 


But ALL OF THIS, together, has made me a depressed, anxious and nervous wreck. I want to be healthy for him. I want to work on myself and be my best. But I also want that for me. I want to be independant and secure in knowing that even though I do have things to work on, I'm still...worth it. Worth his trouble, worth his patience, worth his love. Im so tired of feeling worthless.

TL;DR
Struggling with my old habits in a new relationship, want to feel more secure in myself on my own, without outside validation. Want to know when and when it isnt appropriate to mention needs being met, or not being met.
