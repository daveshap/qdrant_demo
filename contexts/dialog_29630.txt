ROGER: ...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
EDDIE: With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
ROGER: I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
EDDIE: We're taking the other case.
ROGER: What other case?
EDDIE: Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
EDDIE: Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
ROGER: You really think that's what happened?
EDDIE: I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement.
