JENNIFER: I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
PARRISH: Sure.
JENNIFER: Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
PARRISH: No. Nothing.
JENNIFER: Nothing?
YOUNG MAN: ...It's kind of a pro bono job.
SUSAN: 'Pro bono'. That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
YOUNG MAN: I know what you're saying. Doesn't pay very well. Depends on the woman I marry. Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
SUSAN: You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
YOUNG MAN: I would.
SUSAN: You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
YOUNG MAN: You never know. Lightning could strike.
SUSAN: I've got to go --
YOUNG MAN: Did I say something wrong?
SUSAN: No, it was so right it scares me.
YOUNG MAN: I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor. Because I don't want you to examine me.
SUSAN: Why?
YOUNG MAN: Because I like you so much. You have coffee here every morning, don't you? If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
SUSAN: Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor. ...And I don't want to examine you.
YOUNG MAN: Why not?
SUSAN: Because I like you so much. Now I've got to go.
