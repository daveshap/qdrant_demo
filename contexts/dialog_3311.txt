LOUISE: ... Evening, Chance.
CHANCE: ... Good evening, Louise.
LOUISE: ... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
CHANCE: I see.
LOUISE: I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
LOUISE: ... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
CHANCE: Is his back feeling better?
