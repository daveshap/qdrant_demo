Why does every inconvenience trigger suicidal thoughts?
Yesterday, it was a bad Surf session triggered by comparing my performance with others. Today, it was because the waves were too big for me to ride. I told myself I was lucky to even have the time and opportunity to surf. It eventually gets better with conscious effort to change my perspective, but then some other small inconvenience comes up and restarts the cycle. I want a technique to make it not start in the first place. I don't want to die right now, but I can't stop thinking how comfortable it would be to give up. I hate myself when I feel sorry for myself, which results in this crazy internal struggle, which overwhelms me and makes me want to give up. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks!
