Is there any historical evidence or model of increased law enforcement and stiffer criminalization of drug offenses, reducing drug usage in a community or country?
Many countries have moved to lessen or eliminate criminal drug offenses and move law enforcement funding to treatment programs.

E.G. [Portugal drug policy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_Portugal) 

It appears the US on a state level is moving in this direction with California as an example in the last two years reducing sentences etc.

E.g. [California SB 966, from 2016](http://www.laweekly.com/news/law-would-reduce-jail-time-for-drugs-7000338) 

 There also appears to be a stark contrast wth the current federal enforcement administration, with calls for stronger and tougher enforcement.

E.g. [Jeff Sessions call for stiffer enforcement ](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/us/politics/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-drug-offenses-penalties.html) 

 My question is do both policies work? What evidence supports stiffer enforcement?

Example from today's call for stiffer laws:
