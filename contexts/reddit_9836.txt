New member looking to return to Student Affairs after three year break. Looking for a mentor.
First off, hello everyone!

I was recently seeking resume help and advice when a kind poster pointed me in the direction of this subreddit!  I'm glad to see Student Affairs has such a strong showing here!

As for me, I'm hoping to return to the Student Affairs field after taking a three-year break to work in the private sector.  As much as I'm sure I needed a break after living and working on campus for the better part of 10 years, I find myself missing interacting with students.

I have tried unsuccessfully to re-enter the field but I'm not giving up yet!

I'm looking to connect with people in the field and even find mentors that can help me improve myself, my skill-set, and my ability to serve students.

Thank you so much for reading!
