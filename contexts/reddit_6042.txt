Is this a bad time to take a new job offer?
A few days ago, I was contacted by a recruiter for a position that I had applied for a year ago. I'm struggling with deciding how seriously I should consider changing jobs with all of the economy and virus stuff going on. 

I (accidentally but successfully) negotiated the wage for the position up to $16 per hour on the initial call. I currently make $12.95 with a 10% shift differential most of the time for about $14.20 an hour on average. The pros beyond pay are that the new job would be very similar to my current one, but less stress with a more relaxed atmosphere. The new job would also be day hours instead of my current graveyard shift. Plus, my current job has no possibility of wage or position growth for me, unlike the new job. 

On the con side, the new job would be about 15 minutes further away than my current job. I have a reliable, efficient car though. Also, the new job may have slightly less job security in the face of coronavirus as I'm currently working on a federal subcontract. The big con is that in my industry, a term contract with possibility of hire at the end is standard, so the offer is 5 months with "strong possibility of hire". Usually that wouldn't bother me at all as I've been hired this way several times, but again we're in some weird times.

So, would you consider this job right now? If not, how can I handle this so that they consider me in the future if I apply later?
