BROCK: Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
LIZZY: Don't you mean work me?
BROCK: Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
LIZZY: I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
BROCK: Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory. You see this? Right here?
LIZZY: What?
BROCK: That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
LIZZY: Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
LOVETT: Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
LIZZY: What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
LOVETT: Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
LIZZY: You think she was really there?
LOVETT: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
