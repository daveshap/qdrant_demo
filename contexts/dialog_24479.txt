HOOKS: My apologies. Do you regret not telling the truth?
KABUO: I have told the truth.
HOOKS: You mean, this morning. The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth? That's a question, sir.
HOOKS: I see. Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found? Before your arrest.
KABUO: I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news. We talked for a few hours. I left at six and went straight to my boat.
HOOKS: Didn't go anywhere else? No errands, no purchases? Just straight to the boat. That's the truth.
KABUO: Yes.
HOOKS: Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well. If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
KABUO: I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
