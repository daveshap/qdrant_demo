changing up the look of this subreddit a lot
hey everyone, so i'm pretty much redesigning this whole subreddit starting in around 20 minutes. I don't know how long i'll be working on it, but it could be for a few hours, so just letting you guys know if you visit this subreddit  during that time, it may look weird and uncomplete. It will look much better when the redesign is done, and if you guys have any suggestions for the look of this subreddit, just comment and i'll take it into consideration. thanks everyone for your understanding!
