Voltages in electronics I'm wondering how exactly voltages are transfer between wires. I mean, once I've a voltage lets say 5v and I pulls from it a \"wire\" (not resistor) then at the end of the \"dangling\" wire itself the voltage is 5V and I know why! but I ask how exactly 5v transfer to the wire to be the voltage at the end of the wire 5v?! is it taking time while transfer from voltage source to the end of the wire?!for example lets say I have voltage source(5v) and I pulls from it a dangling wire, so at the dangling wire the voltage is 5v, is it take time from the voltage source 5v to be transferred to the dangling wire to be 5v?! I mean once we connected dangling wire to the source of 5v, is it taking time from the the time that I connected \"dangling wire\" to voltage source(5v) to be 5v at the wire?thanks in advance.
