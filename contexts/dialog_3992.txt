DEBRA: It'll pass.
MARTY: We don't seem to be communicating--
DEBRA: You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
MARTY: I own the place.
DEBRA: Christ, I'm getting bored.
MARTY: I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
MARTY: What's this?
MEURICE: What.
MARTY: This.
MEURICE: Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it.
MARTY: That's not the point.
MEURICE: What's the point?
MARTY: The point is we don't serve niggers here.
MEURICE: Where? ...I'm very careful about that.
