ROXANNE: May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
WILLARD: We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
GASTON: Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
WILLARD: Do you know that jungle?
GASTON: When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
WILLARD: What about an American named Kurtz?
