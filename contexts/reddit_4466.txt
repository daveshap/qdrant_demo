What were you like before depression?
I just had this thought... never before this happened a few years ago was I so apathetic. I had loud,bold personality. I still have it but it's numbed down. I have flashes of my old self, when I get out of my head and have energy I still feel it. 

I think I got better recently. A bit at least. Maybe thanks to quarantine. I take vitamins, started to doing some yoga and a bit of dancing, started course online (it's hard to continue it tho), and I feel like at least I'm not down in the dumps lately.

So I just wanted to hear from you... what were you like?
