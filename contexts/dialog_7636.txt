ROSE: I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
DONNIE: Do you get to meet Ed?
ROSE: If I'm lucky. So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
DONNIE: How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
ROSE: It feels wonderful.
