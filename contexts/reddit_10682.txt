I'm a doctor. I'm done.
I've had enough. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm working my ass off but the patients just keep coming and just keep dying. I have a bad depression at baseline and this pandemic is just throwing me over the edge.

Last month I contacted the suicide hotline and they sent the cops to my door and dragged me to the hospital. I was able to convince them to let me go but the ordeal was expensive and humiliating and awful. I'm never doing that again.

I have to stay up all night because I'm scheduled to start the night shift tomorrow. I'm lonely and bored and a little drunk and just want this all to end.
