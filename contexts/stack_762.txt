Installing driver for USB wifi adapter - completely lost I have three separate USB wifi adapters. All work in Windows. One says Linux compatible on the package (I'll call it \"A\"). It even comes with Linux drivers.I used lsusb.I see the two of the adapters, but not the one which specifies linux compatability and came with drivers.I copied the drivers for \"A\" to a folder in my home folder I called wifi. I clicked properties on install.sh and clicked 'allow executing'. I executed it and it seemed to install some drivers, I was asked for my password twice. But still, the USB is not showing up in lsusb.The other two usb adapters (I don't really care which one I use, as long as it works) show up on lsusb. How do I install the drivers?One is an Asus (Broadcom BCM43526)The other just says ID: 2001:331a D-Link Corp. (Its the Death Star looking USB3 usb wifi adapters..Yes, its pretty cool).So, I know you all get asked this many times a day, but I am stuck on this one. I would love to use the one that has the drivers on the dvd. But, I will use any of them.I am using the latest version of Ubuntu Mate. Bionic Beaver 18.04.The motherboard is an Asrock970m Pro3 (crap)CPU: FX-6350, not overclocked. (crap too, but it was sitting around).8 gigs ram. Want to use this rig as a media server/file server.In an semi-related issue, I have an Nvidia GTX760 in here and its not giving me any option to install the proprietary drivers from Nvidia.Thanks again, any help is appreciated.
