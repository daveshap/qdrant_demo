TOM: I wanted to talk to you about that.
BACON: Well, talk.
TOM: Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
EDDY: The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
TOM: We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
SOAP: I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
EDDY: Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
