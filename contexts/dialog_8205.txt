REYNOLDS: 30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
HICKS: He had help.
REYNOLDS: Help from whom? Christ.
DEAN: Hey!
MAN: Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
DEAN: I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
MAN: Seat 74.
DEAN: You're Brill.
BRILL: You knew the deal. No contact.
DEAN: Who was that other guy?
BRILL: One of many people who would live a word with you.
DEAN: Who are they?
BRILL: You've heard of the National Security Agency?
DEAN: What do they have to do with this?
BRILL: That's who they are.
DEAN: The NSA?
BRILL: Yes.
DEAN: You're crazy.
BRILL: Okay.
DEAN: Wait.
BRILL: You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
DEAN: Yeah.
BRILL: I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
DEAN: What <u>is</u> that?
BRILL: It's a SAT-tracker.
DEAN: I don't know what that means.
BRILL: Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
DEAN: I don't know what that means.
BRILL: 230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
DEAN: I don't know what that means.
BRILL: It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
DEAN: Why are they after <u>me</u>?
BRILL: If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
DEAN: Wait. What do I do?
BRILL: Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
DEAN: Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
BRILL: They're spooks.
DEAN: I don't know what that--
BRILL: Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
DEAN: I don't know <u>anything</u>.
BRILL: No shit.
DEAN: What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
BRILL: Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
DEAN: What if--
BRILL: Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
DEAN: What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
BRILL: And you won't. Now move--
DEAN: I'll pay you.
BRILL: They froze your accounts. Get outa my way.
