LibreOffice Writer crashed and I was not able to retreive the changes I made on my paper.
I was in the zone when suddenly the text became italicized. I tried to press the I button to change the text and then it crashed. I have retrieved my paper, but the paragraph I have just written is all gone.

I almost cried. ðŸ˜­ 

Time to get some happy food.
