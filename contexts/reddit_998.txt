Currently at the movies alone for the first time in my life. I’m kind of freaking out with my hands shaking but I’m also a bit proud I’m doing it - going to the movies alone has been something I’d always wanted to do but been too anxious and self-conscious to do
Okay so it’s in a city 2.5 hours away from where I live so it’s a bit of cheating, as what’s put me off doing it before is seeing someone I know lol, and I am doing it to distract myself from not eating today...but I’m still doing it! I’m still super self-conscious about it but I’m not bailing..yet anyway.

I’m pathetic I know lol, but there’s not many other places I can post about it, so here I am haha

Edit: Thanks for all the kind comments! I really enjoyed the movie and I’m glad I went! :)
