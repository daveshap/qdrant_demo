BUCKAROO BANZAI: That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
RAWHIDE: Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
BUCKAROO BANZAI: The deuce you say. That crate!
RAWHIDE: What crate?
BUCKAROO BANZAI: I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
RAWHIDE: Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems? You think they're mixed up in this?
PENNY PRIDDY: How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
RENO: Nigh on ten years. Been through a lotta scrapes together.
PENNY PRIDDY: What'd you do before? Can I ask?
RENO: Government work. Had my own think tank. Got tired of thinking-wanted some action. Seen plenty of it too. So will you if you stick around.
PENNY PRIDDY: Where's Buckaroo? Is he alive?
RENO: Course he's alive. He's Buckaroo Banzai.
