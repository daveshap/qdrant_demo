Need help returning to career services
A little background: I completed a master's in student affairs 7 years ago. During my program I served as a graduate assistant in career services and really enjoyed the experience helping students find their own career paths. After I graduated I took a job in development and have been working in that field ever since. I would like to return to career services but am having difficulty getting my foot in the door. Even though we preach transferable skills, I am finding that nobody will even consider me for a position. Can anyone help me better communicate my skill set from development to a career position? Thanks in advance.
