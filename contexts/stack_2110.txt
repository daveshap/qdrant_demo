Sad and Melancholy yet Beautiful I have been struggling to find a word that I, at one time, had seen in my vocabulary lessons. I am trying to describe something that is \"beautiful or attractive\" yet also possessing \"sadness or melancholy.\" I think this word was most commonly used in the sense of describing a lady's face, where the poignant feature was seen as \"beautifully sad.\" I might say \"the damsel's face showed lines of worry and stress, and her eyes dripped a touch. Her tousled hair and reddened skin made her a 'pathetic and beautiful' mess.\"As much I try searching for this word, \"pathetic\" is the closest I've come to finding it. This word could be a borrowed one and potentially naturalized.
