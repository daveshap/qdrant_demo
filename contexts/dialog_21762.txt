VICKIE: You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
JAKE: You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
JAKE: That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
VICKIE: It feels real good.
JAKE: Just keep your eye on the ball.
VICKIE: Should I hit it?
JAKE: Just give it a nice little tap.
VICKIE: I can't find my ball.
JAKE: Can you see it?
