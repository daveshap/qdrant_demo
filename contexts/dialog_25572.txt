BEN: The Empire must have gotten here first.
HAN: The planet has been totally blown away! It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
BEN: Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move. We haven't much time.
HAN: Well, I've brought you here. What now?
BEN: We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
HAN: Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
BEN: No, not anymore.
HAN: I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here. I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
LUKE: You can't! We've come this far. We must find them...
HAN: Why?
BEN: Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
HAN: Who's going to pay me then?
BEN: I think there are some things we should talk about.
HAN: I'm beginning not to like you.
HAN: How much do you think she's talking about?
BEN: A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
HAN: Anything I want! Now that's interesting.
LUKE: Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
HAN: All right, all right! You've got a ship! But where do we go from here? They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks. The Empire has already beat us out.
