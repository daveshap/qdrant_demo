REGGIE: I could eat a horse.
ADAM: I think that's what you ordered.
REGGIE: Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
ADAM: How was I leading you on?
REGGIE: All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
ADAM: That's right.
REGGIE: Oh!
ADAM: What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
REGGIE: No -- I guess not.
ADAM: It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
REGGIE: What?
ADAM: Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
ADAM: Oh, you should see your face.
REGGIE: What about it?
ADAM: It's lovely.
ADAM: What's the matter?
REGGIE: I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
REGGIE: Adam!
ADAM: It's all right -- look.
REGGIE: You don't look so bad in this light.
ADAM: Why do you think I brought you here?
REGGIE: I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
ADAM: Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
REGGIE: Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
ADAM: How do you think I got here?
REGGIE: Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
ADAM: No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
ADAM: When you come on, you really come on.
REGGIE: Well -- come on.
REGGIE: I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
ADAM: Relax -- you're gaining.
