I asked this girl out, got rejected
And I'm fine with it. She said we can remain friends and I am really happy about it. Really, I knew she would say no, but I knew I needed to get her off my mind and move on; they only way to do that was to hear if she recuperated those feelings back to me. Now though, whenever I try to text her she doesn't respond; whenever I try to talk to her, I can feel how uncomfortable she is. I want things to return to how they were before I started becoming interested in her, but I am afraid that will never happen. I'm suppose to go to prom with her, but I feel as if I fucked everything up and eventually she will just disappear from my life after that. I feel like she doesn't even want to be around me anymore.
