Flirting or friendly?

There’s this girl in one of my classes that sits by me and my friends and I can’t tell if she likes me or not. Whenever I’m talking with my friends, if she over hears a question I asked and they don’t answer in time she will chime in if she knows the answer. That doesn’t make me think she’s flirty tho. In the halls we lock eyes (I can’t tell by accident or on purpose) and even in that class in the beginning of the period she usually faces to talk to us even though her friend is near by (talking distance). Sorry if this was long. First post but this has been going on for a while and I honestly am clueless when it comes to hints.
