Residence Life job searching with a pet, need advice
A little bit of back story, I'm a 2nd year housing grad looking to stay in residence life in a live-on position ideally as a hall director. My current institution allows grads and live in staff to have a pet without needing ESA documentation or anything besides up to date vet records. However, I do not want to stay here and would rather end up in one of my target cities (west Washington, Denver, NYC, some others).

Now that I'm looking for jobs, I want to be sure my dog can come with me for my next move, as that's one of my non negotiables, but I'm a little unsure of how to go about finding out policies about it from every school I apply to or interview with. Also, I'm unsure of what legal aspects are involved if I decide to go the route of getting him certified as an ESA, if that opens any more doors for me or not.

Lastly, I would appreciate any advice you all have of when to communicate this concern to potential employers... During interviews, before interviews, not until the acceptance phase?

Thanks for help in advance, I can provide additional info if you need or anything wasn't clear.
