I built a free mental health app after being stuck in my tiny studio in NYC
After being stuck in my tiny studio for a month due to Covid-19, I started playing around with mental health apps out there. However, I noticed that most of them require at least 10 mins or more for me to consume the audio content and I often run out of patience trying to finish them. I wanted an app that you can use without reserving much of your time.

Happy is free to use and offers;

* Breathing techniques for keeping calm and relaxed
* Shift your mind from stress and anxiety
* Affirmation and positive quotes to shape your day
* Sleeping tips and tricks
* Calm relaxing music to enjoy
* Free unlimited secure private journal
* Online journal community to talk to people like you
* and more!
