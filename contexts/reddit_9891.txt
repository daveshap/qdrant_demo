Questions regarding necessary qualifications for an International Student Advising position
First, I would like to say thank you simply for this community! I have been browsing recently, and the amount of support this subreddit offers is amazing (I suppose it's only natural- being comprised of academic advisers, and all)!

I graduated from Humboldt State University with a Business Management degree, but my final year there I became heavily involved with the International community on campus, along with the International department at HSU. 

Helping create a welcoming and supportive community for the students studying abroad, especially in a more isolated area compared to what most students anticipated when traveling to California, was extremely rewarding. It felt like I found my calling. Though, aside from the year of volunteering with the university, I'm not confident on how to proceed in pursuing a career in the field.

What are good ways to get a foot in the door and garner advising experience? Is a higher degree necessary? Are there free/affordable certification programs available?

Thank you for your time!
