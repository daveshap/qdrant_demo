Are you ok? Leave your user name and I'll check in on you at least once this month and ask you how are you going.
This is an idea I've been sitting on for about 3 months and now I'm willing to do it. 

I see posts about people having no friends and how making friends is hard all the time and I get it, I'm in that boat too. So I want to reach out to the people who would like a complete stranger to check up on them at a completely random time over the next 31 days.

If you leave your username I'll go through, when I'm bored, and send you a private message asking "are you ok?"

You can reply with one word, yes or no, or you can spill your guts to me and I'll do my best to give you good advice or at the very least give you a "Fuck that * insert person* for being such a * insert derogatory name.*"

Ok that is all :) 

Edit: Wow it went from 6 to 56 in an hour, I thought 30 would be a good number but this is also good. Thanks for all your kind words and to be honest I'm getting anxiety from just thinking about sending so many messages to random people but I promise I will get around to everyone by the end of the month. 

Edit 2: As suggested by a couple of people you can absolutely take note of a few users and send them a PM if you'd like. Me included. 

Edit 3: Oh crap, so long inbox, I barely got to know you. I'll just let this die down a bit before I start sending out more RU OK? PM's. But they will come, and when you least expect it, so don't wait on it. I'll be an RU OK? ninja. Striking when you least expect it.
