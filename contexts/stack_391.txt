Using a bridge br0 while using eth0 and eth0:1 My Situation:I have a Server with Ubuntu 16.04 running on it.This Server has 2 IP Adresses.Now I wanted to install a Brige to give a VM (KVM) acces to the Network so i dont have to write endless IP tabels rules for that portforwarding.Is there any way to do?If i enter a bridge and then type \"brctl show\" it won't who up my recelty created br0.
