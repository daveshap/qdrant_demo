Has anyone else ever broken something on their first day of work?
I work full time at a lab but since exotic animals are a passion of mine and I needed a little extra cash I got a second job at my favorite pet store and they hired me almost immediately which was great, except for the fact that on my first day, yesterday, I was carrying a big heavy tank and it slipped and bumped the corner of the table I was placing it under. The bottom of the tank cracked but didn't shatter, and I panicked and just replaced it and hoped it would go unnoticed. They definitely would have noticed this morning since they use that tank every day to put water in for some of the turtles and since cracked tanks don't really hold water too well it probably leaked water everywhere and someone saw and had to clean it up today. I didn't work today, but I go in tomorrow and since we have to initial everything we do they'll definitely know it was me. What should I do about it? Fess up and tell them it happened or, if they confront me about it, say that I didn't notice and apologize then, since I kinda lost my chance to be honest that day.
