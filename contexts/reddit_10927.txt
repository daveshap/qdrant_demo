Is anyone else not able to cry?
A lot of people have told me that I shouldn't bottle up or hide my emotions, because that would only makes things worse, and that I should express what I'm feeling. But the problem is I have nothing to express or bottle up, I don't feel anything. Nothing makes me happy or excited anymore, although I've gotten pretty good at faking it so people around me don't realize just how dead I am inside. I don't feel sad ever either. Things happen that should make me sad or any other emotion but there's nothing there. I feel like I should feel something, but I don't. I'm just so desensitized to it all I just don't care anymore. And I know I should cry, and Ive tried, but I can't. Nothing happens. I'm just there, as dead as ever with no tears or emotions or anything. At night, when I lay awake, im just blank. I just want to feel something again even if its sadness because I can't keep going feeling so empty inside.
