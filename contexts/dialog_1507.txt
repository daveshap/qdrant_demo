SERAFINE: Andy! Holy shit!
ANDY: Serafine...?
SERAFINE: Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
ANDY: Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
SERAFINE: What happened? Did you cut yourself?
ANDY: Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
