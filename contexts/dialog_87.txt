COLUMBUS: Yes, your Eminence. The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.

COLUMBUS: I am, Your Eminence
AROJAZ: Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately... 22,000 leagues or more. Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
