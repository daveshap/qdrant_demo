How do I tell my supervisor that our new hire is incredibly lazy?
I use the term new hire loosely because he’s been working for us for about 3 months now. I was originally hired as part-time, but most recently converted to full-time. New hire was supposed to take over my old part-time schedule and I needed to train him so he can start on his own tomorrow. The thing is that he he always makes an excuse as to why he can’t work. He’s been doing this ever since he was hired. 

Last night I was supposed to train him. He made up some elaborate excuse about how his uncle is in the hospital (it was almost midnight) and that he needed to leave. I think he’s lying because every time he makes an excuse, he says someone in his family is sick or dying. I have a string of texts that shows him completely changing his excuses at one point, 5 minutes apart. 

The only reason why my supervisor hasn’t been able to find out he’s not working is because I’m saving him and covering his shift. Plus he’s not really paying attention to who clocks in and out. 

New hire also wanted me to come in on my day off tonight to help him train because that’s more convenient for him. I told him I can’t come in, he needs to find someone else to help him. 

I’ve been dealing with this person for so long, how can I tell my supervisor what’s going without coming off as a jerk? I honestly can’t handle dealing with him.
