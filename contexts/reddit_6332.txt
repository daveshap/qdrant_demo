Has anyone gone through the Federal Contractor background check process lately?
My husband is in the process of going through the background check to start work for a federal contractor. The process has been an ordeal. He started the paperwork two weeks ago and was warned it is daunting and takes at least 4 weeks. Any screw up to dates, marking the wrong box, faxing to the wrong location, etc can cause the process to stop for up to six months and he would lose out on the job. He second guesses every form he fills out and the company hiring him can't help him because it's federal forms. 

He is the ideal candidate having lived in the same house for 16 years, one employer for the last 7 years, no criminal background, no drugs, etc and it's still complicated. Any tips or experiences to share?
