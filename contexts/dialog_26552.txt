DYLAN: Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
MACKELWAY: I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
DYLAN: I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
DYLAN: Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
MACKELWAY: You're thinking...?
DYLAN: Who knows.
MACKELWAY: This isn't in our database?
DYLAN: I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
EAGLEFOOT: Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims. Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
SALINAS: I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
EAGLEFOOT: We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
SALINAS: I appreciate it, doctor. You know how it is, press screaming for answers, Washington's all over me. Ever handle a serial case?
MACKELWAY: No.
SALINAS: Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
KOESSLER: Chuck, hello. This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
KULOK: Just an observer.
EAGLEFOOT: Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
SALINAS: This is Agent Mackelway.
