MADISON: He was re—enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
PARKER: Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
MADISON: Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
PARKER: Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
MADISON: I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him. Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done. The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
PARKER: I know who would know.
