Out of the field wanting back in. Help?
Hello everyone! I have a bit of an issue right now with where I want my career to go. I graduated May 2015 with my masters in student affairs but have had no luck in finding a job. Since then I have been working in food service/retail to make ends meet but I don't know how to best communicate this in my resume/cover letter. Do I leave off the work I have been doing and tell them in the interview phase? How do I incorporate this last year+ if I do at all?

Any help you could give me would be very very much appreciated.
