DAMONE: And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
THE RAT: I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
DAMONE: You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
STACY: Thanks for coming to get me.
THE RAT: Sure thing.
STACY: This is a nice car.
THE RAT: Yeah. It's my sister's.
STACY: Do you have Mrs. George for English?
THE RAT: Yeah. She is pretty good.
STACY: Yeah. She is pretty good.
THE RAT: Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
STACY: I've heard that, too.
THE RAT: Do you know what you want?
STACY: I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
THE RAT: Excellent.
STACY: Are you all right?
THE RAT: Oh yeah.
THE RAT: Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
STACY: Not at all.
WAITRESS: Are you ready to order here?
THE RAT: Well... sure. She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
WAITRESS: Anything to drink?
THE RAT: Two Cokes.
WAITRESS: Okay. Thanks.
DAMONE: Yo.
THE RAT: Damone. It's Mark.
DAMONE: Mark. What happened to your date?
THE RAT: It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
DAMONE: Did you go home and get it?
THE RAT: No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
THE RAT: Damone, are you there?
DAMONE: I'm really pretty busy...
