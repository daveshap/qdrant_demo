MOHAMMED: You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
HAMMER: Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
MOHAMMED: It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
