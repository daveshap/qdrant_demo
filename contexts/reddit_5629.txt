I have a Master in translation, yet haven't found any customer in almost a year, what am I doing wrong?
I decided to register as a freelance translator about 8 months ago so that I could attend my ill mother and I was confident I was going to find a company that would hire a freelance (EN > FR or vice versa) translator, but boy was I wrong.

At first I wanted to specialize in videogame translation but despite asking half a hundred indie developpers, I wasn't able to find a single one who needed my services. Then I opened up my field of possibilities a little bit more and answered several requests on multiple websites such as Translatorscaf√©, Indeed, Linkedin, Upwork etc but I never got any answer except negative ones, I eventually decided to try and become a teacher at private schools in my city but unfortunately that's when the outbreak happened...

I'm not really worried about the money since my mom lets me stay at home and she earns enough to feed us both, yet I'm 26 and still unemployed and would really like to start my god damn life a bit, but I'm completely lost and can't seem to sort the options I have left.
