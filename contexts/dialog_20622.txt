PEGGY: But I want you and Scott to understand. Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
BETH: Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
PEGGY: Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
BETH: Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
PEGGY: Borrow?! This was my dress. Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say... Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
BETH: Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
PEGGY: Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
PEGGY: I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
BETH: Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
PEGGY: I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
