What are the pros and cons of applying the Magnitsky Act to the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman?
With the recent revelation that the [Saudi government conspired to execute Washington Post and American resident Jamal Khashoggi](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/12/middleeast/khashoggi-saudi-turkey-recordings-intl/index.html?utm_medium=social&utm_source=fbCNN&utm_term=link&utm_content=2018-10-12T10%3A30%3A14), there has been [talk that the Magnitsky Act should be applied to the Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/10/12/what-is-the-global-magnitsky-act-and-why-are-u-s-senators-invoking-this-on-saudi-arabia/?utm_term=.c0d868bbafb5).  This action by Salamn appears to be a continuation of a trend of harsh reprisals against activists and journalists. An example of this would be the [death penalty being recently applied to activists advocating for women's rights](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/middleeast/saudi-arabia-death-penalty-female-activist-intl/index.html). [When Canada raised protests about the treatment of these women activists, Saudia Arabia expelled the Canadian ambassadors, froze all trade with Canada, and issued threats via tweets pertaining to 9/11 style attacks on Canada.](https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/07/saudi-arabia-threatens-canada-9-11-style-plane-attack-shocking-tweet-7806950/)



The counterpoint being raised to the application of the Magnitsky Acts to Salman is that applying sanctions to Saudia Arabia would cause them to pivot away from America and towards either Russia or China. [This point has been used as justification by President Trump for not cancelling $100 billion in arms sales currently scheduled to go to Saudia Arabia.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/12/politics/mnuchin-imf-meeting-saudi-trip/index.html)


What are the implications of applying the Magntisky Act to Prince Salman? Are there other alternatives to rebuke Saudia Arabia without jeopardizing their role as a U.S. ally?
