Update: Trying to get back into Student Affairs after 3 years in the private sector
Thanks to some truly amazing people in this sub, I've been able to fine-tune my resume and begin my job-search in earnest.

While I was initially wanting one of two specific cities, I have since used up all possible agent slots at HigherEdJobs.com and picked 8 major cities with a large number of higher education institutions, fantastic public transportation, and generally seem like fun places to live.  My 10 job agents are Lexington and Louisville, KY to be close to family, New Orleans to stay local, New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle, WA, Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA, and Philadelphia, PA.

I've gone from applying for one job a week to applying for 3 a day.  I'm excited.  I'm fully confident that by the time the next school year starts I will be back in Higher Education where I belong.

Some tips that people shared that I think deserve repeating:

- Some institutions are toxic.  Just because you had a bad experience at one institution does not mean that Student Affairs is not the field for you.  It just means that the institution its self could have been a poor fit.
- Make sure you have a career trajectory in mind.  It is far too easy (especially in this economy) to stagnate in one job and position out of fear of being unemployed.  If there is no upward mobility in a position, it might be time to look elsewhere.
- Career development and mentorship opportunities should be a key factor in selecting potential employment.  Sometimes it is worth making a little less if there is opportunity for long-term growth.

There was so much more advice given, but those aspects really stuck out to me.

Thanks for reading!

**03/17/15 EDIT:** I just got an e-mail asking to set up a phone interview at Fordham University in the Bronx.  It's a small Jesuit Catholic university with ~9,000 students.  According to Glass Door the salary range is between 26-30k a year, and it's a great opportunity and I've never spent time in New York before.  Yay adventure!

Any advice on how to prepare for the interview would be amazing!
