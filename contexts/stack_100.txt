Control + H Deletes text and other weird keyboard shortcuts For some weird reason, when I hold down Control + H it deletes the text as if I was pressing the \"Delete\" button. Occasionally, when I hold down Control + L and have a text highlighted, it would highlight it in yellow as if I clicked hard enough to define it. This just started happening a few days ago. I did not install any apps or programs prior to this happening. I tried this in Chrome, Notes, and other apps to see if it was app specific - it wasn't. It had this problem system wide. I also booted my Mac in safe mode and it still happens in safe mode.Does anyone have any idea as to what's happening?I have a 2015 Macbook Pro running on OS X High Sierra 10.13.3.Thanks!
