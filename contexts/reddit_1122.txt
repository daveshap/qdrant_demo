Finally decided to woman up and visit a psychiatrist today and got told that I had severe anxiety and panic disorder and should've visited sooner. Hopefully will get my life back on track. My mind has exhausted me.
My brother said I deserved it for acting up idk what that even means but it hurt. You gotta take care of yourself cause even your family doesn't always care.
