Rejected With a Full Ride
Having applied ED2 to a top LAC, I kept my expectations low. Decisions came in early February and I was rejected. Can't say that I wasn't disappointed but I moved on fairly quickly. Come 29 February and I receive an email saying there is an "application update", which has to be the most confusing moment for me in this whole process. I go open my portal and see a "financial aid award letter". Clicked on that and... it's a full ride! If I hadn't received the rejection letter, I would have been ecstatic but I felt nothing but confusion. I go back and forth between my rejection letter and financial aid award letter to make sure I wasn't hallucinating, and everything was in order (except being rejected with financial aid). I finally decide to email the school to get some clarification. They replied, apologized for the mistake and said they had mixed up my ID number with someone else's. They pulled the financial aid letter from my portal and kept the rejection letter. I don't know how to feel about this. I would be lying if I said I didn't have a brief moment of hope. Nothing I can do, I guess. Congratulations to whoever earned this full ride!
