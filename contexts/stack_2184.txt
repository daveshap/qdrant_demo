Lava hound attack strategy for farming resources During the Lava Hound event, Hounds are 1/10th of their usual price. I'm drawing a blank on attack strategies for looting (farming) using Hounds. I've tried 3 or 4 Hounds and the rest Balloons. If the defending CC has troops that shoot (which they often do since everyone knows about the event), the Hounds and Balloons are toast. I'm trying to add Wizards and Hogs (to draw out troops) to my army composition, but at this point it doesn't seem like I'm going to use the sale. Any suggestions? Is there a resource where I can find attack strategies for the current troop on sale? I find having these events make the game a lot more fun, but using some troops is trickier than using others.
