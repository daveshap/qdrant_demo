Generate Data where outcome is conditional on independent variables I want to generate a synthetic dataset {Y, X1, X2}. Independent random variables X1 and X2 follow bernouli distribution where probabilities for X1 and X2 are known.Whereas, outcome variable Y needs to follow normal distribution with an expected mean E(Y|X1,X2) = X1 + 3.2X2 and Standard Deviation of 1.4.n = 1000X1 = np.random.binomial(1,.25,n)X2 = np.random.binomial(1,.30,n)Not sure, how to generate Y which is conditional on X1 and X2, normally distributed and follows the formula for each of the observation Please help.
