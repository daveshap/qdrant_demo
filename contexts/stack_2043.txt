What's the word or phrase for how one's body's health or behavior is unique to them? Each person has their own physiological sense of smell or taste, which makes them like some foods and hate others (e.g. my family thinks durians smell like heaven, my chem teacher finds them nauseating). Their body make-up is also unique which makes them susceptible to certain diseases, while immune to others (e.g. some have deadly allergies, while others almost never get sick). What would be the proper term or phrase to refer to that uniqueness? Could it be \"physiological make-up\" or something, like \"genetic/psychological make-up\"?
