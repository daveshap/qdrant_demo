SIMON: Yes.
NORMAN: Yes.
WAYNE: How can you say that you 'admire' them?
NORMAN: It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
WAYNE: Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
NORMAN: They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
WAYNE: And they made the first move?
NORMAN: Unfortunately, yes.
SIMON: But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
WAYNE: Why?
SIMON: They passed the 'edge' along to us.
WAYNE: How so?
SIMON: By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
WAYNE: But you'll never be whole again.
SIMON: Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.
NORMAN: That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
SIMON: That's the way of the world.
NORMAN: They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
SIMON: Survival of the fittest.
