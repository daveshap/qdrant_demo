EXLEY: You're wrong.
DUDLEY: Am I...? Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
EXLEY: Dudley, we've been over this.
DUDLEY: Answer yes or no.
EXLEY: I... No.
DUDLEY: Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...? Yes or no, Edmund.
EXLEY: No.
DUDLEY: Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
EXLEY: No.
DUDLEY: Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
EXLEY: No.
DUDLEY: Then for God's sake, don't be a detective. Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices. Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
EXLEY: I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did. Or my father.
DUDLEY: At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
STENSLAND: Hey, partner. Grab a cup.
BUD: I got to write my report first.
