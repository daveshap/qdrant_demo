ROSE: There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. Isn't that right, sweetie.
LOVETT: Would you like anything?
ROSE: I should like to see my drawing.
LOVETT: Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
ROSE: It was a dreadful, heavy thing. I only wore it this once.
