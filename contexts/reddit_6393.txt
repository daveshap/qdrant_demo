Need to stand out? Wow hiring managers with the "World's Smallest Cover Letter"
Here's a little way to stand out from the rest of the crowd that got me an interview with an NBA team. I used this [site](http://www.leafcutterdesigns.com/shop/wsps/tiny-letters.html) and mailed the hiring manager the "world's smallest cover letter." They are guaranteed to open the package and be intrigued by it.

This is what I wrote in mine:
>Dear HR Manager,
This may be the world’s smallest cover letter, but don’t let the packaging fool you, great things come in small packages. As the --job title-- for the --company--, I will do ---------. I have extensive experience in ---------- and --------- is my forte. My ---------- skills have been vital to my success and are additional strengths that I would bring to the job.  

>A small envelope wouldn’t be complete without a small favor: Give me a call to discuss how I can add value to your organization by being the --job title--

>--your name--

>--phone number--

The hiring manager LOVED it and showed it to 3 other people in the office. I didn't end up getting the job, but I definitely set myself apart from everyone else and got noticed.



btw, I am in no way affiliated with the company, I just love their products and it has helped me so I want to share my success so it can help you too.
