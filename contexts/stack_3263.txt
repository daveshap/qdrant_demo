Was the governing council of Zion also the new Zion seed population? In Matrix Reloaded, Neo asks Councillor Hamann, in a seemingly rather pointless rhetorical jab, why there only old men on the council.Later in the movie, we learn that the purpose of The One is to enter the source and disseminate his Oneness to the rest of the Matrix, while the city of Zion is systematically genocided. Before he goes, he gets to choose some number (20?) seed humans to begin repopulating the next iteration of Zion if the cycle continues.Is the reason that there are no young people on the council that they are the original seeds? Is Councilor Hamann in on it? Does he know about the certainty of the incoming genocide? It might give some color to some of his rationalizing talk about human-machine codependency.
