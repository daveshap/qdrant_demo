I think the one hardest part about not working out is wondering why you weren’t good enough.
This especially happens when you see that she wasn’t into you or she breaks up with you and then short time later she’s with someone else.

You begin to wonder “why?” “Was I not good enough?” “What about him did she like that I wasn’t enough?”

Now of course this does not account for unhealthy relationships like abuse and all that stuff. I’m talking more about when a girl loses feelings for you or was never into you in the first place.
