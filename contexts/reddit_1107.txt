Does anyone else cry when someone is unhappy with you or after being scolded?
I just got a stern talking to from my boss about a mistake I made and I managed to keep it together while talking with him but as soon as I got off of the phone I started crying and wanted to hurt myself. Ive been crying off and on for the last 40 minutes and I need to get over it and move on. I wish I was more resilient. People make mistakes and not everyone is going to be happy with you all of the time, I need to learn how to bounce back and go back to getting work done not sit here and cry uncontrollably for almost an hour. 

Does anyone else struggle with this sort of thing? How do you deal with it?
