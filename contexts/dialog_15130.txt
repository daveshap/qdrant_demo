RUBY: Well?
SENA: He's fucking nuts.
RUBY: Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
SENA: No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality. And he doesn't sleep.
RUBY: Doesnit sleep?
SENA: Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation. Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
RUBY: He wets the bed?
SENA: I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
