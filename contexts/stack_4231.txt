Aliens performing successful medical procedure on humans at first contact? So, humans have finally figured out how to build a solar-system crossing ship. On the way to the first exo-planet to be colonized, an accident happens, and a few people wind up floating through space, injured. Aliens find the person(s) individually let\u2019s call each person X. X is still alive, and there are no problems relating to nutrition via another bit I don\u2019t have time to explain. Would the aliens be able to fix X\u2019s injuries?What if X was a child? Or a woman on her period?for the purposes of this question my aliens are humanoid and carbon-based.X is familiar with the procedure for first contact, and can successfully initiate it.The aliens want to help X.there are no human remains accessible.aliens are humanoid only in that they are bipedal, have two genders, have four limbs, and hair on their heads. They do not however have hair anywhere else, would this lead to confusion?the people are basically loose in spacesuits.
