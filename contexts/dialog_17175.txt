MRS. PILLETTI: He coming home right now.
VIRGINIA: So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
MRS. PILLETTI: She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, Catherine
VIRGINIA: So she say, You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled
MRS. PILLETTI: Well, I don't know what you want me to do, Virginia. If you want me, I'll go talk to her tonight.
THOMAS: Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
VIRGINIA: Lemme tell it, Tommy.
THOMAS: Okay.
VIRGINIA: We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
MRS. PILLETTI: Sure.
VIRGINIA: Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
MRS. PILLETTI: Well...
VIRGINIA: Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, Joe
MRS. PILLETTI: No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
VIRGINIA: I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
THOMAS: All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
MRS. PILLETTI: She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
THOMAS: That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
MRS. PILLETTI: We gotta ask Marty, of course.
THOMAS: Sure.
MRS. PILLETTI: You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking.
VIRGINIA: That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
THOMAS: How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
