How can I see which files I used some days ago? I had a telephone conference days three days ago. I took notes while talking and now I can't find them. It could be that I just tipped them into an open document or maybe I created a new one and didn't save it properly or idk... I looked through the last versions of the last docs I used but found nothing.I still know the exact time I called, so maybe I would remember where I wrote them if I could see which files I used while the call.Is there any possibility to see which files I used that time? I already tried to look it up on the console but found nothing. And in the device tab, there are only the events of today.I'd be very happy if someone could help me because these were very important.Have a nice weekend,Daniel
