THEO: What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
SHEILA: Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
THEO: You're really pissing me off.
SHEILA: I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
THEO: My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
SHEILA: What about plan C?
THEO: Fuck plan C!
SHEILA: Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
THEO: You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
SHEILA: I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
THEO: Sez you!
SHEILA: Suck my dick!
