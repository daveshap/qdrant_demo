Average funding for MSc STEM students in Canada?
I’ve got 2/3 acceptances so far from the schools I’ve applied to, with funding from both of them. 

One is potentially significantly more than the other (I was nominated for a prestigious entrance award worth $10k, but the results won’t come in until later). But in order to make sense of the lower offer, I’m hoping to get some context for how much is “good” when it comes to MSc funding in Canada (especially in STEM)? I’m more on the CS / math / physics side of the acronym, if that makes a difference. 

I‘m not close with anyone who has done an MSc in STEM recently, so I don’t have anyone to talk to about funding with irl. 

Further potentially relevant info: the lower offer is at my first choice school, which is in a higher cost of living city. I’ve also applied for NSERC at all 3 schools, but won’t know about that until April; I think I’m more likely to get NSERC at the school that’s already offered me more (just based on number of awards / students at each school).
