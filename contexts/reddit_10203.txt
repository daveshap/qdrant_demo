I’m sick and tired of nobody giving a fuck about how you feel unless you’re cutting yourself or want to kill yourself.
Does anybody understand how incredibly selfish that is?? “Don’t do it there’s so much to live for” like what your sorry ass who doesn’t want me gone so that you’re not sad? Guess fucking what I don’t fucking care if you’re that selfish you deserve to be just as sad as I am. I’ve been suffering all my life and you don’t give a fuck but the SECOND I say I’m gonna kill myself NOW it matters. But if I shut up about wanting to die and just express about how hurt I am you have better things to do you don’t fucking care nobody fucking cares. “Don’t talk to me about suicide it makes me uncomfortable” oh so sorry need me to paint your nails too princess??

And like cutting doesn’t even give me any sort of nice relief it doesn’t do anything for me. Wanna know why I do it? To express how fucking bad I’m hurting because nobody gives a shit unless you cut yourself. People can be suffering WORSE and not cut themselves because it doesn’t do anything for them. Nobody fucking cares nobody fucking cares nobody fucking cares and I’m so sick and tired of it
