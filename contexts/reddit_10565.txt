Does anyone else on this sub feel like there’s an invisible anchor dragging you down? At this point I’m sick of fighting it and I just want to drown
One minute I’ll be walking down the street. Everything’s fine, I love walking, don’t you know endorphins are supposed to be the body’s natural heroin, and then suddenly I feel myself slowing down.

My footsteps become heavier to the point I’m trudging on the sidewalk and I feel like I’m a thousand pounds.

It gets to the point where my feet are made of lead and I can’t even walk anymore. I can’t even stay still, I just want to lay on the concrete and let people step on me, whatever. 

It’s like there’s this anchor and it’s dragging me down and I just want to slip under because all my life I’ve been falling and I’ve finally gotten to the place where I can’t climb back out. 

Everything requires a monumental effort, except for my suicidal thoughts which pop into my head like spam emails. I just want it to stop. And suicide feels like my only way out.

I just want to feel lighter.
