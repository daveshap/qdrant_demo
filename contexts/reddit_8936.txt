What exactly is the Justice Department policy on releasing investigative material that doesn't lead to criminal charges? Did the release of Clinton FBI interview 302s establish precedent for what the Justice Department will release?
The current Attorney General, William Barr, has said he will [follow Justice Department guidelines](https://www.lawfareblog.com/william-barrs-remarkable-non-commitments-about-mueller-report) in regards to what information should be released to the public from any Mueller report. That citation notes that Barr will have a lot of discretion for deciding what to release depending on what he believes is in the public interest.

The Justice Department has at times released evidence directly relating to an investigation that did not produce any criminal charges.

I have a couple questions:

1: What exactly is the Justice Department policy on releasing investigative evidence when no criminal charges are filed? Is it well codified?

2: House Republicans successfully petitioned the Justice Department for 302 interview summary reports even though no charges were filed in the Clinton email case. Is this now established precedent, and will the Justice Department  have to hand over similar information in regards to the Mueller investigation?
