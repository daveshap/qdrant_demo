SOBOZINSKI: You trust this Moonan guy?
ROTTOVICH: I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
SOBOZINSKI: It's just insurance.
ROTTOVICH: That's what I'm talking about.
SOBOZINSKI: I'm down!
ROTTOVICH: What are you doing?
SOBOZINSKI: High five.
ROTTOVICH: Put your hand down. I don't high five.
MOONAN: You guys awake?
ROTTOVICH: We're here.
