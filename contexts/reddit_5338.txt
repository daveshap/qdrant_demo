My old boss got put on a PIP, then told me and the rest of the team vague details from the PIP meeting—e.g. the words “not meeting expectations” were used. It kickstarted our team, and people really tried to turn it around and my boss got off the PIP. How much info is okay to share in such cases?
Like if your manager has told you you’re not doing as well as they’d like, and you know you’ll need your teammates’ help in order to improve quickly, how much is okay to share?

In my old manager’s case, they were well-liked enough that people rallied to help them. They didn’t share the info in an antagonistic way against upper management, I guess; it was more of “I really need to turn this around or else I’m not gonna have a job here.”
