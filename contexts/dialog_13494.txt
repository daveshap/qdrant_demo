BEN: You've...
ELENA: In the car.
BEN: Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
ELENA: This just isn't the best moment for this.
BEN: I know, I know. I had no idea --
ELENA: That this was going to be a key party?
BEN: Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
ELENA: Well?
BEN: I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
ELENA: Damn it, Ben --
BEN: I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
ELENA: You're not going to --
BEN: I'm not.
ELENA: You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
BEN: Elena.
BEN: Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
ELENA: Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
BEN: Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
ELENA: Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
