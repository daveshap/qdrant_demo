Anyone else here work in social media and hate their jobs?
I started this job last September and I hate it. People don't seem to appreciate the work that I do and I get paid lower than my coworkers. My boss said that I've been there for 8 months and we haven't gone viral yet. I get a lot of complaints and few appreciation.
