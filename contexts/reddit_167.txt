i cant do this anymore

i got a crush on a girl from my class. Yeah we are friends but i can get better at talking more

anyways.. i am thinking of telling her that i love her. (we have been in the same class since August and i have loved her since the first look at her)

But im so afraid of losing her. What is she talks less to me after that? That question actually keeps me up every night so i lose sleep.

if i tell her, i would say it around 30th of January or early February. i dont wanna do it the day before winter break cause i cant deal with all the thoughts while being home.

SO LISTEN FROM HERE PLEASE: (important)

i might be leaving the school in June if i choose to be a hairdresser/barber.

i CAN stay if i choose interior designer.

That job choice will be taken March 1st. and thats when we have winter break. So im really confused what to do.

Thats also the reason i wanna confess before the winter break so if it goes bad i can just choose to leave...

But i wanna become her close friend, what if she gets a boyfriend?

	‚ÅÉ	if she actually says YES, im still not allowed by my parents to go outside after school or come home late... is that ok? But she most likely will say no.
Okay we can stay as friends but she might talk less to me.

When i think about it.. relationships are stress anyways.. i have given her HINTS like giving her christmas gift and stuff

BUT I GOTTA talk more i guess, the question still comes back though, do i ever confess?

She is single... its 1 am i hope you can help
