Do history masters do tests and exams?
I'm sure it varies from program to program, but I've just been assuming grading was mostly in class discussions of readings and research papers and didnt really know for sure. My undergrad history programs rarely had tests or quizzes but it did happen once in a while, just curious if anyone here has encountered them at the graduate level. I start class in the fall and I'm pumped, even if I do end up having to take a test or two ;)
