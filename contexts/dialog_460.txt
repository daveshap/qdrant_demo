LINDSEY: You need me. Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do. What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off? What would have you done?
BUD: Wow, you're right! Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves. Coulda been a disaster.
BUD: You wanna know what I think?
LINDSEY: Not particularly. Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
BUD: I think you were worried about me.
LINDSEY: That must be it.
BUD: No, I think you were. Come on, admit it.
LINDSEY: I was worried about the rig. I've got over four years invested in this project.
BUD: Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
