[meta] Can we have a rule that bans vague clickbaity titles? Far too many "The one thing you should do to get better" and "The one thing that really helped me". I think the sub would benefit from having the tip or topic written in the title
It's much easier to scroll through a list of topics and tips, and reading posts that are applicable to you than having to click on a bunch of clickbaity titles to look for the nuggets. What do you guys think?
