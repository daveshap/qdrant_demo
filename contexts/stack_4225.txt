What would be a seemingly fair, but still unfair way of dividing council seats? IntroductionI'm creating humongous city in a renaissance-esque fantasy setting. This city is governed by a council/senate with 51 seats. Division of these seats is based on ownership of stocks in 5 different merchant guilds in the city. QuestionHow would one design a division algorithm that gives the illusion of a fair allocation of seats/stock, but is ultimately unfair in that it grants more seats to the super-rich and none/very few to the not-so-rich.NotesOne person can hold many seats...but never a majority of them, unless they own ALL stocks.Each merchant guild has exactly 1000 stocks, which means 5000 stocks in total.Only stocks are divided by merchant guild. The seats does not necessarily go to specific guild stocks.One can own stocks from multiple guilds. Anyone can buy stocksOwning a few stocks does not guarantee a seat (obviously)It should be possible to mathematically figure out the system, but complex enough that most people can't do it.This is a ridiculously unfair system as it literally states that you need lots of money to be allowed influence over the government.Seats are not voted on by the stock-holders. You either have enough to get a seat or you don't. Answers from comment questionsSeats can not be empty. All seats are divided among the stock-holders and you cannot decline a seat, when you're given one.
