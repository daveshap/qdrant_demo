BOURNE: It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
IRENA: Yes...
BOURNE: That's not what happened to your parents.
IRENA: Then what?
BOURNE: I killed them.
BOURNE: It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere... I had to change my plan. You understand me? You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
IRENA: You killed them.
BOURNE: They loved you. And I killed them.
IRENA: How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
BOURNE: I don't want you to forgive me.
