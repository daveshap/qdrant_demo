SMECKER: These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
DUFFY: Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
SMECKER: Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
DUFFY: Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
SMECKER: Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid. God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
MURPHY: Hello?
ROCCO: Hey, Murph.
MURPHY: Roc. You okay?
ROCCO: Yeah. Anybody call for me?
MURPHY: No. You sure you're okay?
ROCCO: I'm fuckin' fine. Catch you on the flip side.
ROCCO: Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
CONNOR: What happened?
ROCCO: I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
