Guys who don’t text
I’m going on a 3rd date with a guy who doesn’t text as much as other guys I’ve been on dates with. 

He seems really sweet and a little bit shy (we haven’t kissed) but I do like him.

He texted me after our second date and said he had a good time. He said he’s going away for a week for a vacation and he’ll text me when he gets back to hang out again. He texted me as soon as he got back and asked if I was free to get brunch on Saturday and asked how my thanksgiving was. I said yes, etc. so we will meet up then. 

But he doesn’t initiate other texts about anything else...is that normal? I know he is interested. He has read receipts on his phone and he takes hours to read texts but does reply right away usually.) Maybe he’s just not a big texter or just doesn’t use his phone a ton?

Update: unfortunately, the date didn’t go to well. We had a good conversation but again no kiss or any chemistry. He seems really shy. He didn’t even walk me home even though I live like 5 mins away. He doesn’t seem interested in a romantic relationship.
