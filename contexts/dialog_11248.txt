SWAY: She's trouble --
MEMPHIS: I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
SWAY: I go with you --
MEMPHIS: That what you want?
SWAY: That's what I want ...
MEMPHIS: Okay.
SWAY: You mentioned that in your letters
MEMPHIS: I always thought you'd follow me up.
SWAY: We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
MEMPHIS: Very good...
SWAY: Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
MEMPHIS: No way ...
SWAY: No ... ?
MEMPHIS: No ...
SWAY: Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
MEMPHIS: Oh. Okay. Right.
MEMPHIS: I'm on the move -
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Your girl works in there ...
MEMPHIS: Not my girl anymore
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
MEMPHIS: What do you want from me?
DETECTIVE CASTLEBECK: Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
