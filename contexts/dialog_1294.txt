KEVIN: No comment?! Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
JESSICA: Thanks. It was my idea.
KEVIN: Did you guys hook up or something?
JESSICA: Are you kidding? No.
KEVIN: Then what the hell are you talking about?
JESSICA: Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now. That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. Finch comes to me and says, Jessica
KEVIN: I don't get it, that really works?
JESSICA: Duh. Of course. Naturally, I embellished a little bit. Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
