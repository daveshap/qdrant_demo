Girl insisted that I pay after I asked for 2 bills
First time I post here! I have been dating for years and I felt like sharing my last exeprience!

I went out to a bar with a woman I met on tinder. Things were going great, we both were having a great time, lots of sparks in our eyes, touching each others hands, smiling, conversation was flowing. So after 5 hours of non stop talk, its getting late and we both have to catch the last subway. So I ask the barperson if we can get the bill. I ask for two of them.

At this instant, the woman looks at me and she transformed herself. She ask why was I not offering to pay? I'm surprised and I tell her I simply don't usually pay when I meet someone for the first time, it makes me uncomfortable and puts pressure. She then, proceed, and I kid you not, to say out loud: I would have never taken so many drinks if I knew. You had to tell me, its unfair. 

At that point the bartender sees this happening and come over to make sure everything is okay, and she ask him for 1 bill only (that I would pay). He looks at me and I ask him for two, and he leaves a little confused. 

We then talked a little and I tried to joke around to release the tension, and she told me that if I paid, wed go to my place after. 

I kept on joking around and we ended up paying each other her bill, while she was rambling during the whole time she was paying. We went to the subway,and went our own way!

It was quite the funny experience and I felt like sharing it with you guys!
