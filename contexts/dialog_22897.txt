SARGE: Uh, oh.
MILLER: Out of the mouth of babes.
MILLER: Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping. You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
UPHAM: But, sir...
MILLER: There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
UPHAM: Goddamn it, sir...
MILLER: That's better, but you've still got a long way to go. Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
REIBEN: Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
MILLER: See to it.
RYAN: I'd like to go, sir.
MILLER: No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
