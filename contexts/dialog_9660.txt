PARRY: Happily married, probably.
JACK: Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
PARRY: Is that what your girlfriend does for you?

RECEPTIONIST: What girl? I didn't notice.
JACK: Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
RECEPTIONIST: Oh, Lydia!
JACK: Lydia. Lydia what?
RECEPTIONIST: God, I have no idea. She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea. I'll call her.
JACK: No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
