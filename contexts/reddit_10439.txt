It’s 4am. I have my first class of the semester in 5 hours and I can’t sleep
I wasted my whole fucking summer looking for jobs and getting nothing. I can’t do internships because my grades suck. My whole family thinks I’m a lazy sack of shit for “not doing anything” and instead of relaxing for two months I was just stressing to make sure I could make $100 a month

I’m stressed because literally nobody around me fucking needs me.
