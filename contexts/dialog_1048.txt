KAREN: When? When are you going to do it?
BILL: Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten- - and you're going to be on time.
MARGO: Yes, sir.
LLOYD: City Hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters - I see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...
BILL: It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
MARGO: I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
LLOYD: Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
KAREN: What are you going to wear?
MARGO: Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
BILL: The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.
