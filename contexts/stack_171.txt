What is Visual Studio Code? Is it an efficient tool for Swift Development? Scrolling to the #Linkedin feeds I have come across the term #VSCode. Please, anybody, explain the pure purpose of the tool or it's really trending in development <blockquote>  Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.</blockquote>I have a doubt it's a code once and export to multiple platforms like a tool.
