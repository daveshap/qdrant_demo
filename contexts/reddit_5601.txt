This is a specific job transition but I’m looking to transition into becoming a development/continuing education coordinator with a background in administrative assistant work. How do I stand out in a cover letter?
Hi everyone, I’ve been working as a legal administrative assistant for nearly five years in my city. I’m frankly over doing this as I want to do something that has me more involved. I found a job posting for a professional development coordinator at a firm that I really want to work at. The ad doesn’t say that any experience is required but it says experience is preferred (doesn’t specify how many years experience either). PDCs are involved in continuing legal education programs for legal professionals like lawyers, students, and paralegals

How do I stand out with my cover letter AND resume with no experience? I KNOW I’d be good and actually content with this role. I have ideas about learning programs that I haven’t seen implemented at any firm AFAIK, and I’ve been around the firms in my area.

I’ve done permanent and temp roles, and I’ve learned a lot about each firm’s business and resources. I’ve worked at small, medium, and large law firms. I’m also constantly reading legal industry publications during downtime. Having been an assistant, I know where some lawyers might be lacking in their skills based on the questions they’ve asked my colleagues and I. And those skills are teachable and would make better use of their time (like less time wasting)

I just don’t know how to put all this on my cover letter and resume especially when the applications are to be sent through a software that filters out applications based on key words
