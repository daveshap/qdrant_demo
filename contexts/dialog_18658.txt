SOFIE: Mom's such a cutie.
MUMFORD: People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
SOFIE: She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time. It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
MUMFORD: Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
SOFIE: Is that the technical description of what I've got?
MUMFORD: Is she against you getting help?
SOFIE: We don't discuss it.
MUMFORD: Something's bothering her.
SOFIE: Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you marry beneath yourself"..."
MUMFORD: Please... forgive me.
SOFIE: What?
MUMFORD: Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right?
MUMFORD: Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch? Just kidding.
SOFIE: You've got a funny idea of funny.
MUMFORD: I've offended you!
SOFIE: No.
MUMFORD: Really? What would it take?
SOFIE: Is this the treatment?
MUMFORD: Sorry... I'm done.
SOFIE: 'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
