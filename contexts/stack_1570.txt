What happens if you manually turn a moving DC motor the opposite way If I have a brushed DC motor moving at a slow speed, and I apply a force to it in the opposite direction, enough for it to rotate the other way, does this damage the motor?I have a steering wheel connected to the shaft of the motor.I'm trying add resistance to the steering wheel when it turns, and this was one idea.
