[META] Important Reminder (or "Make NeutralPolitics Great Again")
Hi all,

Many of you have recently noted a drop in the quality of discussion on NeutralPolitics. We on the mod team have noted the same, and would like to remind everyone of a few key rules that are critical to the success of the sub.

## Assume good faith

We are all here because we want the best for our respective country and collective world. We don't always agree - in fact, we shouldn't always agree. This space is for us to bounce ideas off of a variety of perspectives, and to gain understanding based on how they respond.
As such, assume good faith when interacting with other members of the NeutralPolitics community. The fact that you and another user advocate for different solutions doesn't mean that you aren't both trying for the best outcome. You may view their solution as bad, and they probably view yours likewise. Accept that and look at the evidence together.


## Sweat the details

Each of us has wide-reaching opinions built on mountains of small facts and assumptions that accumulate to form a worldview. It's all too easy to avoid questioning those assumptions, but this community is an opportunity to test them in order to expand our own understanding of politics and society. If a discussion seems to have come to an impasse, try exploring the components that make up your respective opinions.


## Show your work

This community is dedicated first and foremost to quality information and clear presentation of solid logic. Only with those can we fuel quality discussion. Take the time to understand why you believe what you believe, show us the evidence or underlying logic, and cite your sources.


## Engage with the argument, not the person

Things can get heated when discussing hot-button topics, but please stay focused on the argument, not on making attacks against the person. Even when that doesn't result in a flame war, it still shuts down productive discussion.


We will be increasing our presence in the subreddit, including distinguished posts to provide pointers when we see comments that may not merit removal, but are still not in line with the standard of quality that you all have (hopefully!) come to expect of this subreddit. If you have any questions or suggestions, we are as always happy to chat.

Thank you for reading and let's keep up our reputation as the best place for political discussion on reddit!
