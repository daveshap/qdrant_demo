Sci-fi novel about colonists on a jungle planet with butterflies I'm looking for a book about a where a spacecraft of people go to follow up on an initial colonization party to an Earth-like jungle planet.They find an all-but-abandoned settlement, surrounded by high fences, but with no Idea what has happened to the initial team.They set out through the jungle, and find members of the original team living as savages, with their minds burnt out due to the fact that they were getting high on butterfly pheromones.Or something like that.
