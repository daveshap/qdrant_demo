BREE: I saw Mr. Faber. You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
KLUTE: Yeah.
BREE: Is that all you have to say?
KLUTE: What am I supposed to say?
BREE: Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more. I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
