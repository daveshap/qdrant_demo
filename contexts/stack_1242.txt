Sync two postgres databases from two sperate locations with no network I have 2 postgres databases running the same schemes on two different computers, that are not guaranteed to have any network connection while having to handle read/write requests. Because they operate on two different locations, I'm trying to find a solution to merge them once in a while to keep data updated in both (I can connect them every couple of week, or pass files with a flash drive).  My main concern is that this databases have unique values in some of the tables (Auto Increment Primary Keys), and I'm not sure how to handle this - what if both dbs create the same key, for different data? Are there any tools that can merge automatically and output changes that were done?(If it matters, using postgres 10, ubuntu env.)Thanks
