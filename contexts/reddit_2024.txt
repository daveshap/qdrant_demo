Unfortunate truth for people making final college decisions: School prestige does matter quite a bit for finance.
I ended up browsing this a sub a lot this year to get back to speed on the college application process to help my sibling. Fortunately, people know that school prestige isn’t everything, but there is some misinformation regarding it for finance. 



School prestige DOES matter a lot for finance. This is due to the fact that you are in a client-facing role and you’d rather have an analyst from Wharton or Stanford representing you over someone from Penn State, all things being equal. While there are plenty that break in outside of the “target” schools, outside of students from UVA, Mich, Berkeley, Kelley, etc. You don’t see much from schools like Iowa or PSU.



This is somewhat of a cycle, as alums from targets prefer students from their school, but it’s not impossible to break in. That being said, if you’re looking for the easiest route into Wall Street, I’d consider taking on more debt to go to a “better” perceived school.



Edit: didn’t even get to mention top management consulting firms. If you’re shooting for MBB, if you don’t go to a target AND have a near perfect GPA and resume, you have almost no shot. Even I couldn’t get an offer there back when I was in undergrad.
