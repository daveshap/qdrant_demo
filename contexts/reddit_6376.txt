Helpful Guide to Interviewing
I found this document that I used to send to my clients before they went on an interview. It's 13 pages long so I will post them 1 at a time so that everyone on here can benefit from them. Please feel free to add to this if you found more advice to help people be more successful when interviewing for a job.

**Overview** 


* 70% of a successful interview is enthusiasm, excitement, and energy. 1: Smile 2: Stay positive 3: Use 60-80% eye contact 4: If you don't know what to do with your hands, talk with them 
* 20% of the interview is selling you 
* 10% of the interview is the close. 1: The interview is a sales call and you're the product 2: Ask questions 3: Overcome objections 


**Before the Interview** 

* Dress in a plain navy or dark colored business suit
* Men: White shirt and conservative tie, dark socks, formal, well shined shoes 
* Women: Light colored blouse, conservative pumps (color of suit), light colored stockings 
* Research the company 
* Arrive 10-15 Minutes early before an interview 
* Bring a copy of your resume 
* Prepare a copy of any references 
* Bring a pen and notebooks to take notes before, during, and after the interview
* Prepare questions to ask  during the interview 
* Greet everyone in the office with a smile and hello 
* Fill out all applications neatly and completely
* Greet the interviewer with a smile and by their last name
* Give a firm handshake 
* Psyche yourself up! It's ok to be nervous or a little frightened. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain! 
* Be prepared for the interview because you won't get a second chance to make a first impression                                                 

**During the interview**

* Be yourself. People can tell when you're faking it
* Have a positive attitude
* Be confident, you're the kind of employee this employer needs 
* Represent yourself honestly 
* Maintain direct eye contact
* Sit up straight
* Use FEB selling to answer employer's questions
* Ask questions about the position, company, and the interviewer 
* Don't ask questions about salary, commission, bonuses, vacations, ot anything else the company can do for you. Wait until you've gotten the job offer
* Don't get too comfortable, remain professional and on guard 
* Don't ever say anything negative and be careful when talking about past and present employers 

**After the interview**

* Jot down notes to help you remember the highlights of the interview (questions, your impressions, your performance). This will help you in future interviews and writing thank you letters 
* Fax, email, or drop off a thank you letter within 24 hours
