TOM: Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
GRACE: I don't know if I can.
TOM: Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
TOM: Where did you get Pilgrim from?
GRACE: We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
TOM: That must have been pretty special.
GRACE: Are you afraid of anything?
TOM: Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess. What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
