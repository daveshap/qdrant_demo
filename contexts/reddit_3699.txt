Ugh - please don’t follow this guys example >_<
So matched with a guy on something called “Happn” and seemed normal at first. Sadly he turned into this guy in the space of 48h ....

Sunday night: 

Him: What's your shifts like during the week

Me: Fairly busy as we’ve got a lot on atm 😊

Him: Alright, enjoy

Today - 

Him: Not to be person but I get put off by bullsh*t

Me: I haven’t bullsh*tted you but have been busy. I did explain this and I apologise for any miscommunications on my part

Him: I think someone needs punishment

Me: I’m not into negging or mind games. Sorry but that’s how I feel

Him: Same here but generally delayers are flakers

Him (literally 30 seconds later): You've got kids dont you

Me: No I don’t have kids thank you very much. I have a career that’s more important right now. That and my Nan was severely ill last month with an angina attack. Over the weekend I was out with family celebrating my uncles 70th birthday and this week I have a sh*t ton of meetings - it’s a busy time for my work.

Him: Lol the massage is on the house then. You need it

Me: I have a masseuse for that paid for by my boss

**********************************************
Honestly don’t get people like this. My profile doesn’t mention kids nor do I have them so no idea where that came from. Whenever he messaged I replied. If I was busy I would say so and that I would reply as soon as I can....

Yup dodged a bullet there guys

Edit 1: To clarify the messages above are from WhatsApp and on the actual app I had stated I was free on weekends (with the exception of this weekend just gone). Also wasn’t expecting work to pick up so quickly when I downloaded the app. The negging comment was from a previous question of his which I had forgotten to include - he asked for my opinion on it/if I was into it. 

Thanks for all the comments and advice though!
