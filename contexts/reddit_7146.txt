(Very) Early Stage Startup Questions to Ask?
I've been job hunting and I'm particularly interested in startups, or at least the startup mentality - I love a small number of coworkers, wearing many hats, taking on a lot of responsibility. I've been at my first professional job for a long time. It's at a small company, ~25 employees, but well-established and profitable. However, the environment is growing increasingly toxic and I find myself feeling smothered and miserable. The feeling is shared among my coworkers.

I recently applied to another job and was surprised when the poster quickly responded back saying they were impressed with my background. In speaking with them for the phone interview, they mentioned that they were a startup that had just received funding and were in the "building-out" stage, with a particular need for my position. If I understood correctly, I would be employee #3-4. I think the idea/product has been implemented and has been in use since ~2008(?), but the company was only put together at the beginning of this year and the founder has basically been doing all of this stuff on his own since then. I should note this startup isn't in cutthroat SF, though it is a software company (nothing like 'the next Facebook' or anything).

I'm *really* eager for a change, and I'm interested in the responsibilities I would have at this company (building out a team, setting foundational processes, etc.), but they are aggressively hiring and looking for someone to start as soon as possible. This has gone from application to final decision in 2 weeks. I feel pressured in that if I ask for additional days to consider, they will go with someone else, which is making me anxious/stressed and wondering if they're looking for the *best* person or the *first* person. (Unsure if this is my anxiety speaking, or the truth.)

So I've been doing research, and I know ultimately this comes down to a risk/reward thing, but I was wondering a few things (I am meeting the CEO for a lunch interview this week):

- What questions would you bring up specifically for a startup that's this early in its life cycle? I've done some research and have a few questions to ask - runway, burn rate - but are there other metrics I need to know? (I'm not too familiar with startup and business terms.) This company is either too new or too below-the-radar for me to find any solid funding information online, although they do have a high retention rate and a decent number of clients. This company has a limited # of competitors, but this company seems to have a more comprehensive/appealing product for the market.

- Is it appropriate to ask about payment? They have indicated that they are looking to make a decision this week, so I'm presumably a top candidate given that this will be my third interview (and both other interviews were very positive, hints of moving forward with me). Essentially, I just want to be sure that I will get a consistent paycheck, at least for the short term as the company is built out, but feel awkward asking about this, even though it's important information and I feel like the company should respect this kind of question. (I am still young and still building out my savings.)

- Is there any other advice for joining a startup that's in such an early stage? I know to expect long hours, doing a lot of business-y things, but am particularly interested to hear of other peoples' experiences. I know there's a significant risk, and I'm tempted to take it since it sounds like it would be a great experience, potentially amazing personal + professional growth, kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, etc., but also I'm usually interested in somewhat established startups, not ones that are literally just getting off the ground.

- Everyone is different, but I'm curious to know - if you were offered a job as a founding member of a startup, would you take it, or would you pass for something more established?

Ultimately a lot will come from meeting the CEO in person this week in terms of how I gauge his personality and what I learn about the company, but I want to be as prepared for this in advance as possible since I will likely need to make a decision if offered ASAP, and I'm struggling to find out exactly how much is appropriate to ask prior to being hired, though I want to make the most informed choice possible. (This may all be moot if they go with someone else, but it's good to know in case I run across something again, and so far the job sounds really promising in my favor!)

Your thoughts are appreciated! I know it comes down to me but I'm looking for as many opinions and unbiased viewpoints as I possibly can. :)
