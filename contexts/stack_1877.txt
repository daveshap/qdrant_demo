Is this a grammatically correct line in a poem: \u201cWill he roll the dice, and follow it to Vegas?\u201d? I want to use the following line in a poem: \"Will he roll the dice, and follow it to Vegas?\" A couple of things to note; firstly, obviously I'm using \"roll the dice\" in both a figurative/idiomatic sense (as in taking a risk), and in a somewhat more literal sense (painting the image of the person actually following the dice that have been rolled to Las Vegas). That being said, my confusion here is if I can get away with using \"follow it\" or if I need to say \"follow them\" .... As I've read online \"dice\" traditionally refers to more than one die (i.e., the plural of die), but in the modern usage, \"dice\" can also be used to refer to the singular (i.e., just one die). So, it seems like if I was referring to the image of just one die, then the way I phrased it could be correct. However, the image I'm trying to paint is the one usually associated with the phrase \"roll the dice\" (i.e., rolling two dice)... So could \"follow it\" still be considered acceptable in this sense... or would I need to use \"follow them\"?... And if not referring to the dice themselves, could using, could the \"it\" be taken to refer to the act of rolling the dice, or would that not work either? Thanks so much in advance!!
