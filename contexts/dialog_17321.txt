TANK: Operator.
CYPHER: I need an exit! Fast!
TANK: Cypher?
CYPHER: There was an accident. A fucking car accident. All of a sudden. Boom. Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
TANK: I got you.
CYPHER: Just get me outta here.
TANK: Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
TANK: Operator.
TRINITY: Tank, it's me.
NEO: Is Morpheus alive?
TRINITY: Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
TANK: Yes. They're moving him. I don't know where yet.
TRINITY: He's alive.
TRINITY: We need an exit!
TANK: You're not far from Cypher.
TRINITY: Cypher, I thought --
TANK: So did we. I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
TRINITY: Got it.
