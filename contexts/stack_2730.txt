Different units on y-axis I was just wondering if you can have different units on the same y-axis? For example, if I'm graphing blood flow, oxygen level and skin temperature against time in one graph. I can put temperature on the secondary y-axis, but I would still have two variables with different units on the primary y-axis. Will this be alright? Or do I need to draw a separate graph for the other variable.
