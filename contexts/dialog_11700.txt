MOLLY: What are you doing here?!
JOHN: I came to see you.
MOLLY: I can see that. Why?
JOHN: Can I come in?
MOLLY: Are you crazy? You'll get caught.
JOHN: Then you come out here.
MOLLY: Then I'll get caught.
JOHN: Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
MOLLY: Alright. I'll come out. Just be quiet.
MOLLY: You really think Eddie killed her?
JOHN: You saw that Michael Meyers display. You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
MOLLY: I guess. It's just hard to believe.
JOHN: You look kind of cold.
MOLLY: I'm okay.
JOHN: Here, take my jacket.
JOHN: Better?
MOLLY: Yeah.
