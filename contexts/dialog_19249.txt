NATHAN: Whoa. No way. You can't enter the kill zone.
DANNY: Since when?
NATHAN: Since you got married. You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
NATHAN: How long's it been?
DANNY: I'm still on my honeymoon.
NATHAN: So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target. You'll get yourself killed. Just keep talking.
DANNY: I will. Inside. There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
NATHAN: Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
