GALE: I snuck in.
BERNIE: You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
GALE: Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
BERNIE: Who am I? You're asking me? You're the big expert for Chrissake! I'm what? The Scumbag
GALE: Was it you? In the plane? Who saved my life?
BERNIE: Me? Listen, I don't give no interviews. That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
GALE: Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record. Was it you? Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse? Why?
