GENE: You remember me?
HUEY: I remember. The big tipper.
GENE: Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
HUEY: Oh, man...
GENE: Please. Something is going to happen...
HUEY: What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
GENE: Please...
HUEY: Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change? You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
