HANNAH: Well, that-that's good. It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
HOLLY: Well-well, like what?
HANNAH: Well, I don't know. We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
HOLLY: Yeah, that's clerical.
HANNAH: No. She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department. That-that can lead to other things.
HOLLY: Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
HANNAH: I'm not! I'm not! I'm trying to be helpful. A person doesn't just say one day, Okay
HOLLY: Yeah, you mean not at my age.
LEE: Oh, please! We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
HOLLY: Yeah, okay, right. Forget it. What's to eat?
LEE: Boy...Holly...Holly.
HOLLY: I just want a salad. You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
HANNAH: What do--? You're being ridiculous.
LEE: You are, Holly. Stop it.
HOLLY: You treat me like a loser.
HANNAH: How?
HOLLY: You never have any faith in my plans. You always undercut my enthusiasm.
HANNAH: Not so! No. I think I've been very supportive. I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
HOLLY: Hmm!
HANNAH: I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially. I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men. There's nothing I would--
HOLLY: Uh, losers! All losers!
HANNAH: You're too demanding.
HOLLY: You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
HANNAH: You're crazy! That's not true.
HOLLY: Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
LEE: Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
HANNAH: Oh, now--
LEE: She's going through a really rough time right now.
HOLLY: Why are you so upset?
LEE: You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while! I'm just suffocating.
HOLLY: What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
HANNAH: Look. Listen. Listen. You want to write? Write.
HOLLY: What's the matter?
HANNAH: Write! Let's just not talk about it anymore.
HOLLY: Good.
HANNAH: Take...take a year. Take six months. Whatever you want. Who knows? Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
HANNAH: What's the matter? What's the matter with you? You look pale. You okay?
LEE: I'm-I'm okay. Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden. I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
HANNAH: Yeah?
LEE: I think we need to eat.
