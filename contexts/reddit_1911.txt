really wanna be happy for others getting accepted but there’s always smth in the back of my head
Seeing others (who aren’t as serious about school) getting accepted into schools I really wanted to get into is hard to deal with. Of course I support them but there’s something in the back of my head that makes me feel like shit. Especially since I watched them fool around for most of high school while I stayed back working my ass off. And the funny thing is that I’m always the one they’d turn to for help with school!

Not saying they don’t deserve it and I know there are a lot of factors at play here but idk kinda just feel low about everything rn...
