SYLVIA: You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.

KIRKEBY: Don't you ever stop talking?
KIRKEBY: Where do you live?
SYLVIA: I told you -- with my mother.
KIRKEBY: Where does she live?
SYLVIA: A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
KIRKEBY: All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
SYLVIA: Like hell you will. You'll buy me a cab.
KIRKEBY: Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
SYLVIA: You mean you bring other girls up here?
KIRKEBY: Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.
BUD: Oh. Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
MRS. DREYFUSS: Something the matter?
BUD: I seem to have dropped my key. Oh -- here it is.
MRS. DREYFUSS: Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
BUD: Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal... Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
