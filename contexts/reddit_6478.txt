Is "working lean" just a euphemism for we'll overwork and underpay you?
My current employer is big on "working lean". Literally every single person in the working level is swamped with work and pressure from customers. Positions are open and candidates are being interviewed, but the "leadership" is taking its own sweet time making decisions and asking for yet another resource estimate.

At this point, everyone is doing the job of at least 2 people and the management espouses the philosophy of working lean. I think going forward, I'll avoid any company who mentions this as part of their pitch during the interview process. Is this the same for everyone?
