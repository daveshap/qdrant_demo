Is it legal (under U.S. law) for Hunter Biden to have served on the board of Burisma Holdings (a politically sensitive natural gas producer in Ukraine) while Joe Biden was vice-president of the U.S.?
Burisma Holdings is a Ukrainian natural gas producer. It holds 35 government concessions to produce hydrocarbons (per Reuters, see https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-burisma-factb/factbox-burisma-the-obscure-ukrainian-gas-company-at-the-heart-of-us-political-row-idUSKBN1W91UG)

It has been alleged that the owner of Burisma— Mykola Zlochevsky, the former ecology minister of Ukraine— was able to secure the concessions from the Ukrainian government via some corrupt means. (I heard on NPR this morning and found this NYT article with some broad strokes on this saga but does not address the concessions directly: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/europe/corruption-ukraine-joe-biden-son-hunter-biden-ties.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)

Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma in April 2014 and was allegedly paid up to $50k per month for his services. Hunter had tested positive for cocaine and was discharged from a ceremonial post with the U.S. Navy in February 2014. He remained on the Burisma board until April of this year.

He is a Yale educated lawyer who did some lobbying work while his father was in the Senate. What specific expertise did he bring to bear on the governance of a natural gas company in Ukraine?

I have seen some reporting that Ukrainian officials looked into this and said Hunter broke no Ukrainian laws. There is no legal limit in Ukraine on board compensation. (https://nypost.com/2019/05/16/joe-biden-and-son-hunter-cleared-of-wrongdoing-by-ukraine-prosecutor/) But how is that relevant? Why is that the standard?

I don’t know if Biden’s conduct runs afoul of any U.S. laws. Is it legal?
