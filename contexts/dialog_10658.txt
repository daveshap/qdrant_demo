DODGE: So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
MURPHY: A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
DODGE: Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
MURPHY: It looks like it.
GREER: So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
MURPHY: We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
DODGE: You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
MURPHY: So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
GREER: Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
MURPHY: It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
EPPS: Why not call for help?
MURPHY: For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
DODGE: Last thing we want is extra partners.
EPPS: Or uninvited guests.
GREER: I heard that.
MURPHY: Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
DODGE: Yeah, yeah. I'm on it.
MURPHY: The sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
