PAINE: Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
SUSAN: What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
PAINE: And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
MCGANN: Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
SAUNDERS: How'd you like a punch in the nose?
MCGANN: What! Who?
SAUNDERS: That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
MCGANN: Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy. Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
SAUNDERS: My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
MCGANN: Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
JEFFERSON: You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
MCGANN: H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
JEFFERSON: You have? Will you come in a minute, Miss Saunders.
MCGANN: Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
JEFFERSON: Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a lot.
SAUNDERS: Go ahead--punch.
JEFFERSON: Punch?
SAUNDERS: I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
JEFFERSON: Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
SAUNDERS: We're going right ahead with--*what*?
JEFFERSON: Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
SAUNDERS: One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
JEFFERSON: Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
SAUNDERS: Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
JEFFERSON: Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
SAUNDERS: My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
JEFFERSON: I know--but you--you're going to help.
SAUNDERS: If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
JEFFERSON: Right.
SAUNDERS: Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
JEFFERSON: Oh, but this one is so simple.
SAUNDERS: I see. *This* one is so simple--
JEFFERSON: And with your help--
SAUNDERS: Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
JEFFERSON: Oh, just a day--
SAUNDERS: A *day*!
JEFFERSON: Tonight.
SAUNDERS: Tonight. Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
JEFFERSON: Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going--
SAUNDERS: Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
JEFFERSON: How?
SAUNDERS: You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
JEFFERSON: Committee, huh?
SAUNDERS: Committee.
JEFFERSON: Why?
SAUNDERS: That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
JEFFERSON: Why?
SAUNDERS: Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
JEFFERSON: Yes, I see that.
SAUNDERS: Good. Where are we?
JEFFERSON: Some committee's got it.
SAUNDERS: Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
JEFFERSON: Calendar?
SAUNDERS: That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
JEFFERSON: What's that?
SAUNDERS: What?
JEFFERSON: The Steering Committee.
SAUNDERS: Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
JEFFERSON: Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee?
SAUNDERS: A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
JEFFERSON: *This* is.
SAUNDERS: Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
JEFFERSON: We're over in the House.
SAUNDERS: Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down. Are you catching on, Senator?
JEFFERSON: Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
SAUNDERS: Pardon?
JEFFERSON: I said--shall we get started *now* or--
SAUNDERS: Yes--sure. Why not? You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil?
JEFFERSON: No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
SAUNDERS: Thanks very much.
JEFFERSON: And a *lot* of paper!
SAUNDERS: I wouldn't wait if I were you.
MCGANN: What do you mean? What's going on?
SAUNDERS: The Head Man's writing a Bill.
MCGANN: A Bill! Not *him*!
MCGANN: What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
SAUNDERS: Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann--
