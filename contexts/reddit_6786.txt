I emailed a recruiter to negotiate salary and they never replied to my email. What should I do next?
I received a full time offer from a company I interned with. I was thrilled to receive an offer from them but found the offered salary was a little underwhelming. With this, I emailed them asking for an increase after I explained my rational as to why I was worth the extra money. I was expecting an email back saying yes or no, or even an email with a counter offer. It has, however, been a little over a week since I sent my email and I've heard nothing back. The deadline to accept my offer is slowly approaching. How do I handle this situation? 

For context, I know this recruiter fairly well as I spent a lot of time with them during my internship and they have always emailed me back within a few days during previous communications. Is there anything I should do as my deadline approaches?
