It’s crushing to know that I’ll never be normal.
I never got to live the normal childhood with non-abusive parents in a great home environment. 

Depression and anxiety have ruined me, and I know they’ll never go away. I’ll be like this forever, even if I did get it to a mild state.

 I’ll never get to make stupid mistakes and grow up, bc w every little mistake my parents scream at me and emotionally abuse me, so that’s always made me terrified to do anything that they think is wrong. They don’t let me grow. They never did. But my mental illness made me grow a lot faster a lot sooner. 

I’ll live with the knowledge that I tried to kill myself on March 21, 2020 and never got to tell anyone because they wouldn’t care. My parents would just say how disappointed they were about how I didn’t tell them earlier and be all petty and shit, but my friends would probably just brush it off and say “oh wow sorry” or something. I don’t want to burden them anyway. My parents have called me a burden to them multiple times.

Is that all I’ll ever be? A burden? Someone who has to pay another person in order to share their feelings, because no one else will listen?

I wish I could’ve just lived a normal fucking childhood. But it’s gone. It’s fucking gone and I can never get it back. I’m done
