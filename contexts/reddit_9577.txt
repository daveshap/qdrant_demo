What's going to happen to education students/student teachers?
So I'm starting a GA position at my university's education department in May (supposed to be, who knows now) working with students who are going into their student teaching practicums/internships to become state certified teachers. 

Now that all universities in my state are remote/online learning and all k-12 schools closed for at least the next 4 weeks (some have opted for more) - What do you think will happen to students that have had their student teaching completely halted? Do you think they'll have to start all over next semester, finish the k-12 school year with whatever time is left over, or something else?

I know this will vary state to state, but I'm wondering if any universities have come up with their own solutions yet.

Hope you're all hanging in there and staying safe!
