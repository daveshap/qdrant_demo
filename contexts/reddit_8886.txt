One year after the Iran Deal, in what ways is the world better and worse off?
[This Q&A with policy experts](http://www.rand.org/blog/2016/07/rand-experts-qa-on-the-iran-nuclear-deal-one-year-later.html) got me wondering if, looking at the big picture, the world is in a better or worse position as a result of the [Iran Nuclear deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) signed one year ago.

Experts on that RAND panel and [elsewhere](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/assessing-the-iran-nuclear-deal-one-year-after-it-was-reached/2016/07/13/cf3de73a-4828-11e6-acbc-4d4870a079da_story.html) are nearly united in the view that Iran's compliance with the letter of the agreement has been swift, complete and open. However, many of the same people also say the "spirit" of the agreement has not held and the hopes that it would lead to a broader rapprochement have not materialized.
