Are there any average people here?
To me it seems like everyone in this subreddit has a 4.0 GPA, 1590 SAT, 20 AP classes, started a nonprofit, did five internships, won international awards at science fairs, founded ten clubs at their school, played fifteen varsity sports, literally cured cancer, and applying to all the ivies. Please tell me there's someone here who's just average like me! Average grades, average ECs, applying to average schools? Like actually average? Don't hit me with "my ECs are pretty bad, I started a business with 100k yearly revenue" (yeah I actually saw a post like that on r/reversechanceme). Anyone? ðŸ˜­
