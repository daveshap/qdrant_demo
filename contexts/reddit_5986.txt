What can I do with an AS in Liberal Arts?
A little background here, I worked a few jobs as a young woman and then ended up on SSI for mental illness. While on SSI I decided to pursue a degree at the local community college and earned my associate's in 2012. In 2016 Social Security decided that I am well enough to work and so they took me off the program. Since 2016 I have had 5 jobs, the longest one lasting 7 months and the shortest lasting about 4 weeks. I've been unemployed since December 2017 and now I'm searching for work again. 

Most of my jobs have been in retail except one stint at a call center which went very, very badly (anxiety issues and call center work don't mix). I feel like I wasted my time getting my associate's degree because I just don't know what to do with it. I guess my question is twofold: what does one do with my degree, and how can I make my resume better with such large gaps?
