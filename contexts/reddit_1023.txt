I made a HUGE breakthrough today!
I have a huge huge huge issue with doctors and being touched in general due to a sexual assault in the past, but I am really behind on my health and was overdue for a lot of things. I finally went to an ob/gyn for an annual checkup, and I was okay! I did it! I went through with the entire exam without a panic attack even though I was shaking and crying even thinking about scheduling an appointment. I'm so proud of myself and I hope I continue to fight through my anxiety and past traumas as effectively as I did today.

Edit: Thank you guys for all of your support. This sub is amazing and You all have helped me so much. I responded to quite a bit of comments in the beginning but it's takes me a while to respond and I'd spend too much time replying to things. If you want to talk you can message me. Thank you all so so so so much and I love you. love And thanks for the gold and silver!
