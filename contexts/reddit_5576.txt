How long should I wait for a promotion
Last Friday I found out that a passed a major professional exam in my field, that is in many ways harder than the bar exam. I messaged my employer about it Friday after I found out and again on Monday. The response on Monday was that they would be in touch with me soon. When my name was added to the national registry of people I have received a few offers for positions due to my new certification.  All of my peers at different agencies have been promoted Monday morning when they found out they passed.

What amount of a grace period should i give my current employer regarding my promotion?

Dub question: Should I give a two week notice if I leave? I have only been there since February and i'm starting to think they don't have confidence in me.
