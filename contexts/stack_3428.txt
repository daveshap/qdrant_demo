Is nonce of HMAC secured message considered secret? Consider app using say, HMAC-SHA2, with securely pre-shared symmetric key. Are the nonces of exchanged messages considered secret as well?<br> Or in other words, does its easy predictability or even outright knowledge(plaintext) of nonce to attacker compromise/reduce HMAC security?Some sources suggest using cryptographically secure PRNG for nonce generation as if the PRNG algorithm/seed was part of preshared secret which confuses me.
