TV Show identification: 90's live action space kids show in another part of the galaxy This might be a serious long shot - there was a show on YTV (Canadian kids channel).  It was live action, and I believe that each of the characters had a particular color, like red/yellow, that identified their vehicles.  They were in space, and somehow got to the wrong side of the galaxy. While there, they met an alien on a planet.  On that planet they found a pet, but the alien said that the animal was \"very nutritious\".  The only line I remember was \"Nutritious?   As in, rhymes with delicious?\" from one of the skeptical (presumably) human characters.Any ideas?edit: I seem to remember that there was a \"space gate\" of some kind that they used to travel, and for some reason they couldn't get back home after they went in.  There was fighting against some kind of main adversarial army/person.  The pet alien thing was a sort of bald sheep.Edit 2: it is not \"space cases\although there is a similar premise.  It was a lot more CGI than that, and more \"military\" than \"school\"
