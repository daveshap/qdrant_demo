HARRY: What?
CHILI: I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
HARRY: I had to tell 'em something.
CHILI: Never say anything unless you have to.
CHILI: You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
HARRY: I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
CHILI: That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
HARRY: His shrink's trainer.
