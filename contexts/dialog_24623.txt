MIKE: Claire?
CLAIRE: What do you want?
MIKE: Open the door, will you?
CLAIRE: I can't open it.
MIKE: It's just me. I want to talk to you. Let me in...
CLAIRE: You put me life in danger.
MIKE: No, you'll be safe. We're gonna pick him up again...
CLAIRE: And then what? I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country! You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail! And you knew that all the goddamn time!
