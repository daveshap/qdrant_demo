DAE purposely stay up late so that they are so exhausted when they try to sleep instead of tossing & turning due to anxiety?
I am in college and I purposely stay up late studying so that I am so exhausted that I’ll go to sleep a lot easier than actually trying to get some sleep and dealing with my thoughts about everything I should’ve/should done/do. 

EDIT: Thank you guys for all making me feel not alone in this
