BUFF: But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
JEFF: He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
TIM: Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
JEFF: No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
BEE-BEE: We are?
JEFF: Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
BUFF: Pony's coming here to the corner?!
JEFF: Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
TIM: Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
JEFF: Sooze wants to see him.
TIM: Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
BUFF: Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
BEE-BEE: Yeah, when's he coming?
JEFF: I don't know. Later. I don't know.
BUFF: Yes!
JEFF: God, I haven't seen you all day.
SOOZE: You could've come over.
JEFF: I know, I know, I know.
JEFF: Oh! Trim it!
SOOZE: I hate that.
JEFF: Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
SOOZE: No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
JEFF: Okay, so maybe later.
