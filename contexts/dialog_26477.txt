LENNY: Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
LEX: Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
LENNY: The one Superman wrecked up?
LEX: Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me. Did you hear that?
LENNY: You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
LEX: There!
LENNY: Hey! He looks . . . normal.
LEX: He's . . . beautiful. Perfect.
