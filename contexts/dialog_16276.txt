GARY: Who was that?
DEAN: That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
GARY: Jesus, I have heard about him.
DEAN: We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
JOHN: Dog, I have found the cash!
DOG: The stupid bastards! Count it!
JOHN: Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
DOG: We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
JOHN: But... Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
