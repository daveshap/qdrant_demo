RATH: Listen to me, Bain. Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information. It bothered you, but you didn't care. How do I know this? Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
BAIN: I ain't scared of you.
RATH: Yeah you are and you hate it. You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't. That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
BAIN: If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
RATH: All right, Bain. Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
