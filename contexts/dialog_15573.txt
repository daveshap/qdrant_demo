TENZIN GYATSO: And the United Nations? Surely?
KASHAG MEMBER: The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called El Salvador"."
TENZIN GYATSO: Where is that?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: In the Americas.
TENZIN GYATSO: So, we must face China and all her might alone.
KASHAG MEMBER: Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
TENZIN GYATSO: With much bloodshed.
KASHAG MEMBER: I am afraid.
TENZIN GYATSO: I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
KASHAG MEMBER: Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
TENZIN GYATSO: He is a capable man.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
TENZIN GYATSO: And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
KASHAG MEMBER: Yes.
TENZIN GYATSO: Time to study.
