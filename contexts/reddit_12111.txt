I think it's just hard to get male attention period!
I'm just not enough no matter what I do. I'm too unattractive/ugly. I'll be 28 soon and never had attention from guys and I'm still a virgin. Everytime  I even stare at a guy they either quickly look away quickly, blank their eyes real hard, or they'll project their eyes from looking my way. I'm almost always ignored. I'm just a straight up trashy looking person. I'm gross and disgusting.
