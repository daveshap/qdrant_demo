How to ask about missing Covid pay premium
A little background before I start.
I work for a fast food restaurant and our hours are all managed through an app we are invited to when hired.  The owners have a few stores so they have a big group message feature they supply updates in.  This includes things like new menu items, workplace policies, and in this case responses to the pandemic.

On March 23 we recurved what looked like a copy pasted message from one of the higher ups in the fast food chain. It stated starting on As of that day (3/23) employees will be receiving a 25% pay increase until further notice.  The owner of the store I worked at then sent a follow up message stating it would go into affect 2 days later (3/25) due to when I payroll reset.  

I noticed at first that nothing was changing, but just figured it was taking an extra cycle to come into affect.  I was paid again this morning and once again it didn’t seem to reflect this update.  I went into the app we use and added up the hours for the previous two weeks, the last pay period, and with tax the amount matched the amount I was paid.  That is, without the 25% “hazard pay”. It’s been over a month so I know that it should have come into affect by now.

I’m one of the newer employees, started just over two months ago, and one of the younger ones as well (18).  

I would think the issue isn’t only affecting me, but none have my coworkers have brought anything up or said anything either.  

What would be the best or most professional way to inquire about the hazard pay not being implemented/ working properly?

Any advice on how to proceed with this would be great, thank you in advance!
