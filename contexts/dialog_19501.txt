PREACHER: Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
ICEY SPOON: How?
PREACHER: She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
ICEY SPOON: What!
PREACHER: She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar. She was drinking.
PREACHER: I tried to save her.
ICEY SPOON: I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
PREACHER: The devil wins sometimes!
