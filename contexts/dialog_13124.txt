EVELYN: Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
PRICE: Asking the wrong person again.
EVELYN: I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
PRICE: -- I pose you the same question --
EVELYN: -- and who's next on your list?
PRICE: If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
EVELYN: -- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
PRICE: -- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
EVELYN: -- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
