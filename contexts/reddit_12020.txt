I'm fucking useless and I need to die
I go to work, I try to make friends I try to talk to people, I try to get girls interested in me. I'm just so fucking unattractive, pathetic and I'm not interesting enough for anyone to give a fuck about what I have to say. I'm just a boring fucking piece if shit. 

Yaya someone's talking to me and I'm having a conversation but not without me saying something really fucking awkward! 

I'm useless and socially inadequate. No one will ever want to spend the rest of their life with me. No one will ever love who I am, no one cares who I am, I'm nobody and it's always going to be that way. 

My fucking family members don't even listen to what I have to say! I have to say things over and over, what I say doesn't matter, what I believe doesn't matter. I'm close minded to them. 

I'll always be unattractive and awkward, no one will ever truly care.

I fucking suck.

Attractive people get everything in life and I'm not attractive. I spam likes on Tinder and rarely get any matches. I'm fucking pathetic.
