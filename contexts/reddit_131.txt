A suicidal friend
So my parents jambe been friends with two collègues forever and they have a daughter. This daughter is the same age as me but she redoubled twice, which made at one point be in my brother’s class. 
I’ve always been friendly with her and I knew she was a bit of a social outcast but I didn’t think it was that bad. I haven’t spoken to her for over a year and she called me the other day to see if we could see each other. I felt alarmed and made time for it but then she cancelled so we called instead and I found out she was miserable and it was pretty apparent she was having suicidal thoughts. I tried to reassure her and listened to her problems. Then I checked in on her everyday and she always answered really sadly. Today she suddenly asked to meet up again and I told her I didn’t have time today but I could tomorrow and she said “okay...”. Then I asked what’s wrong and she said “I dunno things are getting so difficult I can barely stand on my two feet anymore”. Should I alert her parents???? The other day she fell asleep and didn t answer one of my messages and I just assumed she’d gone to bed but the next morning she said “don’t worry I’m still alive”. Apparently her mom had thought she’d killed herself.
Anyways, what do you think I should do? For reference we’re 18.
