meaning of trenchantly in this sentence I'm not sure what \"trenchantly\" means in this sentence:<blockquote>  While the rest of the firm gradually acquired a new persona, mortgages remained more trenchantly the same.</blockquote>Here is the definition I found of trenchant:<blockquote>    vigorous or incisive in expression or style.  \"she heard angry voices, not loud, yet certainly trenchant\"  archaicliterary  (of a weapon or tool) having a sharp edge.  </blockquote>Thanks for the help!
