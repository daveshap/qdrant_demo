Reminder to check if the recruiter is legit
I recently got contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn and we set up time to chat.

The she emails and asks to push the time back by 30 min “because she got a client call”.  (Hmmmm... usually recruiters aren’t this obvious that job hunters aren’t clients.)

Anyway, before the call I realize I had never heard of her company before and I look up the website.

It’s a super basic, Squarespace website. Essentially, it doesn’t look legit. 

I decided before the call I would not work with her to get me a job. The conversation we have on the phone further confirms this. I’m actually mad at myself for telling her a bit too much about my income expectations. Plus it turns out she tried to get me on a job I’d already applied to.

I’m glad I checked the website though. A recruiter is presenting you to a company and if this person doesn’t know what they’re doing, what happens to you?

Anyway, just some advice!
