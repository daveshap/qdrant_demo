Do you ever just want to talk to someone about your suicidal feelings but then anxiety grabs you by the throat and chokes you until you have a breakdown?
I’m autistic so I’m very prone to the classic ‘autistic meltdowns’. I feel like my condition stops me from being happy and normal, instead I’m viewed as very weird and obsessive.

People in the past have scared me enough to barely talk verbally nowadays. I know if I were normal, I’d be happy and successful. No one will accept that my condition has made me a failure.

Yet I can’t talk about it to anyone about this, I just end up exploding and then overdose on my sleeping meds (nowhere near enough to kill me, but enough to knock me out pretty fucking hard).

I dunno, I’m a mess tbh! :)
