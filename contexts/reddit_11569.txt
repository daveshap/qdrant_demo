Corona virus
So I’ve posted on here before of my mothers cancer diagnosis (post probably deleted) and the coronavirus is in the county right next to my small town and it’s scaring the fuck out of me as my mother could just fucking vanish if she gets this
     I really don’t want her to get it, but knowing my luck bad shits gonna happen. Ive been so fucking stressed and it’s hard to think. Her immune system is horrible and it’s hard for her to recover from a common cold so I can’t imagine what that shit will do to her.
