BILLY: What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
STU: Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
BILLY: And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
STU: Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
