I can't stop thinking about some old explicit text exchanges I found between my GF and another guy
Sorry for the throwaway. I think I just need some of you guys to slap some sense into me.

A few months ago I was concerned that my GF of two years was lying to me about something. Turns out she was. It wasn't a huge deal, and we've discussed it and since worked everything out. Thing is, to FIND this "truth," I did some snooping. I'm not proud of myself, but I looked through her phone.

In addition to what I discovered, I ALSO discovered a number of old texts between her and a former fling. Now I KNOW these were before me, so really I have no reason to be upset. But they were sexually explicit. And in some ways, they were more sexually explicit than any exchanges that have ever occurred between her and me. She seemed more aggressive, less inhibited. 

We love each other very much and know she's the one, I just can't stop thinking about what I read. And to top it off, she's still kind of friends with this guy. They don't talk or anything, but he still comes around when a bunch of other friends do.... and while I openly know they "dated" (or whatever), she obviously has no idea I know about their exchanges - or any details of their sex life. It's driving me crazy!
