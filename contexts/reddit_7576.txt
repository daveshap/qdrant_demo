Thoughts about post-graduate executive programs versus MBA?
I'm running a startup and we are about to launch with seed funding. I feel like I still know too little about management and leadership in general. I see that there are some courses followed by Oxford/Stanford/MIT for executives. What are your thoughts on those versus a 2-year MBA?

P.S. I seek knowledge, not something to add on a resume (though it would be nice)
