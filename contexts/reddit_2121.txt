Don't be like me
I know early decision and early action decisions are coming out soon, and as a current college freshman who frequented this sub last year, I wanted to give some advice on how to handle the decisions and enjoy the coming years.

When I was in high school, I was a good student like most of you. I was consistently ranked top 10 in a class of 600 at a competitive high school in a competitive area. I scored 240 on the PSAT and 2400 on the SAT when I was in 10th grade, and decided to take the ACT later just to prove a point to a friend that I could ace all three. I participated in a bunch of math contests - I won some local awards and went to ARML and qualified for AIME for those who are familiar with the math competition circuit. I did environmental research with local town officials during three major research projects over the course of my high school career. I entered in the big science contests (Siemens, Intel, etc.), but didn't win anything beyond the local level. I did some other clubs (Science Olympiad, some honor societies), did some volunteer service, did a summer math program, and had a sport outside of school that I was good but not great at. 

Over the summer entering my senior year, I constantly checked this sub for advice on my essays, how to present myself on my applications, etc. I made a list of 13 colleges to apply to, ranging from guaranteed full scholarship safeties to some of the best colleges in the world. I kept reading here how top colleges were never a guarantee for anyone, but I was confident I could get in minus maybe one or two. I submitted all of my applications regular decision. I heard back from my 2 safeties (both outside of top 50 on US news) first. But then when the other decisions started coming in, the results weren't quite what I expected. In total, I was accepted at my two safeties, 3 that were in the 30 - 50 range on US News, and one top 20. I was denied from 4 (all top 10) and waitlisted at 3, including one state school ranked outside of the top 25. I was shocked, angry, upset, everything. I was expecting to maybe not get into the top ivies, but to be waitlisted at multiple colleges outside the top 15 was a shock.

For the coming months, I was bitter and resentful toward everyone. My best friend was accepted at MIT, his top choice, and instead of being happy for him, I was resentful that I had better stats but didn't get into schools of similar caliber. I eventually committed to a top 20 school, but felt that I was above it, that I deserved and was entitled to better. Everyone congratulated me, and I outwardly thanked them, but I was still bitter. I would spend my free time on the College Confidential threads, getting mad at the people who got into Harvard or Princeton or wherever with "only" 34's on the ACT or 3.8 GPAs, thinking that they didn't deserve it. 

When I got to college in August, I pretty much isolated myself from everyone else. Every time I would pass by a black kid, or hispanic kid, or athlete, my mind would immediately switch to a sense of anger, mad that they supposedly only got in because of the advantages in the admissions process. I didn't bother to go to any of my classes because I figured I'm so much smarter than everyone here that I could beat the curve without even trying. I pretty much just stayed by myself in my dorm room all day wishing I was somewhere else.

It wasn't until the first midterm grades started coming in that I realized I was being ridiculous. I was under-performing on tests and hadn't been handing in any work. I realized that I needed to change and finally, 10 weeks into the semester, I went to the medical center and got therapy for my issues. I finally started to realize that I was lucky to be at a prestigious school (even if it's not the most prestigious), and started to put more effort into classes and developing relationships with other students. Now, during finals week, I've been going to class and hanging out with people in my dorm and doing normal college stuff. But I can't help feeling like I missed out on almost an entire semester of positive experiences (and GPA points) just because I was stubborn and entitled.


So please try not to be like me. If you don't get into your dream school, or even any of your top choice colleges, it's not an indictment on you as a person or even as a student. Remember the top colleges get many more applications than they have space for. All the time you hear of kids getting into Harvard and not Brown or MIT and not Carnegie Mellon. With the exception of maybe a few handfuls of truly brilliant and incredibly accomplished students, no one is going to get in everywhere. But as long as you continue to work hard, you'll end up somewhere good. Every college has smart and talented students. Maybe some more than others, but no matter where you go, if you work hard and rise to the top, you'll have the same opportunities as everyone else, whether it be for graduate school or jobs or anything else (except for maybe at Goldman Sachs but they're a bunch of pretentious babies anyway). Assuming you applied to a range of colleges where you'll be happy attending, you'll be fine wherever you go. Don't let a few rejections ruin the experience for you.
