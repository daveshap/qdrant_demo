Why does this guy keep asking my mom about me?!?
Sooo this is gonna sound so weird, but during the summer I was doing this internship program that my mom ran for her company and there were a whole bunch of guys there... obviously... anyway long story short there’s one who I’ve only met once for a brief moment and my mom was right there when we had our brief interaction... I ended up missing one day and this guy was asking my mom all kinds of questions about me.  He ended up calling my moms job and still does to ask about me.  He’s pretty hot but I guess my question is why won’t he just come and talk to me instead of asking my mom questions about me it’s kinda weird
