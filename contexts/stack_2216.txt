How to create a door which opens automatically for players but not for mobs? I would like to make a door that is easy to open by players, but  not mobs.Tried using a button to power the door but clicks are inaccurate while playing on laptop, rendering the door an obstacle, and also jump to activate a tripwire to power the door, but it just closes too quickly, rendering the door an obstacle again.An extra point is that no wooden doors as I am playing on hard difficulty and I am playing on survival so no commands, just redstone.So how can I solve this problem?
