I FREAKING GOT 73K FROM GEORGETOWN AS AN INTERNATIONAL
Aid award came out earlier today and GEORGETOWN GAVE ME 73K A YEAR!!! I literally applied the very last minute of the extended deadline by copy-pasting my common app essays. Getting in alone was such a shock, now itâ€™s like getting admitted the second time, especially given that Georgetown says their aid for intl student is extremely limited!

My fellow internationals, IT REALLY NEVER HURTS TO TRY!!

**Edit:** **Thank you all for your congrats!! I really appreciate it!**

**Edit 2:** Sorry, I wouldn't share my stats. I don't think it'll help anyone. My stats is well above average but I believe it wasn't what set my application apart. It's perhaps the case for most internationals, who are usually in a hella competitive pool as a result of self-selection. Once you've got good numbers, they don't matter that much anymore, so I don't want my stats to mislead other kids.
