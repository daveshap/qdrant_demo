KASTLE: I have someone for you to play with Junior.
JUNIOR: Someone wants to play with me?
KASTLE: I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
JUNIOR: Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
SID: Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
BREEZE: La da da dalala...
SID: I hate fuckin' opera.
BREEZE: How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
SID: How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
BREEZE: You listen to the feelings, not the words.
SID: You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
BREEZE: It was a clearance.
SID: You know, Elvis bowled.
BREEZE: No kiddin'.
SID: Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no
SID: gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
BREEZE: Sure, Sid.
SID: But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
BREEZE: - canker sore.
SID: Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
SID: How do you turn this thing off?
BREEZE: Wait! That's an aria!
