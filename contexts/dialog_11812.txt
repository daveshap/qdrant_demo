AGENT RAY: Now that's cool.
AGENT BOB: Cool?
AGENT RAY: Yeah, cool.
AGENT BOB: You think it's cool?

CEREAL: So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
DADE: What is it with this guy?
PHREAK: His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
CEREAL: Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
PHREAK: Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
DADE: Did you talk to him?
PHREAK: Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes. He isn't to consort with his computer friends. The secret service is really out to get him. Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
