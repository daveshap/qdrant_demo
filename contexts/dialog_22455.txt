MARY: Are we leaving?
CLAY: It's too light yet.
CLAY: Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
MARY: You're not going out to look for them?
CLAY: No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
STEVE: Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
MARY: Oh, I wasn't worrying. I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
