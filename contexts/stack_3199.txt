Don't remember a book: Merlin/Grey Side There was a book I've read a long time ago about someone related to Merlin or something and his travel to another world that was separated into 3 sides - grey, dark and light. He also could use an artifact that can do anything. The book name said something about Merlin and grey side, although I'm not sure about that. Can someone help me? This have been bugging me for a while now.I also remember some parts of the plot like the boy was in school and he was bullied (maybe?) but he was transported into the world by someone else and he changed his race? I also remember a vampire castle and vampire lions for some reason.Edit. If i am not mistaken, part of the story (the beginning) was set in modern (relatively) time.
