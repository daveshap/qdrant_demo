SAM: Are you sleeping?
NICOLE: No.
SAM: Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse. I thought I'd take you over.
NICOLE: Great.
SAM: You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess. Hard to talk to.
SAM: What do you mean?
NICOLE: I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star. Not like you used to tell me. Remember, Daddy? All the people that were going to discover me? Where are they now?
NICOLE: He couldn't look at me. But I looked at him. Right at him. His secret was mine now. We used to share it. But not anymore. Now, I owned it completely.
SAM: Well, okay. I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning. That's okay with you?
NICOLE: Great.
