MOTHERSHEAD: Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
TREVES: Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
MOTHERSHEAD: Won't come out, eh?
TREVES: No, he's very upset about something.
MOTHERSHEAD: Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
