DEBORAH: You lost my money?
LOMBARD: You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
DEBORAH: Who is Friedman?
LOMBARD: The man who sold the boy to your brother.
DEBORAH: I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
LOMBARD: Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:... Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I’m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
