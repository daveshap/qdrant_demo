Substance Free Housing Programs
Does anybody have any experience with Substance Free Housing Programs for Upper Class Students? What kind of programs and activities went on in this housing?

It's an interesting concept because these are students who are not necessarily teetotalers, but want to live in an environment that shouldn't alcohol/drugs/etc.
