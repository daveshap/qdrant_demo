ARNOLD: That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'. The man's a budding Cromwell. He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
WASHINGTON: Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
ARNOLD: They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits! It's becoming the American way!
WASHINGTON: You go too far, Benedict.
ARNOLD: These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
WASHINGTON: Cut those men down. Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial. Benedict, trust me to handle this.
WASHINGTON: Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
JOSEPH REED: The man is a traitor!
WASHINGTON: How can you say that?
