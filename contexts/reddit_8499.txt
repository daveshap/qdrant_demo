The Southern Strategy: Fact or Fiction and influence
Recently I was a part of a debate on the validity of the Southern Strategy. What it was, and whether it even existed as either a general program or just as a tactic used by some. Furthermore the role it played in the platform migrations of the Republican and Democratic Parties between 1940 and 2008.

For those not knowing what the Southern strategy is, I feel this wiki has the popular definition.

My Query: 
1. Does the Southern Strategy Exist

2. *If not/If so* what evidence is there.

3. *If so* was it a prominent tactic in the platform migration.

4. *If not* what instead played a prominent role in the platform migration.
