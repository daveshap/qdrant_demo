Five years since degree, two years unemployed. Any ideas for moving forward?
27 years old by now and my self confidence has never been lower. Been contemplating suicide several times and should've probably sought after therapy of some sorts, just to give you an idea of my mental state for the last couple of years.

Basically couldn't land a job after my bachelors degree due to lack of experience and poor social skills. Went to several interviews, but they always choose someone else. My lack of confidence is always leaking through my answers and me trying to straight up give a false impression will always fail so I've been mostly giving straight answers, even though it will sink me in the end. Keeping up a facade would be impossible for me as I'm an introvert and have a hard time with a severely damaged self image.

So since my degree I went back to my work full-time at a local industrial production company and worked there for 3 years. My boss would always complement me on helping out and working extra etc, whatever you could wish for as a reference to a next job in a new career.

But with time passing by and being stuck with a, to be honest, shitjob even tho I had a degree the field was "screaming for", my mental state straight up sank to levels I didn't know was possible. So I quit my job just to break the cycle. All it did was me ending up in a bubble and a far worse depression.

Now it's been 2 years and I don't know where to go from here. Should I forget my degree altogether or **have people come back from this at all?** The degree isn't bad, I'm the only one who couldn't get a job as far as I know, even people with worse grades etc. Study a new field? Tried that for a year, just thought it would end up as last time so I dropped the plans (plus the school was nothing like Univ.)
