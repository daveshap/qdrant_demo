DICKIE: Who's this?
RIPLEY: It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
DICKIE: Okay. And did we know each other?
RIPLEY: Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
DICKIE: Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog. This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
RIPLEY: Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
MARGE: How do you do.
DICKIE: What are you doing in Mongi?
RIPLEY: Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
DICKIE: Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
RIPLEY: It's just an undercoat.
DICKIE: Say again?
RIPLEY: You know, a primer.
DICKIE: That's funny.
MARGE: You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
DICKIE: Sure. Any time.
MARGE: And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
