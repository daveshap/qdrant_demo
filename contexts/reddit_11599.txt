My fiance found religion...
I'm an atheist and have been most of my life. When I originally met my fiance she was an atheist, which is one of the things that attracted me to her because we had a lot of things in common. Saying that, I'm not an atheist that's against religion. My entire family is religious and at certain family events everyone prays before a meal and I always bow my head and show respect. 

About three weeks ago my fiance asked me to attend church with her and her family. No big deal. We wanted to go. Well she has now found God and is completely changing her life around. Don't get me wrong, I'm very proud of her and respect her but I don't know how to handle the situation. I keep going to church with her and such but it's weird. I love her to death and would never leave her at this point but it kind of makes me sad that we don't have that one thing in common anymore and she's changing a little.

I probably seem like a huge asshole but can someone tell me if I'm being too judgmental? I love my fiance and I always will, I just need some advice on how to be more understanding and not feel any animosity towards her.
