Is no job training a red flag?
I had an interview with a company, and at the location I'm working at I will be the only person in that department. Everyone else on my "team" will be remote from other offices around the world. 

I asked about job training and there's technically someone who knows how to do this job at my location but the hiring manager danced around it and essentially said there would be no training period. The company is going through a merger and adapting old policies so I'm nervous it's going to be disorganized and chaotic.

Thoughts?
