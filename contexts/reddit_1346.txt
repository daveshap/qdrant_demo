Happy Valentineâ€™s Day. ALL OF YOU ARE LOVED!
Usually this day makes me super anxious and I avoid all social media because I started to realize I was getting upset over people being happy. I started to wane myself off of Facebook because it made my hands shaky and clammy. I was triggering myself by looking at old flames, exes dating new people, etc. 

Iâ€™ve come a long way from last year for sure. 

Make sure to love yourself today! 

Do something nice for yourself and know we are all supportive of each other ðŸ’•
