Planning a Suicide calms me.
Every time I get stressed and have an anxiety epsiode, my mind subconsciously plans a method to kill myself. 
And before I know it, 30 mins will be passed and I will be calm as a clam. I haven't gathered courage to attempt again but I sure have thought of every possible way and calculated the risks, amount of time it takes, availablity of such materials assisting suicide, effective time to attempt, etc etc. 

Everyday I drown a little more into the depth, I can't stop drowning, everytime I think this is little better, I drown 100 times more, it's like I can't even be at peace for 2 days then it hits me again. I am afraid of being 'happy' because I know the good deal of it is waiting for me. 
I can't talk to my friends, even though I made some through online, I can't openly talk to them or cry to them because i don't want them to drown with me in my depression. 

Hopefully I can somehow gain courage to atleast attempt a little one, may not be deadly but gotta start somewhere again. That's all I can be 'hopeful' for. 

Thank you for reading.
