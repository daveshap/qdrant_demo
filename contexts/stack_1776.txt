simulate a motor with resistor and inductor I want to simulate a motor with a resistor and inductor. It means I want to connect a resistor and inductor to 1-phase or 3-phase instead of a motor. For achieving this goal I have to measure both active and reactive power and calculate the value of resistor and inductor. Is it possible? I mean is it a right way to consume active and reactive power with resistor and inductor?And if it is right, how is the connection of resistor and inductor. Parallel or series?
