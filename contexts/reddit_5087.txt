Applying to a place more than once. Would you do it?
Have you/would you ever consider reapplying to a job you didn't get hired for the first time around? I've applied to a few companies/positions I've interviewed for already but didn't make the final cut, and am thinking of reapplying when the position reopens. What do you think is the likelihood you'd get the job a second time around?
