BUFF: Hey, we're just having a conversation.
NAZEER: This is private property, my friend.
TIM: Come on man.
BUFF: Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
NAZEER: Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
BUFF: We're your customers. We're not complaining.
NAZEER: Please!
JEFF: You don't need to sit next to me right now.
TIM: Who were you talking to?
JEFF: Nobody. Sooze.
BUFF: Stuck with what guy?
JEFF: What?
BUFF: You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
JEFF: No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
BUFF: It's your birthday?
JEFF: Yeah.
BUFF: Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
