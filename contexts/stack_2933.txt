How rotation of basis is possible in Heisenberg picture? Shouldn't it be fix? I was trying to understand Heisenberg picture. According to my understanding in this picture operators(position x(t) and momentum p(t)) change with time but basis (x,y,z coordinates) remain fix. I was trying to understand this concept by imaging a particle(p) in x,y plane. x and y are basis and vector that connects the origin of the plane with the particle p is state vector (R). Now according to Heisenberg picture operators change with time it means the the position of the particle P can vary with time but x and y remain fix.But in Shankar's book author has mentioned that \"in Heisenberg picture basis can rotate like state vectors. So in such basis,the vectors appear to be frozen.\"So according to the author x,y are moving but the particle P remains at the same position. Which is opposite to the Heisenberg picture. I'm really confused after reading this concept from Shankar's book. Can some one please explain where I am wrong?
