OWENS: Why did I fall on you?
FRY: He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
OWENS: I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
FRY: You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
OWENS: Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
