JACOB: Why are you so agitated?
SETH: I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
JACOB: He backed down.
SETH: He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear."
JACOB: What are you going to do?
SETH: I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
JACOB: Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
SETH: I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
JACOB: Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
SETH: What did you call me?
JACOB: Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won? The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
