I am addicted to the internet, and the useless social media
After long quarrels with family, I think I finally matured enough to realize I am truly addicted to the internet and social media, computers and games. I find it very disturbing and it's really hard to find an easy way out.

After reading a few relevant highly rated books I decided to quit Facebook.
And I wasn't even using mobile data, I just happened to be around and on Facebook since I arrived home and almost till I went to bed. I know this might sound ridiculous but it hasn't been 24hours and I'm starting to crave for information and the feed wall.
Sad thing though I know I am far from lonely with this problem, but others don't want to fight it.

I am trying my best at finding goals for me, setting up projects, work out time consuming plans, but whatever I've tried yet I still end up on the computer staring at reddit, scrolling stuff and answering people on Skype.
I feel like I spend so much time here, wasting my young life, while I could make use of my imagination somewhere, and working with my talents.
Any comments would be appreciated.
