Does anyone feel like the COVID-19 pandemic has set their careers back?

I'm not sure how to feel about this virus. I didn't lose my job thankfully, but most of my friends and family did. I was working towards a promotion and would have made a year prior to the state of affairs, but now with the grim reality that my job has received funding from the Paycheck Protection Program, I'm almost certain that my promotion is slipping away, as they can barely stay afloat.

While I am very grateful that I have a job still, my family does not, so I am the breadwinner in my household at the moment. It's a very scary feeling. I'm on all forms of government assistance, my housing complex provides food to low-income residents, and I'm applying to every form of monetary help I can. It all just seems so grim. 

All of my colleagues are able to find new jobs, with better pay, or higher job titles and all of the work I've done in my job so far seems trivial. All of the individuals with whom I've spoken to in passing, at the laundromat, at the coffee shop, front-desk receptionists, all seem so happy.

How can anyone be happy? I feel COVID-19 has ruined my chances at a real future. At a way to move up the corporate ladder. As a way to make a sustainable living. I'm a couple of years out of college, and as a millennial, had to deal with the dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial housing crisis, 9/11, and now this.   


Can I just not get a break? It almost just seems like it's not worth trying anymore. Even individuals on unemployment are receiving more then I am. 

Sorry for the rant, I just feel so helpless and hopeless and like my life is worthless and not going to be the same after this.
