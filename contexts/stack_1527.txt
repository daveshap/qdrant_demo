How to do IMU and camera \"sensor fusion\" tracking? I have some 50ms latency cameras on hand and an gyro+accelerometer+magnetometer 800Hz IMU. I would like to know how exactly I should do a sensor fusion of such an IMU and camera to fix the positional data from the IMU positional drift. I'm not able to find much resources online.Reason I don't want to go with just camera is the latency of 50ms with it.\u200bThe optical markers for the camera can be LEDs, ORB-SLAM data or AruCo markers which I currently use which add another few ms latency to the camera tracking.\u200bMaybe there is even an existing library or documented implementation I can use?\u200bThank you.
