ADELE: This is strange. Do you feel it?
LUKE: What?
ADELE: We've done this before, so many times. The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
LUKE: Oh.
ADELE: You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
LUKE: It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
ADELE: Nine hundred...
LUKE: Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
ADELE: What about a loan? You could go to the bank...?
LUKE: A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
ADELE: Well, there's got to be a way...
LUKE: Have you got a cigarette?
ADELE: When did you start smoking?
LUKE: I don't smoke?
ADELE: You tried to once. It was pretty pitiful.
LUKE: Oh.
LUKE: They're not bad.
ADELE: No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
LUKE: My what?
ADELE: Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet. You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder. So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
LUKE: Huh. That was nice of me.
ADELE: You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy. Bothered the hell out of you. But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
LUKE: ... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
ADELE: Exactly. And he got good.
LUKE: No kidding.
ADELE: Now, did you remember that, or...
LUKE: Nope. Just filling in the blanks.
ADELE: Oh. Okay.
