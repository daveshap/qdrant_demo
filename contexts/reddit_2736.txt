Considering leaving my position due solely to not having received a review or an increase - justifiable or petty?
So I started with this company in July of last year, and my offer was for an agreed starting salary, with a 90 day review. Normally, not having gotten a review by now wouldn’t be that big of a deal, except for the following:

I started on a Monday, and on Friday I was offered another position that was more in line with my background, and told that it would pay better as well. Of course I accepted, and after about 3 weeks I assumed the new role. 

Once in the new position, I was instrumental in literally saving the department from collapse, and it is now more profitable than its ever been. 

I was instrumental in helping collect over $35,000 from a client due to a past connection with them (I’m not in finance or collection, and through my connections was able to clear up some communication issues that got us paid quickly) 

At my 90 day mark, my manager was terminated. This has nothing to do with my specific department as he wore several hats, but it did require my partner and I to work more independently. We now manage our department with minimal supervision. 

I’ve also brought in two successful referrals, who are doing well. I’ve brought in guests to speak with management about opportunities to expand and strategies for making that successful. 

Normally, I wouldn’t be upset over not getting a raise within the first year, but I was told I would get a review, then offered a promotion which I have done a great job with...and no increase in pay... am I wrong for being pissed? I’ve mentioned it a couple times but I’m done beating a dead horse. Is it wrong of me to be looking just because of this? It feels very much like a broken promise, about money as well as recognition. I’m frustrated. Sorry for the rant.
