MACFARLANE: Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once. But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
MRS. MARSH: But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
MACFARLANE: I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
MRS. MARSH: There's nothing I can say for one small child?
MACFARLANE: I'm not heartless, Ma'am. I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
FETTES: I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
MACFARLANE: You're made for a doctor, young man!
FETTES: I'm afraid I have to, sir. You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
MACFARLANE: You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit. I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
FETTES: I thought only the best students were made assistants.
MACFARLANE: Well? And are you not a good student?
FETTES: But Richardson?
MACFARLANE: Richardson is a fine student. He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes. Come along now --
