This is driving me crazy. All posts, no matter what context, should include what state, province, or country you're from.
Looking for advice? Tell us where you're from.
Having a tough time in your market? Tell us where you are.
Complaining about your employer? Maybe we can sympathize so tell us where you're redditing from.

I think this is common sense and it's driving me a bit crazy.
