If enough people upvote this (>500) then I will submit this terrible Dartmouth rap
Dartmouth ain’t no fart-mouth, feeling over like a cart-house by a cat’s snout. 

Dartmouth you ain’t falling love now, don’t boot me out your club now

Dartmouth you are the one now 

Green trees, full of weeds, leaves

Dartmouth, I’m out of control now

You’re the pearl in my reef

My love for you knows no bounds

Dartmouth you make me blubber and fib

You make my stubble stiff

Your D-Plan makes me intellectually active

Give me freedom, don’t give me fake

Give me love now, don’t give me hate

Dartmouth press that accept button

I love you
