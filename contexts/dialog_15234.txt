TELLY: I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
CASPER: To what? Virgins?
TELLY: Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
CASPER: What do you mean?
TELLY: I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
CASPER: You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
TELLY: That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
CASPER: She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
TELLY: I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
CASPER: Did you tell her that you loved her?
TELLY: Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
CASPER: Shit.
TELLY: What do you want?
CASPER: Get another forty. Smoke a blunt.
TELLY: Are you hungry?
CASPER: Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
TELLY: You wanna go to Paul's house?
CASPER: What for? That guys a dick.
TELLY: I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
CASPER: You think he's got any herb?
TELLY: I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
CASPER: You think?
TELLY: Probably.
CASPER: He lives on 76th?
TELLY: 78th.
CASPER: Den less go Joe.
CASPER: Telly.
TELLY: Yeah.
CASPER: Did she suck your dick?
TELLY: A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
CASPER: Why?
TELLY: I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
CASPER: It is right.
TELLY: I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
CASPER: It's no big deal, right?
TELLY: Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
CASPER: Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is. It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
TELLY: Yep.
CASPER: They're gonna tell their grand kids. That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
TELLY: You thirsty?
CASPER: Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
TELLY: You got any money?
CASPER: Three pennies and a ball of lint.
TELLY: You down with the boost?
CASPER: Unzip my pack, yo.
TELLY: Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
KOREAN STORE OWNER: Whah?
TELLY: Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
KOREAN STORE OWNER: Whah is dissdee?
TELLY: Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
KOREAN STORE OWNER: I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
TELLY: I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
KOREAN STORE OWNER: Whah you say? Dissdee?
