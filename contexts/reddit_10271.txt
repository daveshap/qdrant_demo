Can we not gatekeep suicidal depression?
Hello. I had an interesting conversation with another redditor the other day from my post. I was gonna attempt and this person tried to talk me down, only to get agitated at me and say,” you’re only attention seeking and wasting good people’s time.” Like isn’t the point of this subreddit to be a bit attention seeking? I wanted someone to talk me out of it. But don’t tell me that I’m not suicidally depressed, you don’t fucking know me and what I’m going through. You shouldn’t have that attitude if you’re trying to help people on here. Thank you all, I hope you have a good day.
