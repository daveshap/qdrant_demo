BUD: A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
GEKKO: ...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
BUD: There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
GEKKO: How do you know?
BUD: I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
OLLIE: ... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
GEKKO: Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
OLLIE: And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.

BUD: My home number's on the back...
GEKKO: Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
