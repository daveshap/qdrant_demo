QUAID: Who?
LORI: The brunette. The one you told me about.
QUAID: Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
LORI: Who is she?
QUAID: Nobody.
LORI: Nobody?! What's her name?
QUAID: I don't know.
LORI: Tell me!
LORI: It's not funny, Doug. You dream about her every night.
QUAID: But I'm always home by morning.
LORI: Let me go!
QUAID: Aw, come on, baby...You're the girl of my dreams.
LORI: ...You mean it?
QUAID: You know I do.
