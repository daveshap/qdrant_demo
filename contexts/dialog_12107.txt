WENDY: Hey.
WICHITA: Hey--that coffee? You're a goddess. Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk about?
WENDY: Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
WICHITA: Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
WENDY: We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
WICHITA: Yes you do.
WENDY: Yeah. I guess I do.
WICHITA: Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
WENDY: Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
WICHITA: I think your passion is terrific.
WENDY: I think your condescension is even better.
WICHITA: We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
WENDY: Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
WICHITA: You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
WENDY: Do you really not believe in God?
WICHITA: It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
WENDY: What else don't you believe in?
WICHITA: Talking while kissing.
