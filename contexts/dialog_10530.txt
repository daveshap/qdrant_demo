KAREN: Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
HARRY: He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
CHILI: Is he giving you a check or cash?
HARRY: Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
KAREN: A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
CHILI: The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
