My advisor has pushed me in the wrong direction
First: thanks for being great students and ppl! Remember that school is temporary and there is a lot more to our worth than grad school

Second: fuck this place. I'm in my fourth year and my advisor has forced me onto a project for 3 years now.  The initial project was expected to only take a year. This methodology paper has turned into a total synthesis and the story doesn't even make sense any more. This will likely go into my dissertation but it won't be a chapter in-and-of its self. I have two other projects that are more promising, one of which could potentially change our whole synthetic path. I'm getting irritated and disheartened when talking to him about how we need to change our approach.
