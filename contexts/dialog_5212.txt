RENAULT: As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
RICK: Yeah? Why?
RENAULT: Why do you interfere with my little romances?
RICK: Put it down as a gesture to love.
RENAULT: Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
LASZLO: Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
RICK: Go ahead.
LASZLO: Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
RICK: My office.
LASZLO: Right.
LASZLO: You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
RICK: I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
LASZLO: My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
RICK: What of it?
LASZLO: Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
RICK: Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
LASZLO: Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
RICK: I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
LASZLO: I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
RICK: My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
LASZLO: There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
RICK: There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
LASZLO: I beg your pardon?
RICK: I said, ask your wife.
LASZLO: My wife?
