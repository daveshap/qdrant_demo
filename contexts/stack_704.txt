Can't mount NTFS partitions, and don't have Windows installed to fix them I've just installed 16.04. Ubuntu. I installed it on old C:/ partition (250GB SSD disk, all place for Linux, ext4) so I don't have dual-boot and I am not able to boot Windows because it doesn't exist on any of my disks. I also have two HDD disks (750GB - 2 NTFS partition 250 and 500, 250 GB - one NTFS partition). My problem is that I can't mount these disks with write and read permission. Later I couldn't mount the disks at all due to an error about hibernated Windows (which I don't have). I used the program Disk (preinstalled) and added 'ro' to the mount options. It helped with mounting the disk, but I can't write or edit anything. Can you help?
