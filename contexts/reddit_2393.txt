It’s no longer enough to do your job, but you have to be above and beyond to keep it?
I’m not sure if this is mostly a startup thing, but I just find those roles are generally more open. I had an interview with a non startup recently who also adopts this mentality so I’m scared to even proceed in the process.

The past few jobs I’ve had, I would start and do pretty well, but then my responsibilities would grow and I can’t handle it. I’ve been let go twice for not being “up to par” with what they want. It kills me they rather have no one in the spot than me doing an average job. Average is no longer enough. You can’t just do your job, you have to constantly wow everyone. 

Is this normal for most companies these days? How can I find a company I can feel safe at? I’m doing my best. Everyone knows I’m not lazy.
