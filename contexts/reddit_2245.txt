WE’VE GOT THIS
You read the title. We’ve all worked so hard for the last three years and just have to complete the final sprint for the next few months. Yes, all of the stress can be daunting and horrible at times— but just remember: in the future, when this is all over, you will be able to look back with a smile of satisfaction, knowing that you gave it your all. WE’VE GOT THIS, CLASS OF 2020!!!!
