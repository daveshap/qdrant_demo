JOCKO: Man, you won't like that back seat.
FRANKIE: Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
JOCKO: Hell, they're all after the same thing.
POP: Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
JOCKO: What d'you know about women, Pop?
POP: Well, I got married to one of them.
JOCKO: Hell, I didn't know you was married.
POP: Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
JOCKO: Is that right? Think you're gonna make it with her?
FRANKIE: Just get her drunk.
DUFF: How 'bout the key?
FRANKIE: I bet she's easy jam.
