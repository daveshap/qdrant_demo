DELLA: Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
JACOB: No, thanks.
DELLA: It's fun.
ELSA: You have an unusual hand.
JACOB: I could have told you that.
ELSA: You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
ELSA: You know, you got a strange line here.
JACOB: It's short, huh?
ELSA: Short? It's ended.
JACOB: Oh, terrific.
ELSA: It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
JACOB: Just my luck.
