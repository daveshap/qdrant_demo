How can I find a job that doesn’t treat me like garbage?
I (28F) cannot remember the last time a job did not treat me like garbage. For 5 years now I have worked in many different jobs where I have been bullied by adults/superiors. 

This mostly occurred when I was a teacher being treated poorly by admin and parents. But now I am an office manager at a school  and the director treats me like the “uneducated  help”. Mind you I have my masters and only took this job to escape the garbage treatment at my last job. 

I am very good at my job. According to everyone. But this director just speaks down to people and is so scatterbrained and incompetent herself. She speaks down to everyone. 

I’m ready to move on. HOWEVER after spending so long being treated like shit and going to a new place and being treated like shit and having this cycle repeat itself over and over, I feel so scared. Like why do I keep being treated so terribly by people on power trips? 

How do I avoid it? Is it possible? Is there a career out there that DOESNT treat people like shit?

I’m not looking for royal treatment. Just not to be talked down to and bullied and treated like a moron.
