I get embarrassed when doing my hobbies around family members.
Whenever I am home and working on my hobbies I tend to feel embarrassed. My main hobby right now is medieval reenactment. Recently I've been working on making armour for combat. 

My grandmother lives with me and my father visits recently. Whenever she or my father sees me working on anything (not just this hobby) they tend to look at me tilt and ask "what are you doing" in a tone that, to me, implies I'm doing something strange. 

They don't ever discuss my hobbies with me directly. They have a tendency to ask my brother questions about my interests. So, if it ever gets brought up, I feel really embarrassed talking about my interest and hobbies. 

How can I relax and just get on with my business without feeling like a weirdo? I have to sneak around whenever I'm working on stuff and it's really stressful, especially when I'm trying to do something I enjoy.
