My Life is Completely Consumed by School and I Hate It
Hey. I’m a freshmen in high school, and my life has been really frustrating recently. So, in class, I take all tough classes and I do band. The problem comes with not the classes themselves, but with the homework. It’s taking over my life, and it’s not even been a month. In class, I get stacks of homework. Stacks. But fine, lots of homework is manageable, I can deal with it. But I also have band. Now, our band is super rigorous. We go to after school practice every day for 3 hours - about. And let me tell you, three hours is a lot. But then I have homework to do, my stacks of homework. By the end of the day, it’s 2:00 AM and I’ve finally finished everything I need to do and I can sleep. But... it’s so hard. I can’t do anything other than school. I get ready for school in the morning, I go to school, I do band, I go home and do homework until WELL past 12:00 until he next day.  Even my weekends. My weekends can be just as saturated with homework, AND IT SUCKS. It’s too much for me to handle but it’s too late for me to drop out of band and I’m too scared of loosing opportunities when I’m older by not doing the tough courses. I feel so trapped and angry. It gets so unmotivating and tiring, and I feel so helpless. I don’t know what to do and I don’t know how to cope with this. I need advise.
