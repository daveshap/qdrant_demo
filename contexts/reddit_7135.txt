One of those days. Need to rant.
(Posted under throwaway account because reasons.)

I got a job at a startup about (6) months ago after the company I worked for previously shut down. Long story, but the job seemed like a good opportunity to help grow the marketing agency, even though my pay was literally cut in half. I was the 2nd employee, so the first few months I spent working with just the founder and myself in the office.

We clicked immediately upon meeting for the first time. We have very similar personalities, and I was inspired by her motivation and vision for the business. Anyway, a major Catch-22 to working for someone so similar to yourself is that you're not *actually* working for yourself - so the autonomy that I cherished in previous positions has all but disappeared. Although I hold a Management level position (pointless because there's no staff to manage).....EVERYTHING has to be approved by the founder. I'm feeling micro-managed.

I find myself disagreeing more and more with decisions the founder is making and the direction she's moving the business. At the same time, this is my 3rd job within 4 years (various reasons) - I've already applied for other positions within my industry and have faced this obstacle.

*I'm feeling stuck.* I should be grateful for this opportunity, and I am, but working for a Type-A control freak clone of yourself just sucks, man. Thanks for reading.
