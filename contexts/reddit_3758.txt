So confused...are people still visiting their date’s place during this quarantine? What’s the general advice?
I’ve been holding off on visiting someone I started dating right before the quarantine, as I’m trying to be extra cautious right now. However, my roommate has still been bringing over her SO to our place every now and then throughout all of this. I think her SO lives with roommates too, so this has all been making me a bit uneasy. Am I right to ask that he not come over for a while, or are many people still doing this? I’m trying to keep my distance either way. I’m in the U.S., west coast.
