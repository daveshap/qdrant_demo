KATE: Why're you driving so fast?
BANDIT: I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
KATE: Why? You have a bowling date?
BANDIT: Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
KATE: Who'd want to?
BANDIT: I never looked at it that way. You ask a lot of questions.
KATE: Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
BANDIT: For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
KATE: A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
BANDIT: It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
KATE: But you could get killed, right?
BANDIT: Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
KATE: An existentialist.
BANDIT: A what?
KATE: Eyes on the road.
KATE: So tell me about yourself.
BANDIT: Okay.
KATE: Well?...
BANDIT: Whaddya want to know? My sign?
KATE: No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
BANDIT: Having fun.
KATE: Is this fun?
BANDIT: Driving?
KATE: Driving, talking to me...
BANDIT: They're both a challenge.
KATE: You have a great profile.
BANDIT: Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
KATE: Where you from?
BANDIT: Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
KATE: Seriously?!?
BANDIT: Would I lie to you?
KATE: Guess what?
BANDIT: I give up.
KATE: You just passed your nemesis.
