Assistantships in higher ed
Hey, yâ€™all!
I was accepted into my dream school and program, and applied for half of the assistantship positions available. 
My question is this: what do I do if I cannot secure an assistantship on preview day? Also, did I not apply to enough?
Thanks!

ETA: assistantships are a program requirement
