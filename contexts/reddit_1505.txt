I can't believe it but I'm actually certified in Python!!
A few weeks back I had enrolled for a sort of speedy python corse. I am not a computers guy and have a completely different specialization. Math was never my strong suite. 

If this stumbling stressed and anxious mess of a person could do something like this so can you.

Edit 1- you can find the course here https://letsupgrade.in/fcs

I didn't want to seem too much like a telemarketer and I had dmed people about the course. But everyone was interested.

Edit 2- Wow my first post in Hot. You guys are amazing
