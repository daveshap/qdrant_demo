ELLIE: ... Just call me when you have it. Ike, how is the story coming? Is she a man-eater?

ELLIE: Fisher, let him talk.
IKE: But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all. Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her. And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
