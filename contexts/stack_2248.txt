My account reset? So first of all, I made my own steam account back in 2016 and I purchased a game called \"Arma 2\"...I had no trouble playing this game on my laptop that I made the account with and brought the games with also.But, unfortunately  I had broken that laptop as it fell on my wooden floor  by accident and I tried taking it to the shop they told me that they couldn't fix it, so I brought an mac computer and I tried logging back in and it went through the code process and email verification but when I logged in and checked my games it was empty...So I searched up the game I brought and I was hoping that I wouldn't have to buy it again but I clicked on the game and It said I have to buy it again??? I also brought an game on this mac that was not compatible with this computer so I have gotten it refunded, just wanted to know if that was the problem???Please help as I really don't want to purchase all the games again!
