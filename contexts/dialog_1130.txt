MOZART: Oh, thank you.
JOSEPH: The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
MOZART: Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
JOSEPH: And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
SALIERI: Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
MOZART: I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
SALIERI: Really?
MOZART: Mio caro Adone.
SALIERI: Ah!
MOZART: A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
JOSEPH: And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
MOZART: Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
SALIERI: My pleasure.
JOSEPH: Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
MOZART: Majesty!
JOSEPH: Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG: Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
VON STRACK: Did we?
VON SWIETEN: I don't think it was really decided, Director.
MOZART: Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
JOSEPH: Why so?
MOZART: Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
ORSINI-ROSENBERG: Oh? Have I seen it?
MOZART: I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG: I think you'd better.
JOSEPH: Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
MOZART: It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the whole thing is set in a - in a -
JOSEPH: Yes, where?
MOZART: In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
JOSEPH: Ah-ha.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG: You mean in Turkey?
MOZART: Exactly.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG: Then why especially does it have to be in German?
MOZART: Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
VON SWIETEN: My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
MOZART: Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent! It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
JOSEPH: Well, I'm glad to hear that.
SALIERI: Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
JOSEPH: Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
MOZART: Love, Sire!
SALIERI: Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
