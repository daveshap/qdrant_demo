She’s gone and so will I soon
She left today for the army, she’ll be gone a long time for training and then she’ll be gone another 2 years on top of that for her actual job. We had known each other for coming up on to two years and she was the only thing keeping me sane. Those late nights when I was on the verge of suicide she would call me and calm me down until I would fall asleep on the phone with her. Whenever I was feeling extra down she always knew what to say to make me smile. I would’ve been dead a long time ago without her and now that she’s gone I know I won’t make it more than a week. She was the only thing keeping me here and now that she’s gone I know this depression and anxiety are going to get the best of me. I just want to apologize to her for not being strong enough to make it through.
