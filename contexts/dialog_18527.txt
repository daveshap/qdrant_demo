PONSONBY: Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it. The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever. As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five. No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock. You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
BROWN: How will I know?
PONSONBY: I'm sorry?
BROWN: How will I know what she requires?
PONSONBY: You'll be sent a message.
BROWN: Who'll bring it to me?
PONSONBY: Her Highness' Equerry.
BROWN: I need a man who knows where I am.
PONSONBY: I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
BROWN: That's not good enough.
PONSONBY: Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
BROWN: Aye, do.
PONSONBY: There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries. No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
BROWN: I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
PONSONBY: In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
BROWN: Do you?
PONSONBY: Yes. I do.
