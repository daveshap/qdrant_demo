CINDY: Father!
MCFEELY: My child, you're alive!
CINDY: Yes, we made it!
MCFEELY: We? What do you mean... we?
CINDY: Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
MCFEELY: My child you are the only survivor.
CINDY: No, my friends are right here!
MCFEELY: I'm sorry.
CINDY: Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
MCFEELY: Soon, but first I must bless this house.

DWIGHT: I guess so.
