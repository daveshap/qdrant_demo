Anyone else finding that growing up in p intense poverty is messing you up as an adult?
For background, I'm from a family where we would genuinely count ourselves lucky to have a retail or cleaning job - I've had both and was very proud of them. None of my siblings have ever had a job and my parents became unemployed around the 90s, so I never saw them work. I am constantly extremely anxious about money and savings and terrified of somehow losing it or finding out there's a massive loan I have to pay that I don't know about. Nobody at my current job seems to have this relationship with cash and I don't understand it.
