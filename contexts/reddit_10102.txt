Looking to get into Res Life/ Student services, advice?
I worked as an RA for 3 years at a pretty top tier school in Canada, graduated, worked in customer service and then at an exec recruitment firm but want to get back into Res Life (RLC/ RLM).

I've applied to about 20 different jobs, some through old colleagues, and haven't heard anything back. Any advice for getting my foot in the door? Any things I should be highlighting on my resume? 

Literally any help is great, I know it's too late in the year now but things sometimes pop up and I want to be prepared for next hiring rounds in April/May
