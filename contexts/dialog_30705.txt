HEATHER: Yes?
SARA: Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line. How are you?
HEATHER: Oh, hi. I'm fine, Sara. My God, a voice from the past!
SARA: Really! Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time. It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
HEATHER: Uh...sure...when?
SARA: No time like the present. The car will bring you.
HEATHER: Now?
SARA: Just take a minute. You'll be glad you did, I bet.
