CHARLIE: ...Your room does that too?
BARTON: I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
CHARLIE: What a dump...
CHARLIE: ...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
BARTON: Well...
CHARLIE: Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
BARTON: What do you mean?
CHARLIE: This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
BARTON: Well, I guess you pick your poison.
CHARLIE: So they say.
BARTON: Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
CHARLIE: Course not, compadre. You'll see me again.
