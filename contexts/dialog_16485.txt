BILL: Have you made any charges against him?
WARDEN: No.
BILL: Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
WARDEN: All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later. For now, he's free to leave.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON: You just gonna let him go?
WARDEN: We'll get a tail put on him.
BILL: Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
CLAIRE: Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
PETE: No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
CLAIRE: Coming up.
