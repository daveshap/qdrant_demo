What are Hotels on Salt Lake City Trax Light Rail? Going to SLC in late Feb for snowboarding. Looking at staying in Murray, downtown and South Salt Lake so closer to resorts (Alta, Brighton, etc).How do I find out what hotels are walkable to light rail stops?What is it like taking light rail/bus in winter conditions (with stroller)?Are rail stations at grade? any escalators or stairs?Or...Are we better off renting car to get around Salt Lake City?
