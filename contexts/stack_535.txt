How do I connect my domain to my local Ubuntu Server? I already have purchased a domain and set up a local server now it's just linking them.I also have it configured so it uses a local IP 10.0.0.174, will I need to do anything else to change this so the registrar can link to a public one and how? What are the steps I should take? This is my first time hosting a website by myself. Also, any tips maybe?
