I can't believe what i recently experienced on tinder
This was a while ago, since i met him on tinder and dont use it anymore. 
First i chatted with him nicely for about a week. After that he really made some exceptional and weird demands and remarks to me. And that is why i at a certain point stopped any contact with him.
Basically this is what he wanted. He wanted to date but i have to go to his town and take the train because his car was in the garage. He didnt want to come to me/my town because for him it was 30/45 minutes walking to the train station and otherwise he would have to take the bus that don't run that often in his area. 

He wanted a guarantee we would have sex on the first date. 
Then when I explained i wouldn't do that (of course) he said that he can fuck any of his fwb's any day of the week, so it would have to be a yes please for me or a no (i guess he expected me to feel lucky or thankfull or something).

And he made this comment i was quite average looking of all the women he had dated/had sex with.

After all this i stopped any contact with him but then he messaged me again this week if i want to fuck. 
I mean how weird and unrealistic are his expectations????

Edit; 
The first week he showed normal behaviour and was a nice guy. When it came to meeting he said all tbat stuff. For a little while i kept talking to him because i was really suprised since i didn't expect thjs. I soon blocked his number after his remarks became crazier and crazier. I think him mentioning i was just average compared to the women he had slept with, was actually just slightly before i turned him down for a date, not after,funnily enough. 
He approached me on social media this week,saying he was horny and if i wanted to fuck. He could easily find me i think because we had a mutual friend on fb.
