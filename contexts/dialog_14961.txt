LEAH: Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
JUNO: I am a suicide risk.
LEAH: Is this Juno?
JUNO: No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
LEAH: Only the one in my pants.
JUNO: Dude, I'm pregnant.
LEAH: Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
JUNO: It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
LEAH: How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
JUNO: I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
LEAH: Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
JUNO: Unfortunately, yes.
LEAH: Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
JUNO: That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
LEAH: Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
JUNO: I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
LEAH: Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
JUNO: Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
LEAH: Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
JUNO: That is sick, man.
LEAH: So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
JUNO: Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
LEAH: When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
JUNO: Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
LEAH: Aha! You love him.
JUNO: It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
LEAH: So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
JUNO: It was magnificent, man!
JUNO: Hey Bleek.
BLEEKER: Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
JUNO: Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
BLEEKER: Cool.
JUNO: Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
BLEEKER: My mom uses color-safe bleach.
JUNO: Go Carole. So, guess what?
BLEEKER: I don't know...
JUNO: I'm pregnant.
