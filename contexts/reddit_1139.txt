Hey YOU
Yes. YOU. The person reading this right now. You're amazing. I'm telling you because you probably don't hear it as much as you deserve to. Because you're battling some really tough things that most people won't ever understand. Because even though you're doing that, and it's hell, you're STILL HERE. I don't know if you realize what a major accomplishment that is, but I'm here to tell you, it's fucking incredible. You're INCREDIBLE. Keep fighting. Keep going. It's going to be okay. I know it doesn't feel like it sometimes (or a lot of the time), but it really will. You're going to have glorious moments of sunshine to make all this rain worth it. Those moments are going to see you through the storms. Because there will be storms. Maybe you're in the storm right now. You'll get through it. Because you're strong, stronger than you think you are. You're incredible and strong, and I know you can do it. I have faith in you. I'm here for you. 
YOU. ARE. AMAZING.
