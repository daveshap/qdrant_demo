QUAID: What do you want?
EDGEMAR: This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
QUAID: I'm listening.
EDGEMAR: I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
QUAID: Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
EDGEMAR: I'm quite serious. You're not here, and neither am I.
QUAID: Amazing. Where are we?
EDGEMAR: At Rekall.
EDGEMAR: You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
QUAID: Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming! And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
EDGEMAR: Not exactly. What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes. But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
QUAID: Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
EDGEMAR: I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure. I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
QUAID: How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
EDGEMAR: Think about it. Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday. And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
QUAID: Bullshit. It's all coincidence.
EDGEMAR: What about the girl? Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified. Is that a coincidence?
QUAID: She's real. I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
EDGEMAR: Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? She's real because you dreamed her?""
QUAID: That's right.
