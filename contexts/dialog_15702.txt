CLARICE: Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
MR. YOW: Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
CLARICE: Good idea.
MR. YOW: Okay, Miss Starling?
CLARICE: Okay, Mr. Yow...
MR. YOW: You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
CLARICE: That wasn't me.
MR. YOW: Oh.
CLARICE: Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
MR. YOW: Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
CLARICE: Not yet! - just wait for me. Maybe in about two seconds.
