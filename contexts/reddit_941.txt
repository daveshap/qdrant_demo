Anyone else take their headphones off their heads every 5 seconds to make sure they're not loud and someone else is hearing them?
And feel like the person next to you is annoyed by the loud music but choosing not to tell you to turn it down?

Edit: omg guys
I'm fairly new to reddit so this is exciting for me! I'm not actually diagnosed with anxiety, but I still feel anxious and think the thoughts most of you think. So thank you for so many upvotes! I did not expect this! 😁😁🤗🤗
