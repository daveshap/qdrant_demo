How is Russia able to take those Ukrainian ships with The UN Law of the Sea and The Kerch Strait Agreement in place?
On 25 November 2018 three Ukrainian Navy vessels (two gun boats and an accompanying tug boat) were attempting passage from the Black Sea through the Strait of Kerch and into the Sea of Azov. 

Prior to entering the Strait, Russian FSB border security vessels intercepted the group off the coast of Crimea, ultimately capturing the vessels and their crew- which are being held in Kerch.  

Russia asserts that their actions were permissible as the ships had illegally entered Russian territorial waters; however, coordinates offered in statements by both Ukraine and Russia indicate that the encounter occurred in international waters.  

The event has prompted Ukraine to enact martial law in border regions and restricted the entry of Russian men aged 16-60  for fear of civil unrest similar to the events  in 2014 that stemmed from Euromaidan.  


The Kerch Strait Agreement defines the strait and Sea of Azov as historically shared waters and provide for shared use by both parties and the UN Law of the Sea contains provisions for innocent passage.  

What arguments could be made for or against the actions that took place?
