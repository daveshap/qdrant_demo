HAL: I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
BOWMAN: Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
HAL: I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
BOWMAN: Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
