HELEN: They put Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
M.J.: He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
HELEN: What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ! Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button. Just give me a minute here. The letter is addressed to me... You don't feel fear, do you? You're young. You feel like you'll live forever. How wonderful.
M.J.: I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
HELEN: They weren't going to show it to me?! The arrogance! It's my <u>life</u>!
M.J.: It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan. You can't run away from it anymore. Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work. Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler. And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end? And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details. Injecting Windex. Using .44. Playing Abba.
HELEN: It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
