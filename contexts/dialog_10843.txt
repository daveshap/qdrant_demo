VENKMAN: Excuse me for a minute. Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here. Can you come back in about an hour?
STANTZ: Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition. It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away. Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
VENKMAN: Sure. That's great, Ray. I think you should get down there right away and check it out. Let me know what happens.
STANTZ: No, this one's for real, Peter. Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale. Buried the needle. We're close this time. I can feel it.
VENKMAN: Okay. Just give me a second here. I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
COED: Eight o'clock?
VENKMAN: I was just going to say eight." You're fantastic!"
STANTZ: Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years. The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
VENKMAN: Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff. You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience. And what have you seen?
STANTZ: What do you mean by seen?""
VENKMAN: Looked at with your eyes.
STANTZ: Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
VENKMAN: Uh-huh. I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
