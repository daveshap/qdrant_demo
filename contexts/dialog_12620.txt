ROB: Are you still in love with me?
LAURA: Jesus. I do not know. I'll talk to you later.
ROB: Think about what I said. I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
LAURA: I'm not experimenting. Why don't you go experiment.
ROB: I don't want to. Don't need to. I love you.
LAURA: You don't ever think about other people?
ROB: No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
IAN: Laura? Are you okay?
LAURA: I am fine... I gotta go. Goodbye.
