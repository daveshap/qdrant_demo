ELLIS: What am I, a method actor? Hans, babe, put away the gun. This is radio, not television...
MCCLANE: That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him! I hate his fucking guts -- -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
ELLIS: John, how can you say that, after all these years--? John? John?
HANS: Hear that? Talk to me, where are my detonators. Where are they or shall I shoot another one? Sooner or later... ...I might get to someone you do care about.
MCCLANE: Go fuck yourself.
ROBINSON: Goddamn, didn't you hear him! He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
POWELL: Christ, can't you read between the lines! He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
ROBINSON: Maybe. And maybe they'd at least be talking to us! Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
POWELL: He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
ROBINSON: Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed.
