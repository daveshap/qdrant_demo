How can I prove I deserve more hours?
I’ve gotten my hours slashed at Chick-fil-A for no other reason than “slow business”. I’ve been getting shitty 10 hour weeks. I have coworkers back me up saying I don’t deserve low hours and that I’m consistent and should get more. I’ve already tried complaining to the manager but I got nowhere. I might need to try again. Advice?
