FRANK: You haven't seen Susie, have you?
JACK: No. Why?
FRANK: Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her. Makes me nervous.
JACK: She's a big girl.
FRANK: Yeah, well, she's our girl now. I think we better keep an eye on her. There's trouble there. Hey, listen to this. Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years. You believe that?
JACK: What the hell are these?
FRANK: Dedications. I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room. The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it. Daniels went crazy for the idea. And that's not all. Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability. Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
