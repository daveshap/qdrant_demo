MOTHER MIRIAM: Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
AGNES: Yes Mother.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why?
AGNES: In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
MOTHER MIRIAM: We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
AGNES: It made them holy.
MOTHER MIRIAM: It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets? Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
AGNES: No.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
AGNES: I burnt them.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why?
AGNES: They were stained.
MOTHER MIRIAM: How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
AGNES: Yes, Mother.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Say it!
