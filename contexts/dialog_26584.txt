MACKELWAY: I haven't changed anything. Damn.
KULOK: I...
MACKELWAY: I've got to take a piss.
MACKELWAY: Jaime --
KULOK: It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
MACKELWAY: Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
KULOK: How are we going to find him?
MACKELWAY: Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates, three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe, let it crunch this information.
FOREMAN: There seems to be a discrepancy.
ZERO: Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
FOREMAN: I have 6 tons.
ZERO: Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
FOREMAN: You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
ZERO: It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
FOREMAN: Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
ZERO: Not as much as you'd think.
