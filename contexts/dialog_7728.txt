TERRY: I'm a mirror.
COLLEEN: Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
TERRY: We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
COLLEEN: That's right.
TERRY: Okay?
COLLEEN: Mm-hm.
