JEFFREY: That oughta do it.
DOROTHY: Yeah.
SANDY: Are you alright?
JEFFREY: Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
SANDY: I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
JEFFREY: Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
SANDY: No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
JEFFREY: I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key. Pretty nifty, huh?
SANDY: Yeah, if it opens the door.
JEFFREY: Yeah.
