Making Mistakes Months into a Job
I'm a bit frustrated with myself. I switched from teaching into technical writing, and I am still making tiny mistakes. I'll forget to change the date, or something else like that. I've been at this job for six months, and I'm still overlooking these things, even though I check my work multiple times after finishing it. Though my actual writing is good, I can't stop beating myself up over this issue. My boss is very sweet, kind, and patient - the kind of person that you want to work hard for, but I'm tired of feeling like I'm letting her down. On top of that, I got fired from a brief job I had a while ago because I made a costly mistake. I can't help but feel this threat of being fired for my mistakes looming overhead, even though my boss has been nothing but forgiving and patient of me. 

Any advice or tips to help me keep my job and stop making these mistakes? Thanks.
