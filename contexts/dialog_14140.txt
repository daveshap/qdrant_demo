PETER: This looks like the best spot.
ELLIE: We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
PETER: I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
ELLIE: Peter—
PETER: What?
ELLIE'S VOICE: I'm hungry.
PETER: Just your imagination.
ELLIE: No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
PETER'S VOICE: You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
ELLIE: Well, I am.
PETER: If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
ELLIE: Not if you're more hungry than scared.
PETER: All right. You win. Let's forget it.
ELLIE: I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
PETER: Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
