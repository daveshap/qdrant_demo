KLAATU: Did all these people die in wars?
BOBBY: Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
KLAATU: No -- I'm afraid not.
BOBBY: Mr. Carpenter -- you don't seem to know about anything."
KLAATU: I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
BOBBY: Is it different where you've been? Don't they have places like this?
KLAATU: They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
