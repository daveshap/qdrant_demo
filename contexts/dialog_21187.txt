BRANDON: It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?
BETTY: I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store. That man last night--the one that followed me--
BRANDON: I don't think that's on the market anymore. I'd like something much closer to the water.
BRANDON: Cant be too close for me. Right across the street from it suits me. Anything else listed?
BETTY: There's another man--right outside the booth here. I never saw him Before.
BRANDON: You're probably mistaken about that. Let's get together sand talk it over. There's always a solution to these problems. But it must be near the water. Quite near-- Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
