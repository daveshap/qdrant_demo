Why did Newton introduced inertial and gravitational mass in the first place? This might be a silly question but I really don't understand what was the reason for which Newton ended up differentiating mass into inertial and gravitational. Why did he think it necessary to do so?For example, an object is made to accelerate over an almost frictionless surface and then the same object is dropped from a certain height. The same objects in both the cases, the same amount of matter in both the cases, but they are said to be different.The mass in first case is said to be inertial mass and that in second case is called gravitational mass. But why did newton think of classifying mass? And also what is the significance of this differentiation?
