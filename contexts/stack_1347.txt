Radon Manometer shows negative prey when off I had a Radon mitigation system installed last week. When I turned on the fan it was all working great. A few days later the pressure level started to drop a little each day, until day 4 it was even. Then when I turn off the fan circuit breaker the level goes negative. So the fan is still pulling. What would cause the pressure to be greater in the pipe, open to the outside, then in the basement?
