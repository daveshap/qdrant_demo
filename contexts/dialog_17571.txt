LEONARD							 *: What cop?
TEDDY: This bad cop. He checked you into the			 * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		 * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
LEONARD: Envelopes?							 *
TEDDY: He knows you're no good on the phone, so		 * he calls you up to bullshit you.				 * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			 * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		 * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		 * being some local drug dealer.					*
LEONARD: How do you know this?
TEDDY: 'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
LEONARD: How do you know him?
TEDDY: I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
