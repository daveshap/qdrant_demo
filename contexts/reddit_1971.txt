How I view top 20 admissions.
Ok, picture this:

&#x200B;

Its 5:00pm and you have been sitting in a crowded room for nine hours. The air conditioner broke so its hot and stuffy and the technician wont come to repair it till Friday. For more weeks than you care to count, you have been reading application after application of highly qualified, exceptionally talented students of whom you can only admit 10%. If you read one more story about some kid's parents' divorce, you are going to jump out the window.

&#x200B;

Some bastard, whose hair rivals that of Marco Rubio, and who ate the danish you left in the break room with a note SPECIFICALLY SAYING IT WAS YOUR DANISH, pulls out yet another application.

&#x200B;

The applicant's GPA is about the average of the accepted students. But their test scores are a bit low by the schools standards. You keep reading the application while your eyes struggle to stay open when something catches your attention. The applicant is a pianist. Immediately your mind calls back to your dear old father, who used to play the piano for you in your infancy, and who passed away after a long battle with dementia.

&#x200B;

The piercing voice of the aforementioned bastard snaps you out of your nostalgic haze. "All in favor of accepting"?

&#x200B;

You raise your hand.

&#x200B;

The next applicant, lets call them ***you***, has worked hard for the past four years for a highly competitive test score and GPA. They have also foregone their social lives in favor of an impressive and diverse array of extracurricular activities. They are, for all intents and purposes, a very competitive applicant.

&#x200B;

But, the room had voted to accept the last seven applicants. So now there is a bit of a subconscious push to keep things even. And, the fact that their essay is the twenty-eighth divorce story you have read today isn't helping much either. Half the room raises their hand and you have the tie breaking vote. "Nah", you think.

Meanwhile, admissions officer Dave is at home with the flu. His parents got divorced when he was young so he has a soft spot for that kind of story. If Dave had just remembered to wash his hands before eating his chili dog, he might have not caught the flu, might have been at work today, and maybe, just maybe, ***you*** would have been spending the next four years at the school of your dreams.

&#x200B;

Do not base your self worth on college admissions. They are a better reflection of what the dean had for breakfast than they are of you as a human being. Just apply to as many as you can afford to and hope for the best. Its gambling and should be viewed as such.

&#x200B;

Good luck everyone.

Edit 1: When I posted this, all I could think was "this is too long. No one is going to read this". Thanks for all the karma guys. Good luck!

Edit 2: For anyone who's curious, I wrote my common app essay about my parents divorce.
