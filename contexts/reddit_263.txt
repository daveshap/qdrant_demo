Help, please.
I’m gonna get personal for a second I’m 16 years old and I’m being sexually assaulted by my step dad, I’m not sure if my mom doesn’t believe me or if she’s part of it but she says I’m making it all up. I’ve called the police, cps, I’ve gone to several police stations and the most they do is say they’re going to investigate but I never hear back from them. Weird question but is there any advice as to what I can do to drive him crazy and out of the apartment? I’ve tried locking him out,  flattening his tires and leaking his debit card info. I’m not afraid to hurt him a little bit but I don’t want to murder anyone. I just want him away from me and my brother.
