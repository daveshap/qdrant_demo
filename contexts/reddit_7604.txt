Graduate assistantship canceled due to COVID-19, are they allowed to without the rest of my stipend?
I work as a graduate residence director at a DC university. Given the COVID-19 epidemic the residence halls are now closed for the semester and I am relieved of my duties. So salary is a stipend of $7500 for the year however it is distributed on a bi-weekly basis; are they allowed to not give us the rest of the stipend? They havenâ€™t given us a direct answer yet.
