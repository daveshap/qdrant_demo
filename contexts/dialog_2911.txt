CATHERINE: Aren't you going to thank me?
NICK: What's it about?
CATHERINE: A boy kills his parents. They have a plane. He makes it look like an accident.
NICK: Why does he do it?
CATHERINE: To see if he can get away with it.
NICK: When did you write it?
CATHERINE: You mean did I write it before my parents died?
NICK: Yes.
CATHERINE: No. I wrote it years afterwards.
CATHERINE: You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
NICK: No.
CATHERINE: Good. I'd miss you. You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
NICK: I'll risk it.
CATHERINE: Why take the risk?
NICK: To see if I can get away with it.
NICK: How's your new book?
CATHERINE: I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
