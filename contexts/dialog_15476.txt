ALVAREZ: Mr. Kramer?
TED: Yes?
ALVAREZ: I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
TED: Oh, yes. Won't you come in.
ALVAREZ: Where is the child?
TED: He's in his room, playing.
ALVAREZ: Good. I'll see him in there.
ALVAREZ: Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
TED: Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly. At the moment I am seeing no one.
ALVAREZ: Does that distress you?
TED: Not particularly.
ALVAREZ: What does?
TED: The prospect of losing my child.
ALVAREZ: Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
TED: Billy. This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
BILLY: Sure.
