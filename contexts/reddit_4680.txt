So depressed it takes effort to breathe today. I hate days like this.
I have plenty to be depressed about, but I have plenty to be grateful for as well.  Sometimes the darkness wins.  I can't see the color in flowers, can't taste the sweetness in my coffee.  All I can do is go over and over in my head about how much I hurt, how few people out there understand this pain, how much I'm dreading the next five minutes, ten minutes, 12 hours... I could be dead in a matter of seconds and this would all end, but I never go that route.  But I could, maybe one day.  But not today.
