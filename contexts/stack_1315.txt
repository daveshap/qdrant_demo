Outlet wiring & single pole switch I have a 10 x 10 bedroom.  One single pole switch, four 15 amp outlets sitting on a 20 amp circuit breaker.  Each of the four outlets (typical double receptacles) -- 1, 2, 2, 3 and 4 are \"hot\" i.e. the single pole with has no effect.  Outlet 1 has a red wire.  Outlets 2, 3 and 4 are wired with white and black...no red wires.  If I want to have Outlet 2's top receptacle be operated by the pole switch do I simply break/remove the black terminals connector plate (not sure proper term) between the black terminals and it will work in on/off mode with the switch ?Thank you in advance for taking this \"newbie\" question.Ross
