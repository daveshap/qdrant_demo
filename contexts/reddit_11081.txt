Hello fellow youth! J/K I’m a dad of a teen and feel like I need to get something off my chest.
First, and I want to make this abundantly clear, it is never ok to hit a kid or get in their face and scream (emotional abuse). So if your parents do this, they are wrong and I’m not defending them.

Second, I browse this subreddit because it helps me understand things from the teenage point of view, my son doesn’t really talk to me about serious matters, it seems he has a hard time opening up about serious stuff.

Third, I see a lot of posts and comments about parents “flipping out over small stuff.” The small stuff can add up to be “big stuff” if you let it. It can get supremely annoying having to clean up the same breakfast mess every day, when I’ve explicitly told him to do it and I need to leave for work. Or when I’m doing laundry and can’t find any towels, then I go into his bedroom and there are SIX towels on the bedroom floor. Those are just a couple examples, but basically by not taking care of the “small things,” you are communicating to your parents that their time isn’t valuable, or that *they* are not valuable. 

Don’t crucify me, just trying to help you guys see a different viewpoint.

Edit: Wasn’t looking for awards, but thanks guys. Keep being awesome!
