How bad is it to get a "verbal discipline"?
They've either just implemented them at my new-ish job or they're doubling down on giving them out. Or they just didn't talk about them before. How bad is it to get a verbal discipline? I've not gotten one, but I'm curious. What is it? What does it mean to get one? There is some information online, but it's not overly informative. How common of a practice is this at other companies? I've not heard of it at my other jobs, but admittedly, I don't have much experience in the labor force.
