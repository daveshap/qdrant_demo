Applying to a RD and a ARD role at the same school? Red flags?
So, second-year grad checking in. Job search basically in full swing. There's a school I'd really like to work at, with positions as an RD and ARD posted on their job board. I will be finishing with a MS in Educational Administration. Does that mean I'm probably over-qualified for the ARD role? The school only has bachelor's required for that position, with no mention of a Master's. Would it look bad if I submitted essentially the same application (changing wording/titles/etc.) for both positions since it's probably the same hiring committee? 

For context, I really want to land in one of my preferred geographic areas (Seattle area/Western Wash, Denver, a few others) but don't want to seem like I'm desperate. The ARD position pays well enough that I'm certainly considering it, but a little concerned about what the process might look like if I apply for both positions.
