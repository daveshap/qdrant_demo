Advice to pursue a PhD?
I'm currently in a Master's program and have fallen in love with academic affairs more than student affairs and I am considering pursuing a PhD right after. Do you think it would be okay to try and go for a PhD right after graduating? I originally wanted to continue to work as an Academic Advisor as that is my previous experience prior to entering my program, but interned for the school I am in and love the administrative, academic side of things. I feel like my new goal is to teach and become a program Dean/coordinator some day!
I think I am moreso questioning whether it would look bad if I pursued a PhD right after finishing my Master's.
