How can a burnt out detective with limited skills outside of law enforcement find a new career?
Background on me: 29 years old male currently working as a police detective. I’ve been in law enforcement since I was 21 years old and have been quite successful going down this career path (officer of the year award as a detective and other commendations). I don’t have much education and only have an AA degree. I’ve found my job skills are very limited to the field I currently work in. I truly have limited to no mechanical skills unfortunately. My best “skills” are probably how I can effectively communicate with others. 

I’ve come to terms that I am just unhappy with what I do for a living and am looking for a fresh start. I don’t want to be a cop anymore, I’m burnt out, and I just want to be a regular person again....the stress, the expectations and pressure that come with this job have really taken a toll on me...Does anybody have any suggestions or ideas on how I can use my current job experience either in the private sector or another way to monetize my skill set....I don’t even know what interests me at this point, I’ve thought about maybe looking into polygraph examinations but I’m afraid of betting on myself. Well I feel like I’m rambling thank you for reading :)
