MARY PATRICK: The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver. Have you ever used a loom?
CHRISTY: Not in years.
MARY PATRICK: Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
CHRISTY: Why?
MARY PATRICK: To sell, of course. I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's. We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
CHRISTY: But don't you get money? From the Vatican?
MARY PATRICK: Mary Clarence. Goose. We're completely self-supporting. Like all convents. Like yours.
CHRISTY: Oh, right. At my old place, we used to... wash cars. Groom dogs. So... nice loom.
MARY PATRICK: Isn't it lovely? Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in. You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed. Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed. Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed. Keep tension on the warp. Is that clear?
CHRISTY: Just about. Show me again.
MARY PATRICK: You betcha.
MARY PATRICK: Shuttle, beat, shed. And watch your heddles.
CHRISTY: I love my heddles. Show me again.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
MARY PATRICK: Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
CHRISTY: Really catching on.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Good. Mary Patrick, I need you in the office. Mary Clarence, carry on.
CHRISTY: I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
CHRISTY: Look, this isn't my kind of thing! I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
