LEON: What shall we get? The news!
NINOTCHKA: No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
LEON: Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
NINOTCHKA: Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
NINOTCHKA: It's dead.
LEON: Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
