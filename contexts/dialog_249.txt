CATES: I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
HADEN: Yeah, I read the report...
CATES: Hey, the bastard's got my gun. I want it back.
HADEN: Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
CATES: Yeah...
HADEN: Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
CATES: Yeah. It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
HADEN: You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
CATES: Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
HADEN: Okay. You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine. Nail this guy and make us all look good. But you better watch your ass. If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
CATES: You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
HADEN: Jack?
CATES: Yeah?
HADEN: Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
CATES: I'll keep it in mind.
ELAINE: Great place for lunch.
CATES: Yeah, one of my favorites.
ELAINE: You made the front page.
CATES: Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
ELAINE: Jack, are you okay?
CATES: Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
