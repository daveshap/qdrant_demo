JASON: All right... here's the plan: First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere. Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
GWEN: Why does this sound so familiar?
TOMMY: Assault on Voltareck III." Episode... 31 I think."
GUY: We're doing episode 31?
TOMMY: Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire.
GWEN: How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
GUY: We're doing episode 31, Jason?
JASON: It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
GUY: Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
JASON: It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
GUY: BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
ALEXANDER: This is ludicrous. Why are you listening to this man? Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?... He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow. No offense.
TOMMY: You have a better plan, Alex?
ALEXANDER: As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
