EVAN: I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
ANDREA: You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
DR. REDFIELD: Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you. He's as handsome as his father.
EVAN: You know my father?
ANDREA: That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
EVAN: My father has a bad memory, too?
