How the heck do people know what they are supposed to do at their job
Hello, I am a 18 yo male living in south eastern part of Norway. I just got my first ever official job as a retail worker in my local grocery store. And one thing I now iced I ask a lot is “what do you want me to do now” or in the morning “what do you want me to do today”. I can’t seem to see any of my coworkers ask the same. I know it’s about takin a lot of initiative in your job. But sometimes it’s really hard. so I wonder how it is for other employees. How do you know what to do when you come to work.

I am not entirely sure if this was the right place to ask, but if it wasn’t pleas link me the right subreddit so I can do it right
