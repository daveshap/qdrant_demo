People who had a hard time getting full time work after college, what are you doing now?
I went to college around the recession, during the height of the "just go to college, a degree in anything will open doors" mindset.


Since it was the recession, companies were not actively recruiting much on campus.  It kind of seemed like an extension of high school since no one had concrete plans for their careers.  Formal internship programs with companies did not seem to be common back then, it was all unpaid crappy internships.  I was doing premed, graduated, and worked very low paying jobs in my field (biochemistry) while applying to med school.



I eventually ended up in software development at a large tech company after doing cloud/data related work.  I was doing this while getting my MS in CS and after getting sick of waiting 9 months to hear yes/no after a med school interview.


Most of my friends from college have similar stories.  We all aimlessly worked years before breaking into a good career path.  Some are currently applying to law school, others got into non-tech work at technology companies.  But we all agree going to college after high school is pointless and we should have worked a few years before college to get a sense for the job market.
