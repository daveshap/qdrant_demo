What are the sources for old (1998 or earlier) satellite or aerial photos of the (southern) Netherlands? Our municipality says that our garden is too big, according too the cadastre. If we can prove the situation has been already there for twenty years, then they won't charge us for the extra space our garden takes in.As this is the case, I'm looking to prove this. I have already tried Google Earth and Google Earth Engine, where the first didn't go back enough and the latter wasn't detailed enough. So I am looking for any source of detailed satellite/aerial photos of the southern part of the Netherlands. They don't have to be free per se, altough it is a pro.After request: the garden is about 40m\u00b2 and the dispute is about an area of 10m\u00b2 therefore 1pixel to 1m\u00b2 resolution would be sufficient
