How to use Design of Experiment (DoE) to reduce the number of simulations? I am planning to do simulation for parametric study and there are 9 parameters in total. I was suggested to use DoE to reduce the number of simulations that I need to do. I studied the basic of DoE but I am still confused about the adoption of DoE in simulation. Should I do a preliminary study first by setting 2 values for each parameter first? Also, would factorial design be influenced by multicollinearity issue of the parameters? Thirdly, each parameter may of different unit and their ranges would also be different. Would this affect the interpretation of the significance of the parameters?  Finally, what is the difference between DoE and regression (ANOVA)? It seems that ANOVA can tell you the significance of the parameters and you can do VIF for multicollinearity test. Please advise.
