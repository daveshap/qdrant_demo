Any certification or training in 6 months for salary of 50k or more in Los Angeles region?
Hi Reddit.

Former teacher here.

COVID-19 hit hard and now I am staying home with unemployment.

I got burnt out after 7 years of teaching, so now I think it is a great opportunity to change career with unemployment kicking in.

I have a bachelor's in Biology and I need around 3k a month after taxes to survive (mortage, cars, insurance, student loan, cell phone, utilities)

Are there any certification or training in 6 months that could land me to a career with 45-50k salary?

Also, something I could do in a long run, I am only 30.
