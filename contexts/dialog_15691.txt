KELLY: Different worlds, Jack.
JACK: Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world. You found anyone in yours?
KELLY: No.
JACK: So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
KELLY: You think?
JACK: Worth a try. We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
KELLY: Probably not.
JACK: That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
KELLY: Good thinking.
