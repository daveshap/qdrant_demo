What's Victor Frankenstein\u2019s birth place? I am reading the Frankenstein novel (a French edition), and in the first chapter where Victor Frankenstein starts to tell his story, he says:<blockquote>  \"Je suis n\u00e9 \u00e0 Gen\u00e8ve et ma famille est l'une des plus distingu\u00e9es de cette r\u00e9publique.\" (\"I was born in Geneva [...].\")</blockquote>But two pages later, he says:<blockquote>  \"Apr\u00e8s l'Italie, ils visit\u00e8rent l'Allemagne et la France. Moi-m\u00eame, leur premier enfant, je naquis \u00e0 Naples [...].\" (\"I was born in Naples [...].\")</blockquote>So where was he really born? Is this a bad translation from the original English novel? Why this contradiction?
