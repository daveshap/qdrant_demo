JACK: My God! Look!
GUMP: Something the matter?
JACK: Ogg's footprints!
GUMP: Shhh! Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
GUMP: Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
JACK: Certainly understandable.
GUMP: Very secretive, they are. Keep their feet covered up. Best if you don't mention it.
OGG: Step lively now!
JACK: His feet shall never cross my lips.
GUMP: I should hope not!
JACK: Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
