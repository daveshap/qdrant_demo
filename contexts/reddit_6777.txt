Appropriate etiquette when contacting recruiters on LinkedIn/other platforms?
Hey folks. I just relocated to a new city and am trying to use all the professional tools I can to build a new professional network here (Alumni Associations ect.). When it comes to online platforms however, I realize that I'm not really sure when it is acceptable to reach out to a recruiter directly, particularly on LinkedIn. To give a specific example, there is one semi-private organization I really, *really*, want to work for. I would describe them as a think tank/nonprofit that is a consultancy for private businesses. This particular organization does their recruiting in house. I activated the free month of LinkedIn premium, so I am able to see the recruiter who posted the job I'm considering applying for. I am tempted to use my new LinkedIn features to contact her and ask a few questions (am I qualified, are there other positions I'm better qualified for) and express how much I want to work for them in any capacity. I am of course worried about to things: 1, will this come off as desperate rather than proactive? 2, will this be seen as bad etiquette on the platform and potentially shut me out of future opportunities with them because I look like a rude jerk abusing my "premium" powers? I know that these are the kind of connections the platform is designed to provide to people, but I can easily see how reaching out to someone in the wrong way could make you look like an idiot who feels entitled to their time for no reason. Am I overthinking these online interactions, or are my concerns legitimate?  Any recruiters here who have felt pestered by someone trying to become a prospect? Thanks in advance for the advice!
