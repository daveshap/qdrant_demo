HARRY: All right. Two hundred.
KINNEAR: Ha.
GLENDA: Yes. I met him last year.
CARTER: Go on.
GLENDA: Oh yes. When he came up on business.
CARTER: Really?
GLENDA: He came to see Mr Kinnear.
CARTER: No.
HARRY: What's that?
KINNEAR: That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
HARRY: Four hundred?
KINNEAR: That's right.
HARRY: You're not seeing me?
KINNEAR: No.
HARRY: I'll see you, then.
KINNEAR: Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
GLENDA: We went about together.
CARTER: Really?
GLENDA: Yes, while he was here.
CARTER: While he was here. You went about together?
GLENDA: He was here for four days.
CARTER: Was he?
GLENDA: Could you do me a favour?
CARTER: Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
GLENDA: Could you please put my glass on the table?
