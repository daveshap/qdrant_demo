COLE: I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid. It was on TV.
RAILLY: Shh -- don't talk. Hold still.
COLE: I have seen it, but I don't remember this part. Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past. The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
RAILLY: If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
COLE: Flowers! What flowers?
