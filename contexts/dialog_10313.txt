NICKY: I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
ELLIOT: I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
NICKY: You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
ELLIOT: What do I exude?
NICKY: Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
ELLIOT: Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
NICKY: Tonight. What's tonight?
ELLIOT: Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
NICKY: You mean because What's-His-Name.
ELLIOT: You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
NICKY: It's just a review.
ELLIOT: It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
NICKY: What's the fuss? I don't get it.
ELLIOT: That's what I said eighteen months ago.
NICKY: What happened eighteen months ago?
ELLIOT: Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
NICKY: And he was there?
ELLIOT: Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
NICKY: That's awful.
ELLIOT: I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
NICKY: A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
