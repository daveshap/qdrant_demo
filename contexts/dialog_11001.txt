LEVENE: Ah, fuck. Leads! Leads! Williamson! Send me out! Send me out!
WILLIAMSON: The leads are coming.
LEVENE: Get 'em to me!
WILLIAMSON: I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago. They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
LEVENE: Did you tell 'em my sale?
WILLIAMSON: How could I tell 'em your sale? Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads. Alright? Shelly. Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal. You made a good sale. Fine.
LEVENE: It's better than a good sale. It's a...
WILLIAMSON: Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
LEVENE: All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
WILLIAMSON: The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
LEVENE: What does that fucking mean?
WILLIAMSON: That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
LEVENE: Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you. That's what I'm saying. You have no idea of your job. A man's his job and you're fucked at yours. You hear what I'm saying to you? Your end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care. You don't know what it is
WILLIAMSON: I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly.
LEVENE: Would you? Would you...? Or you're gonna what, fire me?
WILLIAMSON: It's not impossible.
LEVENE: On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon.
ROMA: You closed 'em today?
LEVENE: Yes. I did. This morning. What I'm saying to you: things can change. You see? This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know. You can't look down the road. And see what's coming. Might be someone else, John. It might be someone new, eh? Someone new. And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history. You ask them. When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man? A month...? Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row. You know what that means? You know what that means? Is that luck? Is that some, some, some purloined leads? That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
ROMA: ...yes...
LEVENE: ...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around. That's cold calling. Walk up to the door. I don't even know their name. I'm selling something they don't even want. You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
ROMA: That's right, Shel.
LEVENE: And, and, and, I did it. And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door. But you don't know. You don't know. You never heard of a streak. You never heard of marshaling your sales force..." What are you
ROMA: He's right, Williamson.
