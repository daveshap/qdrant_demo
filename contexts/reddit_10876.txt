I stay alive because Iâ€™m guilted into remaining on this earth to avoid causing pain to my loved ones.
I wish I had the inner strength to actually follow through on my plan - take a Greyhound bus to a different state and and kill myself there. No one would be able to identify me, I would be a Jane Doe and my loved ones would just think I got kidnapped or something.
