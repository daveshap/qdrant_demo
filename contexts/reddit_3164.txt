My mom and stepdad (early fifties) are poor and unskilledâ€”what can they do to make more money?
Hello,

I'm not asking for advice for myself but rather my mom and stepdad, who are in their early fifties. They're both immigrants from Vietnam. My mom came here about 25 years ago. She's currently a citizen and can speak enough English to communicate but not understand grammar or more technical things. She does nails at a nail shop owned by her friend, but business is extremely slow. My stepfather came here just two years ago. He doesn't speak English and currently works for minimum wage at a Chinese restaurant. They make under $30,000 a year combined.

What should they do at their age and skill level to make more money and improve their lives? My mom could make a lot more money if she worked at another nail shop, but she doesn't want to do anything besides manicures and pedicures because doing fake nails requires use of harmful chemicals, although it makes more money. I think she's counting on my uncle, her brother, to help her buy her own nail shop. He's an occupational therapist and makes decent money, but there's no guarantee he'll help her. Also, he's out of work at the moment.

My stepdad seems to have settled in to his minimum wage restaurant job. He has a license to do nails, but he doesn't seem interested in it. He probably should have gone for a hair cutting license, but they decided against it for some reason.

I was thinking (although maybe it's not too realistic) that my mom could take English classes and then attend college to get a degree in something, like nursing. While she's not working, I could help her out a bit. Maybe my stepdad could do something similar. If not, though, what are some good options for them to make more money and increase their standard of living?
