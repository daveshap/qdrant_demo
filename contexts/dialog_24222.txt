ICHABOD: May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
HARDENBROOK: Hmm? See them?
ICHABOD: May we look at them now?
HARDENBROOK: Of course. You want them... it shall not take long. Wait here.
ICHABOD: Maybe you should take this.
HARDENBROOK: A fine idea.
YOUNG MASBATH: What good is this?
ICHABOD: To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
HARDENBROOK: Damn... damn... damn...
ICHABOD: Master Hardenbrook...
ICHABOD: Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?
HARDENBROOK: Well... that might be... helpful.
YOUNG MASBATH: My father had farm land. It was the only thing we owned of any value.
ICHABOD: And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus. I heard him say it.
YOUNG MASBATH: Yes.
