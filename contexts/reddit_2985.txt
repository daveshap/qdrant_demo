I left my IT Support job of legacy mainframe systems. Right now i am focused on practicing Python coding and getting an AWS certification. I will eventually start to apply for developer role once i gain enough knowledge. Am i doing the right thing ?
I am 23 years old and have graduated at 2018 with a BTech degree at computer science. I worked for a year after my graduation at my previous IT support job. I left it because i didnt like to work on mainframes. It's been 3 months since i have left my job. I really want to get skilled ASAP so that i can start applying at the companies. Am i doing the right thing here ?
