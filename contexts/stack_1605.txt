MOSFET failing test I purchased a repair kit for a TV SMPS.The kit contained 3 identical N channel MOSFETs (K8A50D), among other components.I tested all 3 with a DMM following a number of identical instruction videos. The MOSFETs passed all the test for shorts.All 3 appeared to fail to take a charge from the positive DMM lead to gate and allow drain to source continuity.I find it hard to believe all 3 were bad components but can\u2019t see what I am doing wrong.I assume the DMM is supplying sufficient voltage to meet the Gate to Source threshold.Any suggestions or comments?
