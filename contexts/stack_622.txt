How to develop in Android Studio inside VM, but launch parallel VM with Android? I'm in a situation where I need to develop in Android Studio inside a KVM running Ubuntu. I know I can redirect the USB of my phone inside this VM and upload the apks to my phone. But how can I launch a VM parallel to my ubuntu VM? (I'm trying to avoid launching the Android VM inside the Ubuntu VM, so I want to load the Android VM in the same host as my Ubuntu running Android Studio).If I simply launch an Android on KVM parallel to my Ubuntu in KVM with Android Studio, how to connect the 2? I think this will require some tweaks, like, is it possible to make the Android virtual machine answer adb commands like an USB device and then redirect this usb device into the ubuntu virtual machine?
