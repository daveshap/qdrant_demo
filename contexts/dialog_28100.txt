RHIAN: We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
LOMBARD: Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
RHIAN: He just said he had good reasons.
LOMBARD: Good reasons?
RHIAN: That’s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn’t take on another child, that he’d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn’t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he’s back on drugs, eh? Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know? Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people’s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon’s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
LOMBARD: His mother would be pleased to hear that.
RHIAN: Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons... A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
LOMBARD: I’m afraid I don’t understand.
RHIAN: They’re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It’s not guilt, more of a curse... And then there’s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that’s just one of Leon’s dark delusions...
LOMBARD: Do you know Leon’s parents names?
RHIAN: Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
