Crying over my dissertation proposal
So I’m in the final proposal stages for my MBA, but my DA’s feedback and approval was just contradicted by my general dissertation professor. I broke out into tears. 

I also work a very demanding job for a public company and I’m at the stage where I think this is when my professors figure out that I’m a fraud and not smart enough to do my dissertation. 

Is this normal? I’m considering getting back on stimulants because my adhd is so bad and I can’t get through this final process without my meds, which I’ve been off for years. I tried caffeine but i react horribly to it. 

Thanks for letting my vent.
