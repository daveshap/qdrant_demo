How do I tell my job I don't want to meet clients due to covid-19?
Basically I am insurance adjuster. I am low level so I do all the field work such as canvasses and interviews. I have been authorized to do most of my interviews over the phone already however, I have a 3 year old daughter and live with my parents who are 56 and not in great health. Me going to knock on doors and meet random strangers around a large metro area seems irresponsible at this point. 

They only company response we have had is that we can expense sanitization products. I am very fortunate to work remotely for the most part and be paid. Second due to the virus they can't really replace me or get mad because it's not great hiring time. Lastly I am getting blow back from my whole family about going out. How do I frame this to my employer. They are understanding and nice, but I haven't pushed back yet and am basically I am a mindless yes man and produce tons of work because I just treat it like the army and do whatever I am told.
