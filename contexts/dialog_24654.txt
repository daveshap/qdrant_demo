KAT: No, count it, anyway.
NICK: Why?
KAT: I’m compulsive and weird?
KAT: Six thousand, right?
NICK: On the nose. I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
KAT: How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
NICK: Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
KAT: That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant. No offense.
NICK: It’s okay. Hell, I’ve never paid for it. But please don’t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
NICK: You quitting?
KAT: I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
NICK: Who are they?
KAT: Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
