KIMBALL: I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
BATEMAN: Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. Is he a suspect?
KIMBALL: Not really.
KIMBALL: Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance? Which was on the twentieth of December?
BATEMAN: God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
BATEMAN: I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
KIMBALL: Wait. That's not what I've got.
BATEMAN: What?
KIMBALL: That's not the information I've received.
BATEMAN: Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
KIMBALL: Let's see... That you were with-
BATEMAN: Well, I could he wrong.
KIMBALL: Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
BATEMAN: We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
KIMBALL: Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
BATEMAN: Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
KIMBALL: Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
BATEMAN: Great, yes, I'd like that.
KIMBALL: And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
BATEMAN: Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
