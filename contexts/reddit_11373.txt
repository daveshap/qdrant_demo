I Owe So Much Money
So, I'm a soon to be sophomore in college and I wasn't ready for the real world. 

My family has sucked me dry financially, I owe my previous bank $430, my credit it suffering because I've maxed out my only credit card last school year and I have no money to even make the monthly payments.

All of my refund checks were spent helping my family with food and bills. Between books and my family, I had no money to myself. Hardly any to even wash my clothes, buy body wash, or even toothpaste. I had to go begging my friends like a hobo... 

I owe AT&T almost $300 because my brother wanted some internet in the house and I was the only person with good enough credit to get it. While I was away in school, noone kept up with the payments and even though my brother claimed to have discontinued the service, they kept charging me. All of the letters from AT&T were just shoved into some drawer, unopened! 

Somebody drove my car and got me a ticket! The price keeps going up every month and no one seems to want to pay it. I won't even be able to go to court if I get summoned seeing as that my school is 18 hours away... 

I'm freaking out over how I'm going to find a job. I have too many school related expenses and I can't rely on a relative to help because they all have their own financial troubles.

My car is another situation in itself... I think I'm just going to make another post about it. 

I feel so weak and useless and stupid and taken advantage of and WEAK. This is only half of my troubles and I wish I was strong enough to get through this.
