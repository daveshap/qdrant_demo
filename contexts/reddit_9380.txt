My credit score is now over 700!!!!!
Hi throwaway account 


I had to take out a personal loan of $20,000 to pay credit card debt I racked up while In school and medical issues. I got the loan without telling a soul because no one knew how bad my financial situation was and I was so scared. 

I had $20,000 on a high interest cc from Amex that I couldn’t handle anymore (“I’m getting it for AIRLINE MILES” my 19 yr old self said while signing for a 23% apr credit card lesson freakin LEARNED) plus student loan plus car payment. 

After getting the personal loan my credit score to a hit and got down to 640 and I freaked out (it was going down anyway because of my cc debt and not being able to make min payments).  I thought I was in a hole forever.  Well it is now over 700 and I am breathing for the first time!!!


I wanna thank ynab because holy crap did that help me control my money. And I want to thank this subreddit because instead of making me DROWN in guilt it has helped me OVERCOME!

thank you so much!!!
