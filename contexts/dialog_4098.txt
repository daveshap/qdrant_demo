SANTIAGO: Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
GEORGE: Yes, I am.
SANTIAGO: For instance, something like this?
GEORGE: Very nice. I'll take it.
SANTIAGO: Ha ha ha. You are funny. Really, how much will you be needing?
GEORGE: All of it. As much as you've got. A couples thousand pounds. I'll be back in a week with a plane.
SANTIAGO: Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast. You take a little and then come back.
GEORGE: I don't need a little. I need a lot.
SANTIAGO: Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well. We must be careful.
GEORGE: What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars? Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
SANTIAGO: Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
TUNA: I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
KEVIN: Don't be such a pussy.
