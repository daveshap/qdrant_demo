EMMETT: Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
PADEN: You got no idea what they were after?
PADEN: Offend anybody lately?
EMMETT: Not for five years.
PADEN: Jefferson City?
EMMETT: No, Leavenworth.
PADEN: I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
EMMETT: I had to get up anyway.
PADEN: Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
EMMETT: Looks like that's not all they admired.
PADEN: Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
EMMETT: Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
PADEN: Where's the pinto going?
EMMETT: I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
PADEN: Where's Turley?
EMMETT: South of here, past Chimayo.
PADEN: Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
EMMETT: Yeah, maybe a bath.
