Tinder and Bumble for a week. A Meta-analysis.
**Introduction:** Hello everyone, i'm Alex and i've been visiting this sub-reddit for a year now, i always saw a lot of posts about OLD and how unfair and uneffective it was, especially for the boys. OLD is slowly becoming the standard way in which a guy and a girl meet for a relationship, let's face it, almost everyone has Tinder. So i decided to try myself to take  some results out of it and share with everyone to have a nice discussion about it. Also that's my first post and english is not my main language, if something comes out bad i will modify it as soon as possible, you can also correct me please.

**Background:** I'm a 25 years old guy born in Romania and raised in Rome currently living in Frankfurt,Germany and i don't speak german yet,i study nursing sciences and work in the construction field to pay my course, i don't have anything particular or exciting, i'm not a fancy hipster who loves art and likes to travel and taking photos, i'm not muscular and i don't always have positive vibes going on (wtf). In short, i'm a normal guy with no particular ability just a big interest in social dynamics and the evolution of modern interactions between people.

**Purpose:** To open a big discussion on the effectiveness of the OLD and the cons that comes with it. Also i made a list ofthe main topics:

1. Which app is the most succesfull.
2. What kind of conversations come up during the interactions.
3. Do looks matter? Or is the interaction more valuable?
4. Ghosting percentile.

I need some participation to answer those topics so feel free to share your numbers and experiences.

Also that's not a meta-analysis but that word looks too great in the title to pass on it!

**7 days on Tinder and Bumble:** So i downloaded both apps on 19th of september and set up the profiles with these photos and without any description (added my height because that's one of my strong points).

**Tinder results:** 29 matches

1 girl texted me

3 girls got a text from me

2 girls answered

0 dates set up

**Bumble results:** 14 matches

10 girls texted me

0 dates set up

I should say that all the girls i've talked to ghosted me at one point or the conversation died. There are only 2 left which i'm still talking to and i feel like they will stop texting very soon.

**Conversation examples:**     1.   [https://imgur.com/7twVMcH](https://imgur.com/7twVMcH)

**Conclusions:** I have to be honest with you, i couldn't wait for this to be over, it was nice during the first swipes getting a lot of matches, later on the days passed and every conversation i had was not stimulating, poor, boring and most importantly it never came to a conclusion, of a date or a hang out.

I also was very frustrated when they stopped answering out of nowhere and for no reason, to me it felt like these apps are used just like instagram, to show off the appearence and nothing more. Many girls have their instagram on their description (always swiped left on those) and the majority of them are so clich√® with the traveling, photography, art, positive vibes, fitness related stuff and so on. I've found no one interesting.

One thing i noticed is that even if i didn't enjoy the swaping thing i would always be attracted towards it, i've found myself continuously  reaching for the phone to swipe and check the girls, i find it very detrimental.

To close this topic out i'd like to say that i don't feel like these apps are made for genuine people with genuine purpouses (sex or relationship), it's more about showing off and texting with someone when bored. I don't feel like if you don't match with some girls or if someone ghosts you or doesn't answer you back means that you have something wrong or that you're not good looking or your eloquence is bad. But those are just my opinions, let me know yours and i hope you liked it, if this discussion has some success i will do a 20 or 30 days osservation. You can test it yourself and make your own post, let's be creative!

\*OLD stands for "Online dating"
