CHRISTINE: What's with him?
NICHOLAS: I don't know... he fell.
CHRISTINE: Do you know what to do?
NICHOLAS: I don't think he's breathing.
NICHOLAS: Oh, God... !
CHRISTINE: Don't just stand there, get help!
NICHOLAS: This can't be real...
CHRISTINE: He's pissing his pants. Is that real enough for you? Call 911!
NICHOLAS: Alright... okay...
CHRISTINE: He's turning blue!
