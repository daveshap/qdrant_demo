DIEGO: I never believed you were a murderer. I knew. I knew you are a magico. I have seen it in you. It's in your spirit.
GEORGE: I'm tired, Diego. Go to bed.
DIEGO: You like to make the boundaries disappear. It's not only the money, is it, George? The adventure is part of the victory. It's the thrill, ah?
GEORGE: Good night.
DIEGO: In my country, I am a magico. A man with a dream. A man on the rise. To take nothing and make it something, okay? I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish. That is why I am in your country. Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream. Do you have a dream, George?
GEORGE: I would if I could get some sleep.
DIEGO: Yes, you have a dream. And maybe you accomplish your dream. But yet you failed. Why?
GEORGE: Because I got caught.
DIEGO: No, my brother.
GEORGE: Because they caught me?
DIEGO: You failed because you had the wrong dream.
DIEGO: George? What do you know about cocaine?
GEORGE: I don't know, Diego. I've got a good thing going already. Everybody smokes pot. It's easy. Cocaine is a rich man's drug. It's too expensive.
DIEGO: No, no. That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap. In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo. IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
GEORGE: That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
DIEGO: And that's wholesale. Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
GEORGE: Oh my G-d.
DIEGO: Yes. And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
GEORGE: Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.
DIEGO: Now do you see what I am saying?
GEORGE: Getting it here is no problem. Trust me. I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply? How much can we get?
DIEGO: Don't worry. We will talk of everything. We have the time. You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
DIEGO: What type of planes do you have?
GEORGE: Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
DIEGO: How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
GEORGE: I don't know. A hundred, hundred and fifty. How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
DIEGO: Fifteen hundred. We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
GEORGE: We'll refuel in the Bahamas. I know someone there.
DIEGO: Great. I love the Bahamas.
GEORGE: Diego Delgado, please?
DIEGO: Allo?
GEORGE: Diego? It's George.
DIEGO: George, hallo! Today is the day, ah? Are you out?
GEORGE: Yeah, I'm out.
DIEGO: Congratulations, brother. I've been waiting for you.
GEORGE: How are we doing?
DIEGO: Perfect, George. Perfect. Everything is fine down here. Everything is all set up.
GEORGE: Do we need a plane? How does this work? When do I see you?
DIEGO: Slow down, George. Slow down.
DIEGO: You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody. Ho ho ho. Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
GEORGE: I can't go anywhere, Diego. I'm on parole. I can't leave the state.
DIEGO: But you must. It's the only way.
GEORGE: I just got released five minutes ago.
DIEGO: George, are we gonna do this or not?
GEORGE: Good to see you, Diego.
DIEGO: Yes. Look around you. The sun. The water. The women. It's better than Danbury, no? Come on. I have some friends I would like you to meet.
DIEGO: Fifteen kilos. Seven and a half in each suitcase. You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
GEORGE: Okay.
CESAR: Not so fast. I would like to go over the details.
GEORGE: What details? I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
CESAR: Tell me about the suitcases. What is the make and the color?
