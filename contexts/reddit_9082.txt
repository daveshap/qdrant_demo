To what extent does the local/civilian effort in Puerto Rico differ from those in past disasters?
President Trump has [made claims](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/us/politics/trump-puerto-rico-mayor.html) over the past few weeks that the local organizations in Puerto Rico are not doing their job well enough and that our [military should not be needed](http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/16/politics/donald-trump-puerto-rico-water-distribution/index.html) to pass out supplies. Is the recovery effort on the ground atypical compared to other disasters? If so, what are the causes? To what extent are inadequacies in infrastructure prior to the storm, lack of civilian/local government organization, and being an island rather than on the mainland, etc, causing extra difficulty? Are there comparable disasters in recent history and did the federal response differ?
