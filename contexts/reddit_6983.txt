Laid off yesterday from first job after college, already have two interviews for jobs I applied to several weeks ago. Do I tell my potential employers about the layoff?
Hi all, as the title says, I was laid off from my first post-college job yesterday (I started in June, so I was there for 7 months). The layoff was unexpected - I was dissatisfied at the company, but it seems that they realized they made a mistake in hiring me as they have never had enough work for me as a totally entry level person and ultimately didn't think I was the right fit for the job. Luckily the official language that I received about the layoff does not place any blame on me. I don't have a problem mentioning the layoff in the future, but I am wondering what to do about some jobs that I already applied for. I was pretty unhappy at my old company and started applying for jobs back in December, and just heard back from two of them earlier this week and this morning. I have interviews tomorrow and next week, but those interviewers do not know that I was laid off as I wasn't when I applied. How do I discuss this in interviews? Do I refer to my old job in past tense? Do I only mention if asked? My old employer was nice and offered to serve as a good reference, so they aren't upset or malicious - I'm just nervous because now I do really need a job. Thanks in advance everyone.
