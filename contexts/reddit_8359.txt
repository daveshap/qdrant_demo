2019 UK General Election Megathread
**I HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO CALL A CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY OF BETWEEN 360-367 SEATS**

---

It may seem like deja vu, but we are back with a new UK General Election, the third in five years. This is because [a snap election was called by MP's back in October](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-why-boris-johnson-brexit-vote-deal-conservatives-explained-a9201081.html) after a stalemate on the issue of Brexit - this is why it's being dubbed the 'Brexit Election.' If Boris Johnson is to win, he will be able to get Brexit deal done by the 31st.

There are all 650 seats up for grabs - that's a majority requirement of 326 seats.

Current [FT polling](https://www.ft.com/content/263615ca-d873-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17) has the Conservatives at 43%, Labour at 33%. However, with the First Past the Post electoral system, it is hard to know how this will translate into actual seats.

Whatever happens, it will be monumental and set the UK on its course for the next five years - and perhaps even more if the issue of Brexit can be resolved.

You can watch the election as it happens on [BBC news](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/election-2019-50755004), or the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/12/general-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). You can also watch a livestream [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Auq9mYxFEE) - with special guest, Former Speaker John Bercow.

If you have any questions about this election, please feel free to ask them. This is also an open discussion forum (No Top Level Comment Requirements), so we will be more lenient on the rules, but do not think it makes this a free for all.

**LIVE UPDATES**

---

**21:19:** As polls enter their final hour, the first rumours of what the electoral landscape might become is leaking out. [Deputy Financial Times Editor Steven Swinford](https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1205218026997596160) has stated that Conservative support in London's constituencies are looking "difficult", but are hoping to regain losses in the Leave-voting North of England.

**21:50:** Political Editor for the Sun Newspaper has reported that there is a [50/50 chance on a Hung Parliament/Narrow Conservative Win](https://twitter.com/tnewtondunn/status/1205242626548674563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205242626548674563&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll)

**22:01:** The Exit Polls have come in. The Conservatives have 368 seats, with Labour on 191. SNP have 55 seats. That's a 86 majority - Margaret Thatcher levels. If that's true, that's a phenomenal result, and gives Boris is mandate to "GET BREXIT DONE!" by the 31st of January. 

These are not the final results, just a poll and should not be trusted completely. There is still a lot that can change.

**22:27:** Where does this leave Labour under Jeremy Corbyn? This is the worst result for Labour since 1935. There are already calls for him to resign, however his shadow cabinet are standing by him - for now.

**22:29:**[ If the 55 out of 58 SNP seats in Scotland](https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1205246386846994441?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) is to be believed, just one shy of their all-time high in 2015, and a 20 seat gain, this will put Scotland at odds with Westminster. A hard right, Leave Conservative government would be clashing with a Remain voting Scottish Nationalist government up north - putting the state of the Union in even more jeopardy. Scotland would want a 2nd Independence Referendum, and claimed this election would give them a mandate to have one, however the Conservatives have put any notion of one away.

**22:42:** The Guardian are reporting that the exit polls suggest that Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson is set to lose her seat in East Dumbartonshire, Scotland.

**22:46:** [The Pound has climbed against the Dollar](https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-pound-wins-as-exit-poll-predicts-big-tory-majority-11884813) and the Euro by almost as much as 5 cents as the exit polls came in, citing stability in the UK political climate and a clearer future. This may also harm the attack that many Remainers used that leaving the EU would harm the UK economy.

**23:17:** Labour's heartlands in the Midlands - the so called Red Wall - is apparently swinging hard to the Conservatives, which is where many of these gains are likely to come from.

**23:26** The traditional race to get the first results are in from Newcastle Central. The results are Con: 9,290  Lab: 21,568 Lib: 2709 Green: 1,365 BXP: 2542. This seat was a Leave voting seat, but the Labour candidate was re-elected by a majority of over 12,000, but this is a 7% loss from 2017.

**23:34** In Sunderland South, Labour lost [18% of votes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000754), and Blyth swung from Labour to Tory after they lost [15% of votes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000575). These are all traditional Labour seats - and many were narrow vote Leave seats.

**00:32**[ Swindon North hold for Conservatives](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000851). Doubled Labour's vote. Labour are down 8% here.

**01:03** A Labour seat that they won by over 10k votes in 2017 has [gone to a recount](https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1205289992840458241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205289992840458241&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). This does not look good for the Labour Party.

**01:40** So far, Conservatives have gained 3 seats, SNP gained 1 seat, and Labour have lost 4 seats. We have only just begun. However, if these numbers are to be believed, the Exit Poll seems to be more or less accurate.

**02:03:** The first Labour gain has come in from Putney. The gain [has given Labour a 6% lead](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1205304811979182080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205304811979182080&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). This is a London seat and was expected to swing to Labour.

**02:32:** Results so far - 52 Conservatives, 47 Labour, 7 Scottish Nationalists, 1 Liberal Democrats, 5 "OTHERS".

**02:46:** Results so far - 78 Con, 68 Lab, 13 SNP, 1 Lib Dem, 5 "Others"

Currently, Labour has lost, on average, a share of votes of around 10%. This is almost historic. Most swings are between 2-4%. Tony Blair only surpassed this with a 15% swing in favour in 1998

**02:58** Chuka Unama, a former Conservative who joined the Liberal Democrats, [has lost his seat to the Conservaitves.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000639) This comes after both Labour and Liberal Democrats - a self proclaimed Remain alliance - ended up splitting the vote. If they voted tactically, they would have won by more than 6k votes.

**03:09:** DUP's Deputy Leader, Nigel Dodds, has lost [his seat to Sinn Fein](https://www.itv.com/news/utv/2019-12-13/live-counting-underway-at-centres-across-ni/)

**03:19:** Liberal Democrats [gained a Conservative seat, the first of the night](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1205325042067935232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205325042067935232&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll)

**03:35** It is expected that Jeremy Corbyn is going to stand down after this election, after stating that he "will not lead the Labour Party into another General Election"

**03:52** Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has lost [her seat to the SNP by just over 100 seats](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50771123). It will be expected for her to resign, and a new leader to be elected - the fourth in the past 2 years.
