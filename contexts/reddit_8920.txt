Could a wealthy enough President just pay for large public work initiatives by him/herself?
In a recent budget fight, the White House asked for [$5 billion for border wall funding.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-continues-to-demand-5-billion-for-border-wall-as-shutdown-looms/2018/11/26/f2ff5868-f1d4-11e8-aeea-b85fd44449f5_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b1db109edc34)

Although this recent shutdown fight is not fully resolved yet, it appears the [White House is backing down](https://www.apnews.com/5066e19874654968a3c99920ade7c544) from the $5 billion demand. 

Estimates for completing construction on an entire wall run much higher than $5 billion, and [stretch from](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-border-wall-billions-unseen-costs-gao-report-2018-8) about $25 billion to $70 billion.

I have 3 questions about this:

1: For the short term budget fight and the $5 billion - Could the President just put up the money himself, or are there roadblocks from the government accepting the money, either in regards to earmarking or something else?

2: Does the answer to Question 1 change if the President doesn't just put up a portion of the money, but literally every penny needed to complete and maintain the project? 

3: A GoFundMe has been set up for [the border wall](https://www.caller.com/story/news/texasregion/2018/12/18/trump-border-wall-gofundme-crowdfunding-campaign-launched-florida-veteran/2352522002/) - can this be earmarked for specific use in constructing the wall?
