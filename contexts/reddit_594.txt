I have a crush on my friend and I'm jealous of his new crush
 I've been low key sad (*very* sad) for the past few days, and I couldn't figure it out. I think it finally hit me today why...

This started a few weeks ago.

My friend and I were messing around during lunch and somehow it ended up with him hardcore flirting with me as a joke. At first, obviously I knew it was a joke and didn't take it seriously. But as it went on for a couple of weeks, I kinda started having some feelings. But, he has a different lunch now, and he told me two days ago that he was hardcore flirting with someone else, and she actually flirted back (I didn't; I'm too awkward to flirt back). I thought nothing of it until, today. My other friend told me that this girl told her that she was dating him. I thought nothing of it again. But, as the day went on, I slowly kept feeling worse, until I talked to him. He said that she reminded him of his ex and was falling for her. I thought that I didn't care, but when I got home, I felt really down and I had no idea why. I'm usually not like that at all. I had some time to think over things, I realized that I was feeling so low and sad for the last two days *after* he told me about this other girl.

I don't know. We're friends, but I have no idea how these feelings developed. And because he's falling for someone else, I feel worse. How do I deal with this? Should I just keep my feelings repressed? I don't know...
