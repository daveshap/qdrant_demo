UK visa delayed for more than usual Guys I need all your suggestions. I applied for UK Visa in August 28, 2018, in Accra Ghana, and in a week or two weeks later received a letter from them stating this below:Dear  .........................Thank you for your visa/entry clearance application which has been received and is under consideration.  We aim to process non settlement applications within 15 working days and settlement applications within 60 working days (unless you have opted for a Priority Visa service).We are unable to resolve your application within these customer service targets, as the processing of your application has not been straightforward. Please be assured that we will continue to progress your application to enable a decision to be made as soon as possible. Please do not attend the application centre until you have been contacted by the VAC. Kind regardsCroydon DMCNow after this email, I didn't hear from them again until last 3 weeks I contacted them on phone which I paid with credit card before talking to me and apologising for the delay and they said this below:Dear................Thank you for contacting UK Visas and Immigration International Contact Centre.Accept our apologies for the delay in processing your applicationI have escalated your case to the relevant department. Please allow 15 working days to pass before contacting UK Visas &amp; ImmigrationInternational Contact Centre again should you not receive any further correspondence.Your patience is much appreciated. Regards,AbdulaiUK Visas and ImmigrationSo after talks with them, is been three weeks after this conversation but still haven'theard from them and today is 19th January, 2019 and applied the unbiased on 28th August, 2019.Now guys I want to withdraw the application and demand a refund of my application on this coming Monday 21st January, 2019. Because they won't process the application and it will keep delaying and I need my passport to travel for a work related in South Africa and Botswana by next month.But also feels I should give them some time and it will come successful, or could it be my passport is lost with them?I need urgent advice.
