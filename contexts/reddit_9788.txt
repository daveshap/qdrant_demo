Junior Undergrad Looking For Student Affairs Graduate School
Hello! 

I'm currently a junior at University of Indianapolis. I'm a theatre major and I work in event services and for the prompt going board. 

Anyways, I'm starting to look for schools. I was told by my advisor and mentor that there are programs that will pay you a stipend and will pay for your housing. How common is this? How do I know if a school offers that? 

Also what are some of the best schools for HESA in the country. I'm mainly interested in Res Life and Student Activities.
