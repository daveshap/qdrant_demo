Would you leave your cushy corporate director of sales job for a cannabis sales position?
I’ll try to keep this brief...

I am a Senior Director of Sales working for a company in a specialty industry. I started working for this company 10 years ago when they were a start up.  I have a been an impact player for them and they have taken very good care of me. We recently sold to a huge company. I am in a prime position on the growth sector of the business. All in all, things are good with the exception of the impending changes coming from the accusations. 

In September I was approached by a cannabis company looking to expand their product offerings in the specialty industry that I am highly skilled and networked in. I would come in as a Vice President of the channel. I would be responsible for building and executing the business plan. The whole company is very much in start up phase. Start up and scaling business is what I know. In my 10 years I have opened 8,500 Retail doors. 

I’ve done my homework. Spent hundreds of dollars to talk with professionals in the space i.e lawyers and industry god fathers. 

I interviewed, they liked me a lot but I told them in November that the timing wasn’t right. Recently they came back and said they would like to keep the conversation going. Saying they believe they can make me very happy. 

Looking for input on this alternative space and how you’d look at leaving a corporate position for something like this. My main ask is going to be equity. 

Where do you see the Cannabis industry going and would you see it as a huge opportunity to get in on the ground floor or no different that any other start up company? 

About me- mid 30’s. Family that I support. No debt outside of a $1,000 mortgage and I have enough in the bank to pay that off and still have plenty to lean back on. Good retirement built up as well. Wife had a job that could support us if needed based on our low level of expenses.
