BASIL EXPOSITION: Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence. There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look. Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
AUSTIN: Thank you, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN: Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION: Be careful.
