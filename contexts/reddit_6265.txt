Surviving the first week in big tech as an introvert
Oh jeez, this is going to be a long, long, long week.

I just got done with my 2nd day at my new tech job. It's a wonderful place to work. Very modern with wonderfully ridiculous benefits (dogs allowed, indoor bike repair, fully stocked fridge, beer on tap in the break room, all that weird 21st century stuff). I like it a lot and I can't wait to dig into my new job.

But the noobie stuff. Oh man. The planned socials, new hire group activities, one on ones with department heads, dozens of people with names I've already forgotten eagerly asking me the same questions all day long, a million suggested clubs and random things I feel expected to do (poker Wednesday, karaoke Thursday, beer Friday, on and on and on). I forgot about all of the stuff they throw at you the first week. And it's magnified by 10000 in an ultra millennial tech company environment. 

Don't get me wrong, it's awesome to work at a place that values employee leisure and wants to make the environment comfortable and friendly. But as an introvert, I've come home and literally just passed out on the couch both days. I'm so exhausted, mentally and physically. I feel so incredibly drained of all of my energy I barely even want to eat dinner, talk to my husband, or pet my dogs. 

Has anyone dealt with this before? Any advice on how introverts can make it through the noob period without feeling completely, utterly overwhelmed by people but also not being standoffish?
