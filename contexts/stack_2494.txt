Replace NULL values in a DATE field? In a date field (TRTMT_DT) in a shapefile, how can I use ArcGIS Pro to replace all Null values with a filler date of '11/11/1111'?For my workflow I can't have any entries in this date field being I see there is no .replace function for non-string fields..For example, in the Calculate Field tool, the following code doesn't work:!TRTMT_DT!.replace('', '11/11/1111')I need this to work outside of an active ArcGIS Pro session, referring to feature classes stored on disk, not referring to layers in the Table Of Contents pane. My intention is to call the process as a model.
