JOEY: Better hurry, Doc. A real story. With a real reporter.
DOC: Joey .... Look, you wanna ride? I can go by your place.
JOEY: You'd lose the money-shots. No. I'll catch a bus. Or a cab. Don't worry about it. Go.
DOC: OK. Be careful. And lighten up. Story of your life could be right round the corner.
JOEY: That is the story of my life.
