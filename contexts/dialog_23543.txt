DAVID: Is this what they always look like?
JULIET: Yes.
ALEX: I wonder how he did it?
JULIET: Did what?
ALEX: I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
JULIET: Alex.
ALEX: What? What's wrong?
JULIET: What are you doing?
ALEX: I'm just looking.
JULIET: Don't.
ALEX: Don't look?
JULIET: No.
ALEX: Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
JULIET: No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
ALEX: It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
JULIET: Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
ALEX: Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
DAVID: I've never seen a dead body before.
JULIET: Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
DAVID: I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
ALEX: Can I show you something?
