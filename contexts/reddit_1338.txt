Does anyone feel anxious about an hour or so before work and then when you begin, your fine?
It’s happening to me right now. I work at target as a seasonal guest advocate and it’s my 4th time working.

Edit: wow time went by fast when I was working at the register. I feel better now lol. I’m on break.
