Losing Deloitte job offer due to missing start date
Hello All,

&#x200B;

I've accepted a graduate job offer at Deloitte UK that starts early September. However, due to UK visa complications I will almost certainly miss the first 2-4 weeks which forms part of their 6 weeks induction/training.

&#x200B;

My question is, how likely is Deloitte to withdraw the job offer because of my missing the initial training/ starting late?

&#x200B;

Also, I will receive my full contract next week, should I sign it straight away to make it less appealing for them to rescind or hold off signing it until they confirm they're happy for me to start late and change the start date on the contract?

&#x200B;

I have already informed both their student recruitment and the immigration team about my situation in writing  and over the phone since March, several times in fact, but didn't get any answer besides that they're informed the "relevant advisor" and will get back to me soon. 

&#x200B;

Any opinions or tips would be very highly appreciated.
