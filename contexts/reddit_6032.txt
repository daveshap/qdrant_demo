Don’t know if this is the right place, I have issues about HR and my job currently.
I work at a gym, before the covid lockdown my mom was diagnosed with cancer and is going through the process of cemo right now. My gym let everyone go home until stay at home order was lifted, my city has slightly lifted the stay at home order and my job is calling me to work. I am afraid to go back because of my mothers immune system and the nature of my work has me talking to people and interacting with them all day. 

Here’s the issue I want to tell my job I can’t go back however my boss has made it sound like I need to go back. I want to call HR and tell them my situation, I just don’t know how to go about it. Can someone please help me write a script or figure out if I’m still able to stay home for these reasons?
