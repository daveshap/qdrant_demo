From experience: Mixed Signals are almost always no intention of actually pursuing a relationship/date. Mixed signals are usually “I like the attention you are giving me” and that’s it.
I am 35 (male) and I wish I had learnt this years ago. Really “learn it” not just know it. 

In my experience about 99% of the times someone throws you constant curve balls that just means they are playing with you. They are not being mean, their brains deceive them into thinking you know what they are doing. 

Learn this: Even when someone texts you randomly at night, or they go out with you but remain at arms distance, or say nice things about how good they feel around you, BUT won’t become romantic, they are just using your attention.

Become romantic means actively seeking or agreeing to be alone with you at night. Feeling confortable with being alone with you. Seeking or allowing touching and lingering of such touch. Obviously kissing and holding hands. 

Romantic doesn’t mean telling you their secrets. Constant texting. Non flirtatious compliments like “you are sweet” or “you make me happy”. Asking you out on things they want to do but no one would do with them...

Curve balls also include texting you but then leave you hanging when you ask for a date and then changing the subject. Telling you about how awesome you are but then dating someone else. Going out with you, **constantly allowing you to pay** but then telling you they have an early morning and then you seeing in their social media they continued the night somewhere else.

Attraction is almost instant in most cases, if someone wants to feel you and touch you they will soon enough. Don’t waste a lot if time waiting for it to happen. If someone is throwing you curve balls just move on.

Good luck.
