LACY: I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
LOIS: Who?
LACY: Clark. He's late again. I can't figure him out.
LOIS: That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
LACY: Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
LOIS: And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
LACY: Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
LOIS: But he's never there.
LACY: Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
