My school’s seniors have started doing different things to keep the grade sane during app season. 🥰
We’ve started doing things like randomly shouting out or complimenting people in the grade who deserve praise. Or (since we are a smaller grade of around 130 people) we have planned grades wide parties with every single person in the grade attending. This is a really hard trying time for all of us and the pressure is really intense. Try to reach out to people you see who are struggling. Even if you don’t really know them. It’ll help a lot. We are all gonna make it through this! But we gotta take care of eachother through all the personal essays, deadlines, interviews, FAFSAs and other nonsense. Class of 2020 family, we got this! Don’t know any of you but I love you and take a breath before worrying about your next supplement 🥰❤️❤️
