My coworkers all went out without me.
I work for a small vet clinic (10 employees including the practice manager and owner, 5 other techs besides myself, and 3 doctors). Last night was the company Christmas party at a local restaurant, it was open bar and super fun. As it was wrapping up and we were all getting ready to go home, the owner asked the other techs if they were still planning on going out for drinks together after.  
  
The other techs are all within 2 years of my age (25) and I thought we were friends, as stupid as that sounds. We've worked together for 2 years and have gotten together outside of work in the past.  
  
They awkwardly said yes, they were going out, and hustled out of the restaurant without looking at me and one other girl. feelsbadman. She gave me a ride home and talked about how bullshit it was.  
  
I'm honestly really hurt. I don't know about you, but I have trouble making friends because all I ever do is work. I thought, at least my coworkers are cool. I just want to be included in their apparent clique because we see each other 40+ hours a week.  
  
I'm so fucking lonely.
