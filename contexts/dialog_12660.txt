MCCLEOD: I'm leaving.
CAVANAUGH: Leaving what?
MCCLEOD: England. There is nothing for me here anymore.
CAVANAUGH: And what do you think you will find in another land?
MCCLEOD: Maybe myself.
CAVANAUGH: Then it's worth the journey.
MCCLEOD: Thank you, Thomas.
CAVANAUGH: For what?
MCCLEOD: For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
CAVANAUGH: I'm sure they will.
MCCLEOD: As friends -- always as friends.
CAVANAUGH: We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
MCCLEOD: That is a thought that doesn't please me.
CAVANAUGH: If it came down to it what would you do?
MCCLEOD: I do not know. I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
