My passport was just changed to married name, but IDL sticker is in my maiden name passport...I am due to travel soon My passport was just changed to married name, but IDL sticker is in my maiden name passport...We are booked to travel on the 18th December.I am currently living in the UK with and Indefinite Leave to Remain visa.It is in my passport with my maiden name.I have applied for British Citizenship and was told by the UK Passport office that I needed to change my Aus passport to my Married name BEFORE they will issue my UK citizenship and passport, otherwise i would have to have them both in my maiden name and would not be able to change it afterwards (why the hell, I don't know, as surely I could then have sent that passport in with a marriage cert and get a new one, but the lady said absolutely not) I also told her I was travelling, and she said to make sure to take my marriage certificate with me and that was fine.So ages ago, i booked the appt in london to go down to get my new passport and the wait was 4 weeks- it just came back.Anyway, while there as he was snipping my passport with the visa, he told me to check with the Home office in the UK as I am travelling at xmas!I have been sitting on hold with the Home office for over 2 hours so far without an answer, but have been googling, only to find that if my name has changed , I must replace my visa with a biometric residence permit if my stay is over 6 mths.So it seems I cannot just use my old passport with the visa at the border to get back in and show my marriage certificate, as i was told by the British passport customer service lady.It takes 6 MONTHS to get a new visa, or \u00a3839 for a fast track one which I cannot afford.I will also have my British passport by then anyway so won't even need one!It seems I am completely stuffed!If i take the risk and try to travel anyway, i don't know what will happen?I am legally allowed to stay here and did nothing wrong and followed advice and now am in a complete pickle!Adding to that my Dad is old and was just in Hospital with an 80% occlusion in his arteries, and not well at all, so if i cannot leave the country for the next 6 mths because of this, i am in trouble if he goes down hill!I don't know what I can do?Does anyone know what the deal is?We are going to lose Thousands of pounds on our booked holiday if I cancel.
