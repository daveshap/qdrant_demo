Why is it unnatural to say \"He is as clever as rude\"? <blockquote>  (1) He is more clever than rude.    (2) ??He is as clever as rude.</blockquote>I've learned (1) is natural and that (2) isn't.(1) means \"He is clever rather than rude\".Then, why can't (2) mean (2b)?<blockquote>  (2b) He is clever as he is rude.</blockquote>In other words, why is (2) unnatural when (2b) is natural?EDIT<br>The question used to ask why (2) is ungrammatical, but people here seem to agree that (2) is grammatical but just might be unnatural in Present-day English.QuestionsI'd like to know why (2) is unnatural, not whether it's unnatural.Also, how natural (1b) is and why?<blockquote>  (1b) He is more clever than he is rude.</blockquote>Addendum The Cambridge Grammar (p 1121) says this is grammatical:<blockquote>  (3) Ed is more old than middle-aged.</blockquote>and that this is not (p 1122):<blockquote>  (3b) *Ed is more old than he is middle-aged.</blockquote>So, the Cambridge Grammar specifically says that the insertion of he is in (3) is what makes it ungrammatical. BTW, the book calls this construction metalinguistic comparison.
