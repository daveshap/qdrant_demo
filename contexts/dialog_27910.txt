MOHAMMED: Cool. What's it do?
HAMMER: Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
MOHAMMED: Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
HAMMER: But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
MOHAMMED: Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
HAMMER: Oh yeah. Take a look.
