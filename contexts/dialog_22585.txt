CARTER: Hmmmm?
RUSS: Don't play bullshit games with me.
CARTER: Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is. He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
CARTER: Oh yeah. The caller was a man. Confident. Had an accent. My guess, Asian. Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
RUSS: Why don't you try the assignment. Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
CARTER: No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
