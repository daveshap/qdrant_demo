Why did pro-status-quo groups call for a boycott of Puerto Rico's statehood referendum?
I've seen many articles than mention the boycott ([example](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN19204O?il=0)), but none seem to answer: why? In doing so, they ensured that the pro-statehood side ended up with a ridiculous majority (97%), even though the turnout was very low (23%).

What exactly does calling for a boycott of the vote accomplish that wouldn't be accomplished by encouraging those who support your cause to vote?

Edit: I should clarify that this referendum had *three* options: statehood, independence, and status quo. *Both* independence and status-quo groups called for a boycott, leading to the lopsided result.
