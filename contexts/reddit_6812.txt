I think I just annoyed a job recruiter who was recruiting me for my dream position, need some insight if I broke protocol when dealing with the recruiter
Hey Guys, so I'm having a bit of anxiety and I just wanted some insight into how job recruiters think and function to either come to terms I ***forked*** up or to put my mind at ease.

So I got contacted last week by a job recruiter with a position at a MAJOR company with a job that looks like it was written for my skillset and experience. Even the recruiter mentioned this and told me at the time that he has high hopes that I'd get the position and that he'd most likely have an answer by Friday. He even said he loved my personality and thought I'd fit right into the company. 

Friday comes along and I hadn't heard anything from him so I sent an email to follow up. Problem is, I found out on Monday that my website/email hosting site has been having authentication issues where all emails lack a certificate and they get filtered as spam by most email clients, so my email didn't go through. 

So today I called to follow up and got the recruiting agency's front desk and asked to speak to the recruiter. He seemed pretty annoyed that I had called, confirmed that he didn't get my email, said that he had already submitted my resume and application and was still waiting to hear back, but kept acting annoyed as if I had broken some kind of protocol by calling him.

Here's a few questions I had about the process:

* Is this a reason for him to pull my resume and portfolio from this position?
* Is my potential job jeopardized because of this interaction?
* If so, then is there anything I can do to remedy this situation?

Thanks!
