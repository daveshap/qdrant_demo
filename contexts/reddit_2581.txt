How do you overcome GPA gatekeeping?
(Posting on behalf of my husband)

My husband stuggled through college, but he made it, graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. The problem was his final GPA was a 2.5 (lots of events happened that lead to the final number. No excuses being made here though).

No entry level mechanical engineering jobs would even interview him, siting his GPA was too low. Fast forward a few years and he’s had a job as a auto cad drafter & auto cad tech. We thought, ok he has some job experience, let’s try applying to low level jobs at the engineering firms. Maybe now the GPA won’t be an issue.

He applied to a hiring event at an engineering firm. His sister knew the guy running the event, he spoke with him before the event and heard they were desperate to get people in. He wasn’t even allowed into the hiring event because his GPA is a mandatory field and they automatically kick out anything lower than a 3.0.

Does this mean his GPA will always keep him from becoming a mechanical engineer? How do you get a foot in the door to even be interviewed if places don’t even look at your experience because of GPA? Should he be thinking of a new career path? 

Thank you in advance for any advice!
