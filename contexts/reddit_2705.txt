Sounds like a joke, but isn't-- Ever since I turned 13 I have had constant gas. To top it off, I have a condition that causes me to have chronic bad breath even if I remove tonsils. I have avoided work due to this. Am I as un-hireable as I feel?
I hate being around people due to knowing I'm burdening them with my chronic gas and bad breath combo, so even though I have extroverted desires, I have become short-worded and avoidant for the sake of other people's comfort.

Having tried many diets and having visited gastroenterologists who gave me tests and said there's no physical cure (though they did give me pills which did not work, and I've also tried many OTC solutions), I don't think I can fix the gas part-- and even if I did, the other condition causes me to smell very bad anyway (bad breath no matter what. not tonsils-related).

Peers and my own family have constantly informed me of myself/my breath reeking, and steps I've taken to try to fix it have all failed. I feel like a walking cloud of grossness. I don't want to torture anyone by, like, being in a cubicle next to them or sitting next to them at a work meeting. I've already had the experience of sitting in class and having kids cover their noses by me, gossip about my smell (really), and request to change their nearby assigned seats over time like a game of Musical Chairs.

Long story short, because of this, I've basically- entirely withdrawn myself from society. I live alone and have not bothered to pursue a career due to this problem. Outcast by smell! What should I do. Am I wrong to not try? At one point I considered applying for disability, but I don't think my case qualifies, and when I talked to a therapist about this I felt very silly. 

Thanks for listening; would never talk this long to someone IRL! ;)
