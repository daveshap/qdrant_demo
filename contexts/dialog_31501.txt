WALTER: What's her name?
ROBIN: Ms. Kramer.
WALTER: Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
ROBIN: I can't.
WALTER: Yes you can, Robin.
WALTER: You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
ROBIN: What will happen if I do?
WALTER: Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
ROBIN: But will he... ?
WALTER: Your daddy will always love you.
ROBIN: How do you know?
WALTER: I know because... it's just something I know.
ROBIN: I don't want to hurt my daddy.
WALTER: Robin, listen to me.
