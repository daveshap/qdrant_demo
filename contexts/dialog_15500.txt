LYSSA: I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
COLWYN: I don't have to go through with it either.
LYSSA: You don't understand. I'm just so <u>relieved</u>. I was <u>sure</u> you'd turn out to be short and fat and gimpy.
COLWYN: Oh. That. I know what you mean. I had nightmares all week.
LYSSA: Me too.
COLWYN: Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
LYSSA: Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
COLWYN: That's worse.
LYSSA: You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
COLWYN: Well, you're beautiful.
LYSSA: You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
COLWYN: If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
LYSSA: I have no intention of getting used to it.
LYSSA: Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
COLWYN: <u>What</u>?
LYSSA: We're almost married.
COLWYN: We're not married <u>yet</u>.
LYSSA: Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
