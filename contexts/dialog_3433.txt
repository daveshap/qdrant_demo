BELOVED: You don't sit with me!!
SETHE: Baby, don't be like that.
BELOVED: You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
SETHE: Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
BELOVED: I had another dream last night. The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
SETHE: Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
BELOVED: You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
SETHE: Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
BELOVED: You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
SETHE: That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
