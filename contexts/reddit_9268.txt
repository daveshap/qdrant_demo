Anyone else frequently check their bank account thinking money will just disappear?
I think it’s just because I had an automatic payment every week for a year, it was extremely stressful. Now I have a habit of checking my bank account 3 times a day just making sure nothing put me in the negative. I haven’t had any automatic payments set up for 6 months but it’s still a habit. To be honest I want a new bank account that isn’t linked to anything so I don’t have to worry.
