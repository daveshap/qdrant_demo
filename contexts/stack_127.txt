Mac Mini TAOP--124 Hardware Test I recently bought a Mac Mini which I knew was missing the hard drive, so easy fix right? Whenever I start the Mac the fans are running really high and the odd thing is I can only start the Mac in safe mode otherwise it will go into a boot loop.I did a PRAM/SMC reset, but no result. I performed an Apple Hardware Test and I got an error:4SNS/1/C0000008 TAOP-- 124: Ambient Temperature SensorI tried to connect an other Mac Mini's sensor but that didn't work either. The thing is, the Mac runs from an external harddrive connected to the Mac through SATA to USB. It is missing the internal SATA. Can it have something to do with the missing SATA? Or has anyone else fixed this issue before?
