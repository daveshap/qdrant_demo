MFA in Industrial Design - Worth it?
I found MFA ID to be the ideal degree for me, as I have a bachelor's degree in engineering in Computer Science, and I wanna do something related to designing, like Graphics Designing, UX designing, Game Dev, etc. 

However, a lot of people online have expressed their hatred for the MFA degree as a whole, stating that it is both expensive, and a waste of time. 

I am planning to pursue an MFA ID degree in Canada, please tell me if it is worth it.
