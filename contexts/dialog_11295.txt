KAREN: You son of a bitch. She's been here.
HENRY: What are you talking about?
KAREN: Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
HENRY: Jezuz Christ!
KAREN: You want her to visit you? Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
HENRY: What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
