BARBATUS: You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you. Whatsamatter, kid? Leave a girl behind?
Z: Yeah. Well -- no. She's kind of playing hard to get. As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable. So, what's on the schedule? A brisk walk? a foraging expedition?
BARBATUS: No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Z: Attack? But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
