This was the best year of my life.
This is a selfish 'coronavirus is ruining my plans' post.

I finally moved away from home, moved to college. I escaped my broken home!!

I lived with and became really close with the coolest, most intelligent and motivated people i've known. This was my only year I was going to live with all of them in the dorms. I was doing good in school and I got an internship over summer! I was getting really close an awesome girl and was looking forward to spending the next 2 months living literally on the same floor as her, whether or not things ever escalated between us.

Now everything has fucked up. Because of coronavirus the rest of the academic year will be conducted online and we all have to move back home. I have to move back with my parents who hate me and somehow have to succeed in upper division engineering classes all online in an environment I really don't like.

Things were AWESOME. I was HAPPY. I've been happy before but I've never felt so fulfilled with life. Now it's all being taken away from me by powers out of my control. I'm mad that there's no one to blame and no one to be mad at, its just a quirk of biology doing its thing and we just happen to be collateral damage.

Oddly, the one comforting thing is that so many other people are also going through so much shit because of this stupid fucking virus. I know that sounds selfish but that's been helping me get through the days.

I just want to wake up tomorrow and have this all be a fever dream.
