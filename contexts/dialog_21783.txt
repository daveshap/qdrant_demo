JAKE: Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
JOEY: When?
JAKE: You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
JOEY: Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
JAKE: Why didn't you tell me about it?
JOEY: It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
JAKE: Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
JOEY: No, I just told you what happened.
JAKE: Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
JOEY: Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
JAKE: Well, I heard some things.
