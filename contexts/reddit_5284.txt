Just got demoted
To put it simply, I am an auto mechanic by trade.

I got offered a manager in training position in a company. They put me in two problematic stores. One store, when learning policy and such, the person training me looked at my pay stub when I left it out while talking to a customer, and refused from that day forth to train me. I then got transferred to another store to help. When I got to this store, it was BAD. Technicians lying around doing nothing. No safety policy. Doing bad, dangerous work. Since I have gotten there, sales have gone up, usually we meet numbers and bonus, and there is a noticeable improvement in the motivation and the work quality since I started there. 

However, today,my regional manager told me I am not progressing fast enough (I was originally given a time frame of 3 months,but now it is apparently 2 months). He took me out of the MIT program, took away my bonus pay to meet what I originally wanted, but I am expected to do the same work. 

To add to the fire, my other assistant manager transferred without my regional knowing. Now I do not have that extra little bonus but am expected to work six days a week, some days alone. 

I am a bit annoyed that I got demoted especially since I was put in two problem stores. I see that these sort of things (constant transfers and demotions) happen in this region, to the point where customers and technicians have an issue with it. What is your best advice for me?

Tl;dr Got job as a manager in training. Get thrown to the wolves in problematic stores. Regional demotes me and now expects me to do same work but with an extra day cuz someone left. I think it's unfair because the store I'm in frankly sucks.
