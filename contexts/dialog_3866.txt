HEATHER: Nice tent.
COTTER: Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
HEATHER: Never would've guessed.
COTTER: So where the hell am I going to sleep?
HEATHER: If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
COTTER: I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
HEATHER: What movies?
COTTER: Ask me what I don't have.
HEATHER: What I never could figure about the movie?
COTTER: What?
HEATHER: Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
COTTER: Yeah?
HEATHER: No fucking.
COTTER: No.
HEATHER: Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
COTTER: No sense at all. I'm a little stressed.
HEATHER: Try a long walk.
DOMINI: Oooh. Oooh.
NICK: Ah, Domini?
DOMINI: What?
NICK: You planning on sleeping out there?
DOMINI: Not planning on sleeping at all.
