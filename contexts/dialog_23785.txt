JACK: Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
PHYLLIS: They're just leftovers.
JACK: Is it chicken?
PHYLLIS: I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
MILES: It was a surprise, Mom.
PHYLLIS: And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
MILES: You talked to Wendy?
PHYLLIS: Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
MILES: Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
PHYLLIS: Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
MILES: Uh-huh. I'll be right back.
