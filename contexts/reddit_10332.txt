i really wanna hang myself rn. Im not going to do it, but i really want to
im not feeling good this morning so im cutting up my leg rn ): but it happens u know


sometimes things suck and u gotta cutt

(i already know cutting is bad so please dont mindlessly spew taht out in the comments. i also know how to take care of my cuts)

~~~~~~~

*edit: hey, i noticed the comments have been getting spicy and i would like to put my thoughts here instead of repeating them in the comments-

please DONT comment something along the lines of "i care about you" or "i love you". we are strangers on the internet. you dont know me, i dont know you, we dont know them. that means nothing to the receiving end.

please DO share your own experiences and how they may compare or contrast! i and others would much rather like to hear that we are not alone. theres also no harm in wishing others well rather than telling them things WILL get well.


also, please dont be toxic to each other. i can handle toxic comments, but idk other people's headspaces right now and id rather this post be a chill space than a nasty one. 

thank you.*
