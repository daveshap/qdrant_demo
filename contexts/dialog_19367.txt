CRAIG: Who is that?
DAY-DAY: That's the sister.
CRAIG: Yo know what? I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
DAY-DAY: I know what 'cha thinking. I thought the same thing. But it can't happen.
CRAIG: Why?
DAY-DAY: Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy. And I'm just trying to keep the peace. We moved out here to get away from that shit.
