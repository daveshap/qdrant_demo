Errors with Append tool 000594 I am trying to No_Test append a polygon feature class to another polygon feature class. Both fc's are located in the same geodatabase. I am using the Append tool with ArcGIS 10.2.I'm getting two errors, but to focus the question on one--I keep getting Error 000594: Input Feature 1L falls outside of output geometry domains.I recall having this issue before and being able to fix it with environmental settings, but the error still occurs with the following set:<blockquote>  Output Coordinates: Same as input    Processing Extent: Union of inputs    M and Z values have  been disabled (although there are no M or Z values for either fc. I've read that if the fc was created in ArcGIS 9.x or earlier, it may have issues with M or Z values.)    Geodatabase Advanced: Maintain Spacial Index has been checked. Output M and Z are same as input.</blockquote>Any suggestions on what else I should be troubleshooting?
