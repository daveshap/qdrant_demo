ADDISON: Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
EVE: Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
ADDISON: Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
EVE: Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
ADDISON: Some plain soda. Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
EVE: That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
ADDISON: We're?
EVE: Lloyd and I.
