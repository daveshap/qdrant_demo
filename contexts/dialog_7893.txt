ED: So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
LORETTA: Perhaps a small amount of money. How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
ED: For this one, we need $60,000.
LORETTA: That's all?? That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
ED: Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
LORETTA: Oh my, this is very interesting. Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
ED: Oh, of course!! There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
LORETTA: Hmm. Those sound kind of small. Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton. I'd sure like to play her.
