How can you ask about the security of your employment?
I have fears and some actual reasons to believe my employment may be furloughed or laid off entirely. I want to ask my HR about the possibilities so I can prepare myself financially and mentally. I work for a very small company (less then 10 employees) in WV that provides repair services to electronic coal/salt mining equipment.
