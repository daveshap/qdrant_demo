Can you guys help someone out on this post?
Hey everyone I don’t really know if this is exactly how this subreddit operates, but I found a post of someone struggling with depression by happenstance, and it barely got any attention. To be honest, I don’t think I’m anywhere near the right person to be giving people advice and I fear any attempts I make will come across very poorly. If any of you can give this person some advice or kind words it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
