How do i gracefully handle a coworker who blurts out unreasonable deliverables as being easily achievable during meetings without making him out to be a fool?
Have a coworker who blurts out unreasonable deliverables on the reg during meetings. It would be fine if it was just him digging his own grave(which he does constantly). The problem is when he does this with the work of other people. 

Lets name him "Blurt"

**Meeting about website & app**

Me: i think we might need to invest 10,000usd minimum in order to properly create version 1 of our web app 

Blurt:  Definitely possible with 2500 usd. I know a guy and a few companies.

[When i asked him later (giving the benefit of the doubt. cost saving is wonderful after all) he said what he meant by he knew someone was that he talked to someone on the phone once. When he said he knew companies, he just heard of them. FML. ]

**Discussing SEO blog content**

Marketing manager: We've all agreed on a budget of 50-150 usd per high quality article but ive found a freelancer who can do 20 usd per post with a reasonably good portofolio

Blurt: Oh thats too expensive! We can get cheaper. Its just writing.

So on and so forth. 

For the sake of team cohesion and morale i dont want to make a fool of him yet id like to bring him back to reality a bit. 

Whats your advice?

Hes generally a good person, just a bit insecure therefore has an ego.
