NELS: Just three questions. The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
ETTA: Tried to. Defaulted on their payments.
NELS: Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
ETTA: A thousand.
NELS: So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it? If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
ETTA: Is that your third question?
NELS: It is.
ETTA: You done your math right.
