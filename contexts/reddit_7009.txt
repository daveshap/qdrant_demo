How to find out if my company is going to lay off one of it's call centers soon?
I work for a fortune 500 company that has had a call center running for the last 10 years, and my company has been renting the building as its on the land that another company owns. There were no renovations being done during these 10 years of operations up until this last year. They have been redoing everything in the building, and I mean almost everything. Not only that, but there were three other departments in this building, who over the last year all have been laid off except for my department now. No one suspects that they will be closing the contact center except for me. 

Does anyone have an idea how I can find this out? I was thinking of calling the company that we lease the building from, and act like I am an interested leaser. but I have no clue how to go about this. What are your thoughts?
