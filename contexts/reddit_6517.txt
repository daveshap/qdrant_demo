Switched shifts for a coworker and she didn’t show up for my shift, what to do?
This girl is a headache to work with. First, she didn’t tell my manager that she switched with me. So I had to apologize to my manager for that as he seemed annoyed already. He said it was fine that we switched, just make sure she showed up to my shift.. and she didn’t. 

I already worked my shift from last night 11pm-7am and went back to work her shift (12n-7pm). My replacement came in fine. He texted me that he waited until midnight and the coworker I switched shifts with never came in. 

I’m honestly annoyed because she has made me look bad twice now... how should I approach this? 

Edit: can the mods of r/jobs lock this post? I’m getting unwanted attention from the buffoons over at r/MGTOW. This wasn’t a gender related issue, but they think it is.
