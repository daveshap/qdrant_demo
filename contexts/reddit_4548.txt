Almost killed myself a few weeks ago so I quit my meds and tried to make personal changes but I just feel miserable all the time.
I’m fine I think  I just put a gun to my head which caused me to loose faith in my meds which I promptly quit. I just want to feel normal but I always feel sad instead depression is such a bitch.

Edit. Thanks for the kind words I wish I could say I was feeling better but that’s never the case lol. Thanks though it does help.
