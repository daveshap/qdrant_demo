How do I call a forecast that is both accurate and precise? How do I call a forecast (more precisely, a forecasting rule) that is both accurate and precise?<br>Is there a word that expresses both properties combined?I do not mean the forecasting rule is perfect, i.e. it does not have to produce forecasts that always perfectly coincide with their respective targets, but its accuracy is good (low bias) and its precision too (low variance).
