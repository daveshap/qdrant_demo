JULIE: Why are you doing this to me?
WILL: Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
JULIE: I trusted you.
WILL: We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
JULIE: ...Why?
WILL: Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
