SHERMIN: Hello George.
FOX: Shermin...
SHERMIN: What's all this for?
FOX: We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
SHERMIN: We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
FOX: Washington thinks it's too late for that.
SHERMIN: I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
FOX: You're not hearing me.
SHERMIN: You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
FOX: We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
SHERMIN: That's the chance we have to take.
FOX: No, we don't.
SHERMIN: Then you're going to have to do it without me.
FOX: You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
SHERMIN: You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
