I have nothing holding me down, where should I work?
I have a BA in psychology and I'm a 27 year old male. I live about an hour away from NYC. I know the climate for jobs is weird now but I have nothing holding me to where I live. I recently worked in New Zealand for a year and it was every part as good as it sounds. I have no significant other, my family is doing fine, I live at a friends so I don't have a lease. I'm curious, what would you do if you had nothing holding you down? I plan on going somewhere to experience a different way of life and possibly culture. Idea?
