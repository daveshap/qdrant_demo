QGIS: Intersect rasterdata with vectorline I am new to QGIS. My aim is to be able to get information of the height at any point on my vector line. My raster is a map with height information in the format geotiff. The vector layer is in the shape format.I tried to intersect them but it wouldn't work, I guess because they are not the same format. I also tried to vectorize the raster layer and use the plugin refFunction and geomwithin but it wouldn't work either.
