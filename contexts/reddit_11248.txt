I just had to kill a baby rabbit
My dog just caught a baby rabbit but instead of killing it he just injured it and left it for dead. I'm sure he just wanted to play with it and was surprised when he actually caught it and didn't know what to do. I couldn't just let it lay there and suffer so I did one of the hardest things I've done; I took a big brick and killed him and now I feel terrible. I can't stop picturing the poor mom looking for her tiny baby :(
