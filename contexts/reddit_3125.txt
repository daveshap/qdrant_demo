How to deal with aggressive know-it-all co-worker?
What does it mean if coworker's first response to something they don't understand is ALWAYS "this is wrong"?   And let's just say that there's a lot that he doesn't understand.

I'm constantly put on the defensive, and I fear co-worker is making me look bad.  

I've also never had a conversation that he didn't aggressively brag during.  Whatever the topic he relays it back to his resume, "years of experience," and "degree in X.". Fine things to say for a job interview, but he was hired over a year ago and still talks about his resume every conversation.  His skills do look better on the resume than in real life.  

He'll say things that are objectively wrong, but sound technical so no one but me understands that it's b.s.  

He's very protective of his work and hiding it from the review/QA of others.  But he also sticks his nose in other people's work, micromanages his reports, and tries to micromanage people who aren't his reports.  

Management doesn't get into the technical details.  How can I make them see my coworker for what he is?
