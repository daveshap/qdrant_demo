LEE: Come on, Will.
WILL: What's the matter?! You mad at me?
LEE: No. Why?
WILL: Nothin'. She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more. Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies. You got some money?
LEE: Let's stay here, Will.
WILL: What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
