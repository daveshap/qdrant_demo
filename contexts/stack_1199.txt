Why doesn't simple recovery model support log backup or tail log backup? Lets say there is a crash then we can use the full backup and a tail log backup - because if there was checkpoint then data would already be written to the database data file and flushed from the transaction log. Where as if there was no checkpoint yet then logs will still be there in the transaction log file. So is recovery possible in this recovery model?
