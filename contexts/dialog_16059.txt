HOPPIN' BOB: All in, boss!
DILLARD: Move it out.
HOPPIN' BOB: Movin' it out, boss.
CLAUDE: You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
RAY: New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
CLAUDE: I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
RAY: Absolutely. The map is very clear.
CLAUDE: Let me take a look at that map.
CLAUDE: You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
RAY: Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
CLAUDE: You drew this?!
RAY: I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
CLAUDE: That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
