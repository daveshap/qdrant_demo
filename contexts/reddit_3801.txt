Try to enjoy being single and make the most out of it
I had been single for a while, and I thought it was the worst thing ever. I was full of doubts about ever being able to find somebody, about my appearance, and even about my desirability to the opposite sex in general. I just wanted to have something going on with someone so badly that I feel like I missed out on the life that was going on around me. I hated the situation and myself for being in it so much that I didnt enjoy the quality time I was spending with friends and family. 

Well now I have something going on with someone, and while I really like this, I look back to the time I was single and realize it wasn't that bad. Clearly if someone likes me now, then all of those doubts I had were untrue, I just couldnt see it at the time.  It's not that I want to go back to being single, but I feel like I wasted a large chunk of my life just feeling sorry for myself, and well, life is finite and I wont get that time back. 

I know it gets frustrating and depressing at times, but understand that this is just as much a part of your life as are the times you're in a relationship.  You learn just as much from being single as you do when you're in a relationship. And above all, most importantly, if you can let go and make the most with what you've got, it will make you the type of person that's more attractive and will help you get into a relationship in the first place. 

Yeah, maybe this is survivorship bias. Maybe I wouldnt feel this this way if I never met anyone.  But its given me a lot of perspective, and I thought I'd share because I felt like it might be helpful to a lot of you.
