DANA: Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
JANOSZ: You know, you are really doing very good work here. I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
DANA: Thank you, Janosz. I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
JANOSZ: We'll be very sorry to lose you. Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
DANA: Actually, I'm not eating lunch today. I have an appointment. In fact, I'd better go.
JANOSZ: Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do. Do I have bad breath or something?
DANA: I'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.
JANOSZ: Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
