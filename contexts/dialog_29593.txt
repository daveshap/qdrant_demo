FLYNN: So...how's the world of serious science?
LORA: Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
FLYNN: Whew. You never were much for small talk. She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
LORA: Flynn!
ALAN: Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
LORA: You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
FLYNN: Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
ALAN: You did break in.
FLYNN: Tried to. Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
ALAN: Are you embezzling?
FLYNN: Embezzling" is such an ugly word
ALAN: I don't get it.
FLYNN: You haven't told him?
FLYNN: Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called... ...Space Paranoids.
ALAN: You invented Space Paranoids?
FLYNN: Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now
ALAN: Senior exec.
FLYNN: Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
ALAN: I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
FLYNN: Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
