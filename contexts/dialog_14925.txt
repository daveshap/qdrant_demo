GARRISON: Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias. You know that. There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
JUDGE HAGGERTY: I call'em as I see'em, Jim. I'm ruling it inadmissible.
GARRISON: That's our case!

GARRISON: I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
JUDGE HAGGERTY: Well, I am saying it. Bring in the jury.
