am i overly sensitive?
it was my birthday recently and my friends and i regularly use snapchat as our form of communication 

if you understand how snapchat works you’d know you have the option to post on your stories with other ppl viewing it and normally, when it was someone’s birthday my friends and i will post the person on our stories wishing them a hbd but when my birthday came along none of my friends did so.. :( but i continued to do it for them 

am i just being over dramatic? and overly sensitive? or do i have a right to somewhat sad and hurt?
