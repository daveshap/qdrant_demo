Are there any documented instances of forest mismanagement in the areas affected by California's ongoing wildfires?

There are two large ongoing wildfires in California. The Camp Fire has covered more than [156 square miles](https://abc7news.com/maps-a-look-at-the-camp-fire-in-butte-county-and-other-california-fires/4656293/) (404 km^2 ) between Chico and the Plumas National Forest in Northern California and remains only 20% contained. Meanwhile, the Woolsey Fire covers 109 square miles (282 km^2 ) in the area around Thousand Oaks and Malibu west of Los Angeles and is 0% contained.

President Trump has stated that the fires are due to [forest mismanagement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/trump-mismanagement-forests-blame-california-fires-181110085539030.html) on California's part, and has threatened to cut off federal funding if that is not remedied.

However, a spokesperson for CA Governor Jerry Brown and the president of California Professional Firefighters have both stated that nearly [60% of California's forests are under federal control](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/10/trump-blames-gross-mismanagement-wildfires-leave-trail-death-destruction-california/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.70481f8af284), including a majority of the areas affected by the fires, and that the state has increased its funding for forest services while the federal government has cut back funding for it.

Experts have blamed the unusually intense fires on excessive build-up of flammable material due to [decades of fire suppression](https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/Trump-on-California-s-Camp-Fire-Forest-13380388.php) as well as "rising temperatures and longer spells of dry weather."

1. Could the conditions allowing for these fires been prevented by better forest management?
1.  Are there any documented instances of waste, fraud, or abuse within forest services at either the CA state or federal level?
1. Could any forest services in the areas affected by the fire be characterized as negligent, inefficient, underfunded, or otherwise poorly executed? If, so by whom?
1. What is the legality of refusing federal payments to states as a punishment for poor state-run environmental services? Is there precedent for it?
