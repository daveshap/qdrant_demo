Her, it's all I think about any more. I can't stop it.
I can't sleep, I can hardly eat. I never thought it would happen to me like this. I thought breaks ups were easy and over with in a few days to weeks. It's been 2 months and it is ruining me more and more each and everyday. I live 4 hours away now, I'll never see her again in my entire life, I'm not going back there. I think about the guys she's with, what she's doing with them. Its destroying me. I can't focus on what needs to be done to improve my life. I can't keep myself distracted long enough. Nothing works, I just want to run away. I regrettably sent her a text message basically telling her what kind of hell I am going through and how much I miss her. Big fucking mistake I know but I'm weak. I know she doesn't want a commitment relationship, she wants to sleep around, do things with any dude she can find. I should realize that's she's just some sloozy that I should never have fallen for any way. Did she really ever mean those things she said to me? Where did it all go wrong? Was it me? Had to be me right? Maybe I was too clingy? Was I? Maybe it was her not wanting to commit. 

Whatever it was is driving me up the wall. I can't come back from this, not any time soon. Maybe if I had more friends around here it'd be easier. I have none here, I have none online. I'm all alone in the nightmare and nowhere to go. I'm not suicidal and killing myself over this would be ridiculous, but I want out so bad. I wish I could go back to when we met and just walked away. She had nothing good for me. 

Im not even re reading this for grammar and spelling. It was hard enough to type I'm not looking at it again. Thanks for reading if you did.
