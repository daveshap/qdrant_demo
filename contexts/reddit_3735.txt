Dating for a beginner?
What are some dating stages and what information should you share during those? 

I understand that it depends on how comfortable you feel with them, etc but I'm supposing there are boundaries. I.e. not sharing your whole life story on the first date, not asking them to move in after the second date, etc. These are extreme examples and common sense that goes for anyone you meet for the first time, I suppose but I'd specifically like to focus on dating boundaries. How long is casual dating and after how long can it be considered serious? I suppose it depends on if you've decided to become exclusive but is there an average timeframe? 

I've never dated before and would like to be mindful of it. 

Also please list the green, yellow and red flags for dating men and women. What are some things that you should discuss/talk about to find out if your views, goals, etc. are compatible? 

Also, after dating, are there relationship stages? If so, what are they? What are the boundaries? What are some relationship flags?

Sharing any lessons learned while dating /being in a relationship would also be appreciated.


Edit - Thank you for all the upvotes and comments. Although I understand that the experiences are different, follow your gut, etc. Please refrain from offering generic advice. 

Even if everyone has different experience, expectations, etc. I believe there will be a set of red/green flags or experiences that are common to most if not all. So please focus on sharing those. Imagine you little brother/sister that has never dated before is about to start dating and you're giving them pointers based on your experience. 

Thank you once again, kind strangers.
