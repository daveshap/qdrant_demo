JAM: So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
PRIEST: That's it?
JAM: Yeah.
PRIEST: Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
JAM: No.
PRIEST: Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
JAM: Beth? I can't believe it.
BETH: Believe it.
