Constant Job Rejection Feel Like Dating to Anyone Else?
I graduated into the recession and couldn’t find a job, setting me back a bit in terms of job experience in my (dying) field of journalism. I couldn’t even get an unpaid internship then. Now there’s younger, more hands-on experienced individuals that are in higher demand. I’m so tired of filling out applications, having phone interviews, and multiple face-to-face interviews, only to be passed over. It’s so frustrating. If I wanted this much rejection, I’d get back on Tinder. How do you fellow job-searchers keep your spirits up in the face of constant disappointment?
