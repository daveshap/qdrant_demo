YOUNG WOMAN: I'm sorry.
TOM: Are you okay?
YOUNG WOMAN: Yes, I'm sorry.
TOM: Don't be silly. What are you sorry about?
YOUNG WOMAN: The way you were looking at me, I just went.
TOM: I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
YOUNG WOMAN: Uh-huh.
TOM: ...that way we have someplace to go when we cut. And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.
