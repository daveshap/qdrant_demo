Would virtual particles \"dissolve\" objects given enough time? Suppose for the sake of argument that you have an object in a vacuum. According to QFT, virtual particle pairs pop in and out of existence constantly. Given enough time, would it be reasonable to expect the object to be broken down by the occasional stray antiparticle? I'm sure it would take billions of years, but would it be possible?
