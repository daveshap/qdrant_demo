SAM: Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
KURTZMAN: Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards! Ow! Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
SAM: You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
KURTZMAN: What?
SAM: Drive out to Mrs Buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
