CHARLIE: Oh great...hey - Winstons?
MICHAEL: For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
CHARLIE: OK, ok...
MICHAEL: Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
CHARLIE: No...I'll be ok for a week.
MICHAEL: You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
CHARLIE: Nope...
MICHAEL: Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
CHARLIE: Look...I don't know. What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something? Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head. Right?
MICHAEL: I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
MICHAEL: ...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me? I think you should be, you know that.
CHARLIE: Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
MICHAEL: I know that Charlie but look at my side. You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him. What happens if this kid don't pay me? I gotta collect from you? I don't want to do that. I made a deal with him not you, right?
CHARLIE: You're right. You're right. Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts. You know that.
MICHAEL: I don't know that. That's what I'm telling you.
CHARLIE: Michael, believe me. You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes. I vouched for him and he'll come through. I promise. I'll talk to him and straighten him out. Don't worry, OK?
MICHAEL: OK.
