Dating conversation tip: practice "deep listening" — here's how
This is a tip for people who struggle with conversation from time to time.

Try to practice "deep listening" — this means allowing people to say what’s on their mind and listening to it with real curiosity and attention, without waiting for your turn to talk. Then ask questions that reflect back what the person is saying.

It may seem obvious to some, but others have the tendency to start thinking about their response while the other person is still talking. If you focus on listening rather than crafting your own response, conversation will come more naturally.

Do you have any tips for better listening and conversation flow?
