JOEL: You said...
CLEMENTINE: I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
JOEL: Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
CLEMENTINE: I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
JOEL: Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
VOICE-OVER: But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
CLEMENTINE: But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
VOICE-OVER: And I just liked you so much.
CLEMENTINE: You did? You liked me?
JOEL: You know what I did.
CLEMENTINE: Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
JOEL: You said --
CLEMENTINE: I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
JOEL: And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
