Expecting an offer... "we've chosen another candidate". I'm so confused.
I interviewed for a company on Tuesday and it went really well to the point that they were trying to sell me the company/position. I didn't really have to work that hard in talking about myself.

That evening I got a phone call asking me to come back for an "informal interview" the following day. I drove 2 hours to get to this interview. Again, everything went well to the point that they told me about the other candidates, said me I'd fit in well, and "give me a day to put an offer together".

I receive an email saying I'd hear back from them early next week as the timeline was originally by the end of the week.

Today I got an email thanking me for my time but they have decided to go with another candidate.

I'm so confused and pissed. I was expecting an offer and delayed another company because of this. Should I ask what happened? Or just ignore it. My instinct is to ignore it as it won't change anything, but I also want to find out what the hell went wrong.
