JOHN: Where's the safe?
GRACE: I don't know.
JOHN: You don't know? Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
GRACE: I'm not sure where it is. Not exactly. I never saw it. I just heard him talk about it.
JOHN: Oh, that's great. We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
GRACE: Don't yell at me!
