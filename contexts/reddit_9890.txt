I'm considering a masters in CSP. Is it a good move?
I'm a current high school teacher looking at doing a masters degree in CSP. My question is is it even worth getting? Are the jobs similar in pay? I know I want to move into some sort of advising/counseling roll at some point I just can't decide if I should pursue it at the college level or go through all the classes and licenses for the high school level.
