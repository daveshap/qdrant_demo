BETTY: Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
OLIVER: Judge Wright? Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
BETTY: Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
OLIVER: Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
BETTY: Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
