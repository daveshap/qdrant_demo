So, I Heard Colleges Consider SAT Scores Within 50 Points Range to Be Essentially the Same...
I have scored 1250 on the SAT, so that equates to 1300, which then equates to 1350, which also will equate to 1400...

By this logic, I have a phat **1600** at my hands.

I assume I am now competitive enough for St.Anford.
