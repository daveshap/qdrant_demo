Can someone help?
I'm high school student and my "headroom" teacher (P. E teacher) is kinda strange. Altough he is young and P. E teacher he is kinda closed and when you ask him something he answer you few second later. I'm not used  to that standoff and cold relation. All my teachers in ex school were kind and sociable, all in all we had relation like we were friends and not somekind of authority. So if somebody knows some way we could bond and have warmer and closer relation i would be thankfull. I don't have to say that schools are in the same city of about 60 000 habitants
