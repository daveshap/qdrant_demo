I think I may have found my ideal lab! Is there anything else I need to consider?
I’m currently in my third rotation (out of a possible 5) of a Biomedical Sciences PhD program. My first two rotations didn’t feel like the right fit. The first was a tiny lab with a somewhat micro-managey PI, and the second was too high-risk in its research focus and had very long graduation times. 

My third rotation, which just started a week ago, felt like it clicked immediately. It’s a huge lab (like 40 people, around 15 are grad students) with a strong social bond. Extremely well funded and a very translational focus (my preference). The PI is supportive, obviously a bit busy, but according to his students he makes enough time for them, plus they all help each other deal with issues. All the students I’ve talked to seem very happy and have good work-life balance. Most students graduate with at least one high-impact first-author paper, often C/N/S. My project is fascinating as well.

What are some other factors I should consider before committing to this lab? So far the only downsides I’ve found are that the lab is pretty crowded (4 students are graduating soon so that should help) and there’s some occasional interpersonal drama (nothing serious, just a result of many different personalities in a small space).
