I didn’t know adult life would be so lonely!
Like damn I just work, go to the gym and eat. My friends are far away and I barely meet new people. I used to be so excited for the weekends, now I don’t even care. I just can’t even picture a scenario where I’d find someone to date. 

I think I’m just kind of looking for some validation that I’m not the only one feeling this way. I’ve been using dating apps for the first time and it’s just depressing. Seeing all these people put on display and I’m one of them, seems so unnatural. I was swiping through people the other day and just felt bad.

I feel like I’m a pretty desirable person. I workout a ton, have my shit together and am comfortable talking to people. But I’m really struggling just finding people to meet! 

I went back to my college town recently and it reminded me how much has changed. Back there I hung out with a ton of people every day again and even got some numbers. But that fizzled out because I live so far away. 

It also makes me sad that there are literally 0 women I work with. Not even in the sense that I’d try to date a coworker. But I’m not even talking to women casually, like ever!

Sorry for the rant but it’s Friday night and I’m just sitting in my apartment alone wondering what I have to do to change this.

Edit: I thought I would share the pathetic reason that inspired me to post this.

Today when I was making dinner I found out I bought the wrong type of pasta. This kind said it has a serving of vegetables added to each cup of noodles. I was like oh shit that’s great. Then I broke down a bit because I have no one to share with this super stupid thing that happened to me. It was like that little spark of surprising happiness reminded me how alone I am right now. Holy shit what is up with that.
