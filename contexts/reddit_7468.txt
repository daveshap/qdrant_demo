Must have grad school supplies list?
I will shortly begin my MS in clinical psychology with a specialization in forensics in roughly a month. I’m completing this degree solely online. I will then go on to an in person PsyD program. 

This is my first time solely taking classes online. I have a laptop, Microsoft office, iPad, pens pencils, notebooks. The school “basics”. 

Is there anything that you’d recommend specifically for grad school?
