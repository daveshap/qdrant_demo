Is there a term for \"pretty much\" first person? Of course, novels in first person go like this:<blockquote>  \"Then I changed to my winged form. I hopped to the ledge. The kethel attacked me.</blockquote>The voice is literally that of the main character. As if he sat down and spoke his story to you from beginning to end.  I did this then that.Whereas third-person novels go like this:<blockquote>  \"Then Moon changed to his winged form. He hopped to the ledge. The kethel attacked him.</blockquote>The narrator is \"abstract\". It has no identity and is just \"the book\" telling you such happened and such happened.I was just reading the (outstanding!) novelist Martha Wells.Her Raksura novels are in third-person (so, in the usual way, written by an \"unknown, abstract\" narrator in the past tense),but,the action entirely follows the primary character. **So it's \"sort of\" first-person...So, indeed:you could \"convert\" every single sentence of the book to first person; literally every single sentence could be changed to \"I did blah...\" rather than \"Moon did blah...\".We hear (only) about Moon's actions and thoughts (just as in 1st person) and indeed we (only) \"go\" where Moon goes (just as in 1st person).I was wondering, is there actually a term for this?** Just to confuse matters, there are a few short passages in a later book in the series that arguably \"breaks away\" from the main character, but let's leave that out of the example.
