JAMES: Terrific.
CARMEN: But what we need is national coverage. It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
JAMES: I'll suggest it. Remember though, we're news, not features. It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police. Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
