Imposter Syndrome
Is anybody else accepted feeling guiltier than happy? I got into Penn yesterday and initially I was happy but the more I think about it, the more I don’t understand it. Looking at the stats and ECs of people rejected and deferred and they all just seem so much better than me. To all those extremely qualified people who didn’t get in, I’m sorry.
