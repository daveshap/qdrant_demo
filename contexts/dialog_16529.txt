CHARLOTTE: I don't want to go home.
BOB: I know. I don't either.
BOB: Lydia?
LYDIA: Hello, darling.
BOB: Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
LYDIA: Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
BOB: He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
LYDIA: That sounds great â€” can you hold on... What Zoe?
