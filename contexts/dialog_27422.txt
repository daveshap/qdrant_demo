POPESCU: Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
ANNA: Of course.
POPESCU: I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
MARTINS: Oh, you did.
POPESCU: Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
POPESCU: Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
ANNA: Thank you.
POPESCU: Keep the packet.
