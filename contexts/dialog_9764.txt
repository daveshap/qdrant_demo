LARRY: No problem, boss.
WALKER: Fletch.
FLETCH: Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
WALKER: No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
FLETCH: Uh, almost.
WALKER: 'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.

WALKER: Irwin...
FLETCH: Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
WALKER: Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
FLETCH: I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
WALKER: No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
FLETCH: I never read the paper.
WALKER: ...never reads the paper...
FLETCH: What's the spread on the game tonight?
WALKER: I don't know. Look!
FLETCH: Looks great.
