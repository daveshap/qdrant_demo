Is there a word that means unstoppably powerful, but also fast? I'm looking for a word that means something that is powerful, unstoppable, but also fast. \"Juggernaut\" covers the first part, but it implies enormous size and sluggish inertia. I feel like there's a word that fits the idea, but I can't come up with it.It's intended to be the name of vessel, so it doesn't have to be any particular part of speech.
