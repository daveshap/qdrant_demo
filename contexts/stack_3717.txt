Why do we care about Quasi-norm in Statistics and Machine Learning? I have understood that quasi-norm does not satisfy the inequality triangle.I also know that the norm is a function on vector space that assigns length or size to the vector.However, I do not exactly understand quasi-norm.I do not really understand why we want to study them within statistics and machine learning.I was wondering if anyone knew a nice intuitive motivation for the study of quasi-norm?Many thanks
