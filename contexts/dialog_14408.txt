JEZZIE: What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street. Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
JACOB: I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
JEZZIE: You look upset.
JACOB: I'm not upset.
JEZZIE: Jake, what is it?
JACOB: I'm tired.
JEZZIE: You look terrible. What happened? Jake ... is it the antidote?
JACOB: Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
JEZZIE: Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
JACOB: Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
JEZZIE: You can have anything you want.
JACOB: Then don't bug me.
JEZZIE: I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage. Where'd you go today?
JACOB: Mid-town mostly.
JEZZIE: Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
JACOB: I picked up my ticket. I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
JEZZIE: Oh? Where you going?
JACOB: West.
JEZZIE: Where's West? New Jersey?
JACOB: Don't be funny.
JEZZIE: I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
JACOB: Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
JEZZIE: Do what? I haven't done a thing.
JACOB: Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
