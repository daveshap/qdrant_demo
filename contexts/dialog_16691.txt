QUINCY: Alright. I heard you were in Spain.
MONICA: I was. I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
QUINCY: Just something I'm trying.
MONICA: No, it looks good. I mean, it's cool.
QUINCY: Thanks.
MONICA: Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
QUINCY: I'm alright. But you can sit.
MONICA: I'm fine. My dad said you tore your ACL.
QUINCY: Yup.
MONICA: What are the doctors saying?
QUINCY: A lot of things. All I know is I'll be back in six months.
MONICA: I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
QUINCY: Not for Quincy McCall.
MONICA: I forgot, Q-man.""
QUINCY: So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
MONICA: We won the championship.
QUINCY: Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
MONICA: Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
QUINCY: Funny. I never did.
MONICA: Kiss my ass.
QUINCY: Tried calling you a couple times.
MONICA: Oh yeah?
QUINCY: Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American. And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
MONICA: Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine. It was always messing up.
QUINCY: Figured it was something like that.
MONICA: Actually, I don't...
QUINCY: What do you mean?
MONICA: I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
QUINCY: A rest?
MONICA: Yeah. Basketball just, isn't fun anymore. You know?
QUINCY: No.
