WALLS: Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
FRANK: Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
WALLS: I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
FRANK: How's he doing?
WALLS: I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
FRANK: Does that hurt?
COATES: No!
