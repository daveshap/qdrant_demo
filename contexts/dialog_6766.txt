MARION: Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
JACK: Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
MARION: Take that back! Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
JACK: I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
MARION: Are you drunk?
JACK: Probably.
MARION: This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
JACK: Do you have to swear all the time?
MARION: Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
JACK: Marion, stop this.
MARION: What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
JACK: You're my conscience.
MARION: Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
MARION: What are you doing here? You know the rules.
JACK: What about a drink on the way home?
MARION: I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
JACK: I'm on at nine.
MARION: Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
