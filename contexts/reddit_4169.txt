Women who agree to a 2nd date but don't mean it.
In the past few years I've experienced the following with women between 35-41. I'm including ages because I think it's important to include. Here's what has happened about 3 times: Meet through Tinder/Bumble/Match for a drink. Spend anywhere from 3-5 hours talking, laughing, seemingly having a nice time. Walk the lady to her car and ask for a second date which she accepts with perceived enthusiasm, then I get ghosted. One never bothered to return texts, just disappeared. Another took a long time to respond and said she wasn't ready to date. My pictures are recent and I think I'm a reasonably charming, easy-to-talk-to guy. Here's my question: Are some women afraid to say no when the moment arises? I'm assuming that they may have no interest at all but are afraid to say it on the spot. I can understand this behavior from women in their 20s, but I figured by the time they reached their 40s they may be a little more honest and forthcoming. Is there a fear that a man might freak out if she says no? It's been very discouraging. I've been on dates that seem to go really well but end up in disappointment. This has not been very good for my ego. Thanks in advance for responses :)
