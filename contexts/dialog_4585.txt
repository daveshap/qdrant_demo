VIOLET: Why? Why would Johnnie do this?
CAESAR: Jesus Christ, Violet! Open your fucking eyes! Johnnie hates me like I hate him!
CAESAR: I hate that little fuck! I hate him! I hate him! I should've done him!
VIOLET: But you know he did it.
CAESAR: So what?! So fucking what? Use your head, Violet. The money is gone. Gino is coming here to get it. You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it! Is that what you think? I don't. You know what I think? I think I'm a dead man. I'm one in the brain. That's what I think!
VIOLET: Caesar, what are we going to do?
