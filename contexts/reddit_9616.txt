You are your best advocate! Good luck in the job search!
I have seen quite a few posts here and in some other SA forums that I belong to asking advice regarding the job search or negotiating job offers, etc.

My unsolicited advice for anyone looking or anyone in the SA field thinking about looking ... you are your own best advocate!

I think we do the field a disservice by acting like higher ed is so altruistic and a huge family that wants to help everyone out.  I have great relationships with some of my coworkers, but higher ed is a business just like anything else.  I’ve worked in the field long enough to see budget cuts, RIFs, reorgs, etc.  

Even with the most supportive supervisor, business decisions still get made, and you are the only person who is unequivocally your advocate!

So don’t be afraid to negotiate, ask for more, get clarity on your status of a candidate, etc.  (Of course, be professional and don’t burn bridges), but do not be afraid to advocate for yourself.  Good luck to all those still searching!  

(And I’ve worked in SA for a number of years, so always happy to provide advice via DM)
