We all know of “first date tips,” but what are your “first day of work tips”?
I’m sure we’ve all heard the common “tips” for first dates: don’t bring up your ex, don’t text, and avoid messy foods. 

**What are your tips for a first day (or week... or month) of work?**

Can I talk about my former employer during my first week? How do I remember names? Is it ok to eat lunch alone (by choice)? My workplace’s dress code is super lax... should I go fully business professional the first week?

Just wondering what your “tips & tricks” are when starting a new job!
