Clubs & Programming - purchases, contracts, etc
I work at a large urban college in a large city.

Genuinely curious about how your institutions handle spending money for goods/services. I've been at my place for about two years and I'm getting increasingly frustrated at the bureaucracy making it almost impossible to order anything for student clubs. This goes for simple things like food and party decorations, as well as signing major contracts.

How does your school handle these? Do you pay everything by PO? Do you have a departmental credit card that you/your clubs can use? Are you even allowed to do purchasing yourself, or does a separate office have to handle it? How long does this process usually take for you?

Thanks in advance, hivemind!
