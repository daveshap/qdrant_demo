TOM: When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
ANNIE: Well, that'll be a little complicated --
TOM: You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go -- -- if you'll help. You have a problem with that?
GRACE: Isn't it like, obvious?
TOM: Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
ANNIE: Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
TOM: Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
