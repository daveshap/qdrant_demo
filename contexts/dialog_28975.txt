SHORTIE: Are you screwy?
BRETT: I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
SHORTIE: You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
BRETT: Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
SHORTIE: You take some awful chances.
BRETT: Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
