Idiomatic expression meaning \"invented by someone and having caught on\" In Russian, we have an expression \u0441 \u043b\u0451\u0433\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0438 (\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e-\u0442\u043e), literally \"from the light hand (of smbd)\or, if I may, \"by the light touch (of smbd)\".It is used when someone coins a new word, or invents a new method of doing something, or comes up with a new idea etc., which catches on and people start using it.Is there a similar idiomatic expression in English?Some examples of what I'm looking for:<blockquote>    The idea of synthesis via manipulation of single atoms was expressed as early as 1959 by Richard Feynman, but it was not before 1974 that, [by the light touch of Norio Taniguchi], the word \"nano-technology\" appeared  [By the light touch of Sidney Brenner] the biologists got themselves a new test animal: the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
