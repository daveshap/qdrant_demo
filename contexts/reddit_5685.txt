Am I screwed if I've been unemployed for almost 6 months?
I graduated college in May, took a seasonal job for the summer, and then had a couple of medical issues to address that took a few months. Looking for a job now, but I've been out of the workforce for almost 6 months now. I've heard that being unemployed for 6 or more months is a big turn off for employers and makes it harder to find a job - is that true for someone who is a college grad but hasn't had a full-time job before?
