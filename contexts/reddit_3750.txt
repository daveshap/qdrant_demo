Modern Dating is a Really Shitty Game
A game where everyone is highly disposable despite each player having non disposable feelings. A game where selfishness and lies are rewarded with convenience and bliss. A game where stronger players and even spectators can prey on weaker players because everyone is highly disposable and nobody really cares about your feelings unless you're helping them win.

It may not seem like such a big deal if you're the type of person who constantly has new options to milk and attempt to win with, but it's actually really rough for those of us who have to wait months between decent chances of getting anywhere near a win. It's especially rough when one of these chances just turns out to be someone wasting our time or simply using us for whatever secondary objective they're really after.

What's sad is that if we could all grow a spine, communicate with one another like grown, responsible adults, and treat each other's feelings like we'd like our own to be treated this game wouldn't be so nasty and difficult.

But oh well. All a boy can do is try his best and set the example for what he'd like to see in the world.
