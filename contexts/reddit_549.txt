Weight loss/gain help
I'm 17 years old and I have noticed I've lost a lot of weight since I was maybe around 16. My arms are so skinny and I am around my neck, collar bones, Back and hips.
I don't have a problem with eating food. I eat loads of it. But sinces 16 I've been losing it very fast rather than putting any weight on. 
If I do manage to put any weight on its only on my stomach which annoys me alot.

Has anyone experienced this problem? Should I see a doctor? Both of my parents are getting worried about me.
