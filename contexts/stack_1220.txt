SQL Server - register Service Principle Name without service restart? I have a live SQL Server 2012 environment that had no SPN registered - this has previously not been an issue as Kerberos authentication wasn't required.  But now it is required.I have configured everything correctly, but after these changes I want to ensure that SQL Server can register the SPN's successfully- preferably without a service restart as this is a live environment.Is there a way of doing this?P.S. I know I can register the SPN's manually, but I want to make certain that they can be registered automatically.
