ALFRED: Welcome to Rome, sir.

DARWIN: For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide! Alfred, hold my calls. So, Hawk! The Hawkster! What do you think of the vehicle?
HAWK: You could host American Bandstand in here. Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
DARWIN: Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
