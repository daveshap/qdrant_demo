ANNIE: Sing it to me, Frankie!
ROBERT: How's my pregnant chick!
ANNIE: You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
ROBERT: I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
ANNIE: Aw... that's so sweet.
ROBERT: I love you.
ANNIE: Do you? Do you really?
