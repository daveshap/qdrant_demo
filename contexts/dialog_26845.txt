ROVERINI: Dickie Greenleaf?
RIPLEY: Yes?
ROVERINI: Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?
ROVERINI: It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
RIPLEY: I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
ROVERINI: So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
RIPLEY: I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
ROVERINI: Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
RIPLEY: Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
ROVERINI: So, the Doctor, he has to make the -- -- come se dice?
RIPLEY: Postmortem?
ROVERINI: Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
RIPLEY: Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
ROVERINI: No.
MARGE: Did he kill Freddie?
RIPLEY: Marge, when did you get here?
MARGE: Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
RIPLEY: I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
MARGE: I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you. What happened to your face?
RIPLEY: Dickie did it.
MARGE: Dickie?
RIPLEY: My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me. Are you getting on?
MARGE: What?
RIPLEY: Get on. I'll take you to him.
MARGE: Where does Dickie live?
RIPLEY: We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
MARGE: Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
RIPLEY: No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie. Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
RIPLEY: Can we go up? Do you mind?
ROVERINI: Of course. What happened to your face?
RIPLEY: My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers.
RIPLEY: The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
ROVERINI: Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
RIPLEY: I really don't want to see anybody.
ROVERINI: Even your fiancée...?
RIPLEY: Even her.
ROVERINI: What about Thomas Ripley?
RIPLEY: What about Ripley?
