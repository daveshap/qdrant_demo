where to update Java JDK? (not how to install) All the questions on here I've found are how to install JDK. I have JDK already, but Android Studio says it's outdated. I'm asking where I can update JDK.\"which java\" in terminal gives /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/bin/java, but installing the tar file there does not update the JDK. Neither does installing in /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle.Thanks.
