ED: Bela. I just wanna thank you again for last night.
BELA: That's fine, Eddie. All in the line of duty.
ED: No. Seriously. I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me. A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
BELA: Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
ED: I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
BELA: Eddie, this is quite a scene.
ED: I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
