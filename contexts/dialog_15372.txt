CALLER: Hello, Peter.
PETER: Just a second. Hello?
CALLER: Very amateurish, Peter. I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic. I'm not an idiot! Don't treat me as one! I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you! Are you ready to play?
PETER: Yes. Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
CALLER: To get your attention.
PETER: Did you know her?
CALLER: No, only the path she chose to travel.
PETER: And -- what path is that?
CALLER: We all have paths to follow. You hope yours will lead you to me.
PETER: Why did you write remember on the wall?
CALLER: That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself. Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
PETER: Why not?
CALLER: You don't want to think and that's why I'll win! I'm already two points ahead.
PETER: What?
CALLER: I did another one last night. You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
PETER: Where is she?
CALLER: You'll find her.
PETER: If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
