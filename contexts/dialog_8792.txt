ARTHUR: Thanks to God, you are alive.
LANCELOT: I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
ARTHUR: You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
LANCELOT: Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
ARTHUR: But your life and lands are far from here.
LANCELOT: I gave up my castles and my lands!
LANCELOT: My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
ARTHUR: And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
