MARGO: Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
PLAGUE: Once again, don't call me Eugene. A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
MARGO: Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
PLAGUE: Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love, sex, secret and... ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
PLAGUE: A hacker planted the virus.
MARGO: Virus?
PLAGUE: Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
MARGO: Excuse me?
PLAGUE: The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
MARGO: What, it left a note?
