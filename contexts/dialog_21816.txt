BUDDY: Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
ROSE: No. No, I'm all right. Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell! I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
ROSE: Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
BUDDY: Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
ROSE: I sure hope you don't. I gotta get outta here, good night.
BUDDY: Good night, Rose.
DADDY: Rose, what are you doing up?
ROSE: Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
DADDY: Is anything wrong?
ROSE: No, sir.
DADDY: Well, good night.
