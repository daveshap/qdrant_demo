ETIENNE: One kilometer
FRANCOISE: Two.
ETIENNE: Richard?
RICHARD: I don't know - I'm American.
ETIENNE: So?
RICHARD: We think in miles, not kilometers.
ETIENNE: So how many miles do you think it is?
RICHARD: I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
FRANCOISE: Too far?
RICHARD: If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we donâ€™t try then we'll never know.
