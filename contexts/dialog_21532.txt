BIALYSTOCK: We swear it!
LIEBKIND: Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
BIALYSTOCK: Yes. We would!
LIEBKIND: Good. I will make the preparations.
BLOOM: Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath. I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
BIALYSTOCK: Shut up, you idiot. He's a harmless nut. Play along with him. It's almost in the bag.
