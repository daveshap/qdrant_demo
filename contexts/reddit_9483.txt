Worth the phone call!
My husband had some changes in 2020 to his medical coverage. We got hit hard in January and had to take a loan to pay for his special insulin. We changed it with the help of a social worker who busted her butt for us and found a way to get relief from the cost going forward. No medicine should be over 8.50 for a year!  When I got the letter, I looked and it was backdated to January. When I called the pharmacy to ask if there was any way we could recover what I had to pay and they were able to help us rebill his medicines. We are getting back over 400.00 from the pharmacy!!! We can pay back the loan and it only took a wonderful person who researched for me! Read the fine print. It can make a major difference.

Edit for clarification: Thank you all for your responses. This plan called "extra help" is for people on medicare insurance with astonomical costs even with insurance coverage. It will help pay all but 8.50 per month per medicine. His monthly out of pocket cost without any isurance for just one medicine (a special insulin) is 2700.00 called u500 made by one company who offers awesome payment plans for commercial insurance, under insured, and for children. The 400.00 we saved was for his medicare part d insurance annual deductible. Stay awesome reddit. Thanks for reading!
