HAWK: Dude, this is all I got.
SCALPER: Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
HAWK: Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
SCALPER: The easy way.
SCALPER: You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
HAWK: I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
SCALPER: Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.
HAWK: Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
SCALPER: Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
HAWK: Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
SCALPER: Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
