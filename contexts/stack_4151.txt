Transit Visa required through PEK (Beijing International Airport) for a passport holder of Kyrgyzstan? I am really confused and looked at various websites, but do NOT have enough information about passport holders of Kyrgyzstan needing a transit visa if going through the PEK Aiport in Beijing. Do Kyrgyz passport holders need a transit visa if going through the PEK airport to get to Macau?The flight are as follows:Bishkek > Kazakhstan > Beijing > Macau (Destination)
