ANNIE: I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
PAUL: I don't know.
ANNIE: Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril. How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
PAUL: Great.
ANNIE: See, isn't this nice?
PAUL: Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
ANNIE: And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
PAUL: If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
ANNIE: Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
PAUL: Set what up?
ANNIE: That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
PAUL: Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
ANNIE: Oh, but Paul! I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at-- --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
PAUL: Misery's Return?
ANNIE: I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
ANNIE: Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it. Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
PAUL: You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
ANNIE: I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
PAUL: You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
