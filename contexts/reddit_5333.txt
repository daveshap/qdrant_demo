How to avoid the temptation to be lazy/procrastinate at work when not busy?
My work tends to alternate between extremely busy periods and down times. The thing is, during down times I've noticed that I tend to slow down and waste time by drawing out tasks that I normally do a lot faster during busy periods.

Although there's nothing urgent for me to do during down times, there are things like additional training/readings to do to advance my career, but I can't do them if I don't make time for them. I'm just wondering if anyone here is guilty of doing the same thing, and if anyone has any tips on how to stop this. Thanks.
