Travelling to Lisbon from India I am planning to travel to Lisbon on 23/September and return to India on 6/October.I am planning to travel to Paris/Madrid and then take a train from there.Can some one tell me how much time does it take to reach Lisbon from Paris/Madrid and what is the frequency of trains. Do I need transit visa for that?
