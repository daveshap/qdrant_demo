How to handle being on-call overnight for new job?
Have a job where I am required to be on-call overnight for 4 days a week, every 2-3 weeks. I would be responding to nuisance complaints that may originate from a construction site that my company operates, and attempting to determine if indeed our site is responsible. Keep in mind that these overnight duties are in addition to my generally office-based 9-5 job duties.

I have anxiety issues, and I can see myself lying awake at night for hours, waiting for the call to come. Then when it does, I'll be tired and miserable and not do a good job. Not to mention that driving alone while tired to a site in the middle of nowhere at 1am could definitely be a safety hazard.

The anxiety and anticipation is really eating at me, but I feel I have no choice but to do this as I really need this job. I'm afraid that if I ask to taken off the on-call schedule, I could get let go and replaced by someone better able to handle this part of the job. Not to mention I'd feel terrible to put this extra burden on my coworkers who rotate these duties with me.
