JEFFERSON: I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.

JEFFERSON: Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
SPIELER: Yes, *sir*. Let's *go* Henry.
