MILLS: Oh, you want to stay now?
SOMERSET: One of two things will happen. We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
MILLS: You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
SOMERSET: I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days. You'd be doing me the favor.
MILLS: You knew I'd say yes.
SOMERSET: No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
SOMERSET: As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
MILLS: Big surprise.
