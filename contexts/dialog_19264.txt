DIXIE: I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
CASE: I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
DIXIE: Who got you into this?
CASE: A guy who calls himself Armitage.
DIXIE: Never heard of him.
CASE: Nobody has.
CASE: I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
DIXIE: No problem, amigo.
CASE: What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
DIXIE: Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass. Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
CASE: What?
DIXIE: When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
