Moving States?
I've already finished my undergraduate degree and have started looking at different masters programs and one piece of advise that I was given from a couple of mentors working in SA is to consider going out of state for my masters. I'm currently in California and both of them, California Alumni, said that their experience out of state, in Vermont and DC, added a completely different perspective from the university systems that they were used to. I was wondering if anyone else has had the same experience or has additional insights on pursuing a program in a state that isn't where they got their undergrad.
