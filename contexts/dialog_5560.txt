DIL: My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
FERGUS: Shut up.
DIL: Made me feel all funny inside.
FERGUS: I said stop it.
DIL: Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
FERGUS: You think that's wise?
DIL: Nothing's wise.
FERGUS: I didn't mean to hit you.
DIL: I know that.
FERGUS: Kind of liked you as a girl.
DIL: That's a start.
FERGUS: So I'm sorry.
DIL: Make it up to me, then.
FERGUS: How?
DIL: Ask to meet me again.
FERGUS: Will you meet me again?
DIL: When?
FERGUS: Whenever. Tonight.
FERGUS: Do they know?
DIL: Know what, honey?
FERGUS: Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
DIL: Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
FERGUS: Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
DIL: Details, baby, details.
FERGUS: So they do know.
DIL: All right, they do.
FERGUS: Don't.
DIL: Sorry.
FERGUS: I should have known, shouldn't I?
DIL: Probably.
FERGUS: Kind of wish I didn't.
DIL: You can always pretend.
FERGUS: That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
DIL: Absolutely.
FERGUS: Won't be quite the same though, will it?
DIL: Are you pretending yet?
FERGUS: I'm working on it.
FERGUS: There's Dave. He knew too.
DIL: Stop it, Jimmy.
FERGUS: Am I becoming repetitious?
DIL: A little.
FERGUS: Sorry.
FERGUS: Don't ask me in.
DIL: Please, Jimmy.
FERGUS: No. Can't pretend that much.
DIL: I miss you, Jimmy.
FERGUS: Should have stayed a girl.
DIL: Don't be cruel.
FERGUS: Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
DIL: Only if you kiss me.
FERGUS: Happy now?
DIL: Delirious.
