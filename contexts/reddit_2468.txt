Since covid and working-from-home happened, I've been so bored at my job that it's unbearable. How do I get myself to chill out and just do my job?
My job was never very interesting to begin with, doing data analytics work for a payroll/insurance company. However, since I've been working from home I've had absolutely no motivation to complete even the core basics of my job. There are no longer projects coming in to keep my interest, and it's all back to data entry again. I know it's bad to let my mind wander and do other things during my work time, but I just can't convince myself that it's worth it anymore. Hell, I've even been putting my data analyst skills to work by collecting measurements of my houseplants and compiling and graphing the data from them, but I just keep avoiding doing my actual job. I really gotta stop and calm myself down, especially since finding a more interesting job will be impossible with the covid recession and businesses are not hiring.
