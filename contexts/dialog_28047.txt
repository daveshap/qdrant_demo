LUCY: I can't sleep with the closet door open, either. Not even a crack. Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared. I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
GRANDPA: Closet monster!?
LUCY: Dad! Don't sneak up on people like that!
GRANDPA: It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
