I’m not even going to bother using a throwaway
Try as I may, every evening ends the same. I can drink 8 gallons of water, ace a job interview, run a marathon, and by the time I lay in bed and stare at the ceiling the same thoughts race through my mind. “I don’t want to be alive.”

I love that communities like this exist. But, at the end of the day, a suicide hotline or a stranger on the internet telling me “it’ll be okay, buddy” doesn’t fix the fundamental problematic default setting of my brain.

Chronic depression is hell, plain and simple. It’s a constant uphill battle. And lately I feel like Sisyphus, no matter how hard I push my disease up a hill, it’s going to come tumbling back down to crush me under its weight eventually.

I’m so tired of pushing stones up hills. I’m so, unbelievably, fucking tired.
