JERRY: No --- how does it go?
BIENSTOCK: Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk. They went to a conservatory.
JERRY: How about that talent? This is like falling into a tub of butter.
JOE: Watch it, Daphne!
JERRY: When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
JOE: Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
JOE: Not there - that's the emergency brake.
JERRY: Now you've done it!
JOE: Done what?
JERRY: Tore off one of my chests.
JOE: You'd better go fix it.
JERRY: You better come help me.
JOE: This way, Daphne.
JERRY: Now you tore the other one.
SUGAR: OH!
JERRY: Terribly sorry.
SUGAR: That's all right. I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
JOE: Tell what?
SUGAR: If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band. You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
JERRY: That's us. I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
SUGAR: I'm Sugar Cane.
JOE: I changed it. It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
JERRY: Polish?
SUGAR: Yes. I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
JOE: Where did he conduct?
SUGAR: On the Baltimore and Ohio.
JOE: Oh.
SUGAR: I play the ukulele. And I sing too.
JERRY: She sings, too.
SUGAR: I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either. I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
JOE: Running away? From what?
SUGAR: Don't get me started on that. Want a drink? It's bourbon.
JERRY: We'll take a rain check.
SUGAR: I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to. Especially when I'm blue.
JOE: We understand.
SUGAR: All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught. That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
SUGAR: Are my seams straight?
JERRY: I'll say.
SUGAR: See you around, girls.
JERRY: Bye, Sugar. We been playing with the wrong bands.
JOE: Down, Daphne!
JERRY: How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
JOE: Forget it. One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
JERRY: Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
JOE: Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
JERRY: You tore it again!
SUE: Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
JOE: No - funerals.
SUE: Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
