CONNOR: Donna's gonna be angry about her cat.
ROCCO: Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her. But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
CONNOR: You sound real remorseful.
ROCCO: She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
CONNOR: Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
ROCCO: What?
CONNOR: Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
ROCCO: What are you saying?
CONNOR: Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
ROCCO: You think they sold me out? No way.
CONNOR: He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
ROCCO: No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
CONNOR: He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
ROCCO: No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
CONNOR: Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
ROCCO: No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
MURPHY: Where are you goin'? Did you tell him?
CONNOR: Yes.
MURPHY: Then what the fuck?
ROCCO: Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
MURPHY: Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
ROCCO: Fuck you!
MURPHY: Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
ROCCO: Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh? Fuck you!
