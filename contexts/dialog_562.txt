POP: What was that? You got something to say, say it! Say it!
WADE: Nothing.
POP: You no-good pup!
WADE: It don't look right.
NICK: What?
WADE: The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
NICK: Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
WADE: I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
NICK: This town sucks.
WADE: Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with Home Made Cooking"
