MASON: Listen, Arlo...
MASON: ...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
MASON: ...shit.
ARLO: To tell you the truth, you didn't.
ARLO: Not completely, anyway.
ARLO: I mean, if that gun was...
ARLO: ...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
ARLO: ...-er. It was your friend...
ARLO: ...Long. Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis...
ARLO: ...shit.
MASON: Well, all the same. If we get to Missoula, help me find a car. I'd appreciate it. Then...you can...
MASON: ...split.
ARLO: Split? I wouldn't get ten...
ARLO: ...miles.
MASON: 
ARLO: Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
