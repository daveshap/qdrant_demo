DREIBERG: No wonder Adrian's rich. You use that stuff?
LAURIE: Sure. It works. I mean, look at this face, Daniel. I'm thirty-eight years old!
DREIBERG: I don't mind getting older. I'm obsolete anyway. Why try to hide it?
LAURIE: I like the way you look. It's strange with Jon. He doesn't age. His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
DREIBERG: Old?
LAURIE: Not at all. You look very -- dashing. Here, you pick one.
DREIBERG: . . . What?
LAURIE: Pick a record. I feel like dancing.
