Which is the better option for my dependents, L2 or B2 visa? I currently have a B2 visa. I intend to bring my wife and son for visit to the US for travel and pleasure with me, and so I would like them to apply for their own B2 visa. My current company intends to apply for an L1B visa for me, for an upcoming work assignment. Which is the better option for my dependents? Option 1) Apply for a B2 visa? or Option 2) Apply for an L2 (I believe that is the dependent visa for L1B holders) once I get the L1B visa? The intention is also to be able to travel in the future for pleasure and visit.
