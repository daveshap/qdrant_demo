Do you ever just feel lonely
Lonely to the point you feel like you have no one or no one can truly understand your pain or you. Yeah I understand everybody has pain. But do you ever feel soo lost in yourself you don't even know who you are anymore. So dayum lost even the person who you thought you could trust the most would never betray you and hurt you that way. I don't know what life is for me anymore. I feel so lost in who I am. I just wanna sleep forever
