I deleted a post because I got anxiety when nobody responded to it...
I’m gonna keep this short because I don’t want to spend a long time writing another post that nobody will interact with. Basically I wrote a post for a productivity subreddit explaining how I’ve been extremely unproductive over the last year and a half, only doing something productive for less than 3 hours out of any given day. I waited for over an hour for someone to offer solutions or to relate, but nobody commented and I didn’t even get so much as an upvote. I started to feel really stupid for posting it at all and I couldn’t stop thinking about how everyone who saw it probably thought I’m extremely lazy and have strange priorities and goals for my future. I probably could’ve left it up throughout the night and I’m sure someone would’ve eventually responded, but I was starting to feel anxious about what people must think of me. Does anyone else feel this way when their post is ignored? 

EDIT: Since this post has gotten a bit of attention, can anyone help with the issue I talked about in my deleted post that was ignored? So like...what helps you be productive in life? Should I get a job (even though the thought of it gives me anxiety)? How do you stick to deadlines you set for yourself? I’m having trouble living a fulfilling life at the moment.
