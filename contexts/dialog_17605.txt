ROPER: You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
MCCALL: I don't gamble.
MCCALL: Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
ROPER: You living together?
MCCALL: She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
ROPER: Explain how that works.
MCCALL: She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
ROPER: She grow up in Livingtston, too?
MCCALL: No, no, no... She's from Hoboken.
ROPER: Oh, city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?"
MCCALL: We see each other every couple of months.
ROPER: Every couple of months, huh?
ROPER: That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
MCCALL: Do you really?
ROPER: No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
MCCALL: Thanks for clearing that up. I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
ROPER: Where did you hear that?
MCCALL: Around. Barnett's tough competition.
ROPER: Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
ROPER: Lesson two, Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage."
MCCALL: I think I can handle that one.
ROPER: Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
