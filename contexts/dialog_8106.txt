JACK: You lost me, Sid. Who?
HUDGEONS: Contract players at Metro. You pinch 'em. I do you up feature in the next issue. Plus the usual fifty cash. Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
JACK: I need an extra fifty. Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
HUDGEONS: Jack! It's Christmas!
JACK: No. It's felony possession of marijuana.
HUDGEONS: They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
JACK: Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
HUDGEONS: I like it! I like it!
