DR. BEASLEY: Beasley.
JACK: Baker.
DR. BEASLEY: What's our friend's problem?
JACK: Teeth.
DR. BEASLEY: What's wrong with them?
JACK: They're falling out.
DR. BEASLEY: Uh-oh. That's not good. Let's get him up here.
DR. BEASLEY: They gotta go.
JACK: How many?
DR. BEASLEY: Five's my guess. Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there. Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
JACK: Isn't there something you can give him? A pill or something?
DR. BEASLEY: Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
JACK: How will he eat?
DR. BEASLEY: Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes. Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
JACK: No bones?
DR. BEASLEY: No bones.
JACK: What do you do to him?
DR. BEASLEY: Don't worry, Mr. Baker. We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
JACK: I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
DR. BEASLEY: The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
