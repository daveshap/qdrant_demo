BRANDON: You forgetting the gag line, Killaine. The police don't take anything for granted.
KILLAINE: I'm afraid they do. Far too often. So long.
BRANDON: Wait a minute. I'll go with you.
KILLAINE: You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
BRANDON: Now and then. Mostly just for the fun of it.
KILLAINE: I tried it once. I lost my shirt.
BRANDON: I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
KILLAINE: Where did it all come from? Or is that a permissible question?
BRANDON: I had a father who knew how to steal.
KILLAINE: What?
BRANDON: You asked me where it all came from.
KILLAINE: Oh. That was just one of those idle questions. One doesn't expect an answer.
