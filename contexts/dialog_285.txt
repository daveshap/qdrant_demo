CATES: Tell me something. Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
HAMMOND: Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
CATES: I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
HAMMOND: You sure that's the reason?
CATES: Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
HAMMOND: Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
CATES: Yeah. Guess not.
