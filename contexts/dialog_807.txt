ROBY: Yeah, okay.
STANDARD: Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
MELKONIS: Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
ROBY: Close...
BROUSSARD: Close enough to walk to!
STANDARD: Martin, would you run me an atmospheric?
ROBY: 10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
STANDARD: Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
ROBY: Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
STANDARD: Good! Moisture content?
ROBY: Zero. Dry as a bone.
STANDARD: Any microorganisms?
ROBY: Not a one. It's dead.
STANDARD: Anything else?
ROBY: Yeah, rock particles. Dust.
STANDARD: Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
