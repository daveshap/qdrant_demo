Share books and bookmarks between all devices I have lots of books bought or downloaded not from Apple's store.I would like to simply put a book on my mac, then see it on my iPhone and iPad.I also like to read it on my iPad, set a bookmark, and keep reading from same page on my iPhone.Why Apple makes it so hard to work natively with MY books ? Its my device, so why is it matter how did I get my book ?Thanks.
