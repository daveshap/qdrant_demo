I'm a bit insecure about my body, and that makes me sad when I think too much about it.
Specifically my arms. They're not thin noodly arms for my age, it's just that all my life the top part of my arms' been covered in weird red freckle-like bumps, they look like angry rashes or something (but doesn't look as unhealthy). Kinda noticed it again when a girl I liked sat next to me and both out arms kinda brushed against each other for the duration of the ride. I'm not sure if the contact made her feel uncomfortable or what.   


Makes me a bit insecure wearing a t-shirt now, because I usually wear a shirt to work and that covers up the bumps.
