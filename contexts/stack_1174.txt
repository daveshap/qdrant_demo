Saving all sql server transactions to txt for a transactional replication to another database I have sql server 2014 running my main database at location A. I want to know if it would be possible to export all insert,update and delete queries to txt files for me to then run on a off site database ? I need to set up something like sql servers transactional replication but with the queries being sent to txt files. Is it possible for sql 2014 to log and export queries to txt files ? is there any softwares i could use ? Due to cost reasons setting up a vpn to the offsite database for transactional replication is unfeasable.
