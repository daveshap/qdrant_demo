Vehicle Diagnostics using BLE? I have a requirement where the diagnostics of a vehicle has to be carried out using BLE. The number of read/write parameters would be over 300.I had worked on BLE devices in a wearable application where the attributes were around 12-15 (using GATT).Is BLE the right choice for over 300 parameters in different profiles?What kind of BLE profile and UUID type can be used for this?
