Does anyone else unconsciously sigh constantly to calm themselves down and accidentally worry people/piss them off
I live around Koreans who think sighing is rude, and other people have mentioned that I sigh a lot especially when I am stressed, but it doesn't mean I am upset necessarily or displeased with the person I am with, I just do that to help myself think more clearly and get rid of the anxious feeling/dread in my chest and stomach. It usually works for a bit and then I have to do it again a few minutes later. I was not conscious that I did this until I moved to Korea and got scolded for doing this. Not doing it is almost unbearable physiologically though - I feel like I have to do it to release the sensation in my chest and stomach. Am I the only one?
