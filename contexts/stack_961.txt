Terminal and Nautilus stopped working after a crash Something went terribly wrong and, after a C++ program I was working on crashed, my terminal and nautilus (files) stopped working.I managed to install Terminator (another shell emulator), here is what I am getting when trying to start Terminal from Terminator:<blockquote>  (gnome-shell:779): Clutter-CRITICAL **: 01:49:35.532: Unable to  initialize Clutter: Unable to initialize the Clutter backend: no  available drivers found. (gnome-shell:779): mutter-WARNING **:  01:49:35.532: Unable to initialize Clutter.</blockquote>Here is what I get when launching Nautilus (btw somehow I can launch it from Terminator but not by clicking the icon)<blockquote>  ** (nautilus:445): WARNING **: 01:48:33.021: AT-SPI: Could not obtain desktop path or name  ** (nautilus:445): WARNING **: 01:48:33.026: AT-SPI: Could not obtain desktop path or name  ** (nautilus:445): WARNING **: 01:48:33.031: AT-SPI: Could not obtain desktop path or name    ..... another 10-15 repetitions of that error ....    ** (nautilus:445): WARNING **: 01:48:33.509: AT-SPI: Could not obtain desktop path or name  ** (nautilus:445): WARNING **: 01:48:33.509: AT-SPI: Could not obtain desktop path or name</blockquote>Any pointers on how I can get things back to normal?EDIT: It does persist after reboot.
