Off topic, but does anyone have any cool interior decorating resources for an apartment
Hey all! I'm moving to a new and unfurnished 1-bedroom apartment at the end of next month and am looking for some inspiration, resources, or ideas for really making this place my own. For some context, I currently live in on-campus furnished housing so I'm pretty much starting from scratch, which is stressful, but really exciting because I can actually make this *my* apartment. 

I have a bed, mattress, nightstand, dresser and TV stand on lock but am looking for an affordable couch and dining set that fit with my aesthetic is sort of boho meets minimalist meets masculine. Sort of an urban-outfitters approach, and I really like the look of natural wood and metal. That said, I'm having trouble finding some inspiration. 

What does your apartment look like? What are your must know hacks for really making a place yours? Do you have any advice for me? What are the little pieces and things you think I might forget? Really looking forward to hearing your responses!
