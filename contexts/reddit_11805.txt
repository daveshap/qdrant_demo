Anxiety about the general passage of time. [PM me!]
I've been becoming more aware of time passing. I think about my father getting older, and the idea if eventually losing him is overwhelming.  the concept of time running out is always on my mind. I suppose a fear of death is part of it, but it's more an anxiety of not having spent my time correctly. Not accomplishing enough, not having learned enough or done something worth while enough when the sand runs out.  I guess most people just ignore these types of thoughts and try not to focus on them, but I feel like it's something I should overcome instead of bury. I really just don't know what to do with those basic truths about life. I'd be grateful for any advice on how to approach those concepts. Thank you.
