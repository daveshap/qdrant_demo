Red Flags to Look Out for in Online Dating
I (25M) am by no means an expert in online dating but here are some of the red flags I have found that can help you screen out people:

1. If you are the one asking all of the questions and they NEVER ask anything about yourself. I have found that these individuals don't want to get to know you by text and don't turn out to be much better in person either.
2. Take really close note of their pics. Ex: I am not a huge drinker and therefore if a woman has three pics of herself out with friends at a party this is a clear sign we probably won't work out.
3. If someone's opener is anything in the "hey", "sup", "hi" ballpark then they are probably not going to be a great conversationalist. I have maybe found one woman who bucks this trend but for the most part this will hold true. 
4. If they are flaky over a chat they are likely to be flaky in real life as well.
5. People who tell you more in their profile tend to be the ones who care more. This may seem obvious, but many people still try to pursue that cutie who has nothing other than his or her name on their profile. I have found that people who want you to know them better will give you more info off the bat

I hope some of this was helpful and please feel free to disagree with me.
