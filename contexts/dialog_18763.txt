ZACH: Good morning.
SAUNDRA: Good morning.
ZACH: Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
SAUNDRA: Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
ZACH: I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
SAUNDRA: Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
ZACH: Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ? I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
