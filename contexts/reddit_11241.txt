I haven’t been feeling myself at all lately
Ever since this pandemic started I haven’t been feeling the same, I feel like I lost all my wits and my creativity. I don’t feel like the funny guy anymore, I feel so dry sometimes when I talk to people I used to always enjoy talking to. I’ve been depressed and having anxiety for most of the quarantine. I haven’t really been doing the things I loved most and watching the shows and funny youtubers I’d always binge watch. 

I feel really insecure cause I feel like I have nothing to bring to the table when I’m with my FaceTime group I always end up staying quiet sometimes. Whenever I try to be funny now it just sounds stupid, I’m not sure where to go from this point and how to solve this exactly. I can’t really think straight, I wanna be myself again.
