People always tell you to get therapy or to get help.
Yeah like I just walk up to the hospital and say "one therapy please" I don't know anything about this shit. Where do I go? What do I ask for? Do I have to pay for it? I can barely afford food. How the actual f am I supposed to just go get help? This wasnt taught in school people. I dont know what to look for. And god knows that Google cant answer anything more specific than what day of the week is it. It's hard if you're the type who is easily overwhelmed you know? My brain gets fried every time I think about it.

Edit: Thanks for all the support guys. There's a lot of stuff out there I didnt even know existed. I really appreciate your help.
