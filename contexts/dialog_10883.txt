DANA: Oh, sure. I'm getting used to this.
LOUIS: I'm innocent! Honest, Dana. I never touched you. Not that I remember anyway.
DANA: All right, what happened to me?
VENKMAN: Nothing! We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
DANA: Really! Is it gone?
VENKMAN: Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions. This one took some work.
DANA: Thank you. Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
VENKMAN: This is going to cost you, you know. Our fees are ridiculously high.
DANA: Talk to my accountant.
