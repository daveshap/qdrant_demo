REESE: What about it?
SARAH: Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
REESE: Molecular-memory.
SARAH: Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government. Right?
REESE: That's the way it was told to me.
SARAH: Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard. Eighty-six it. We'll blow up the place...burn it down. Something.
REESE: Tactically dangerous. We lay low.
SARAH: Reese. Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again. We have to so it ourselves.
REESE: That's not my mission.
SARAH: Listen. Understand. I'm not a military objective, Reese. I'm a person... You don't own me.
REESE: Let's go. Time to move out.
SARAH: Fuck you! Let go of me!
