LEO: You smell gas?
SUPER: Don't smell nothin'. He must not be dead in here.
LEO: Jesus.
SUPER: Hey, it's the best way to tell.
SUPER: You think he's drunk somewhere?
LEO: Wouldn't blame him if he was.
SUPER: Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency. He lose his job or somethin'?
LEO: What's his rent?
SUPER: Thirty a month.
LEO: Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place. Now, I need a moment alone.
SUPER: Huh?
LEO: Take a hike. Am-scray.
SUPER: Huh? Oh, sure. Just pull the door shut when you leave.
