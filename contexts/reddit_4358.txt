Please tell me there's more to life than relationships
I don't think I'll ever have relationships, friends or a girlfriend.  I'm a piece of shit holding on to a lot of guilt and shame for things I've done.  I don't think I can be around people for long knowing they would not understand or accept me.  There has to be something in life I can get lost in that's relatively healthy.  Healthier than slowly killing myself.
