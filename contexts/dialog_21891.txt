LISA: It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
JEFF: He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
JEFF: That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
LISA: What about it?
JEFF: He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
LISA: Someone not his wife?
JEFF: I never saw him ask her for advise before. But she volunteered plenty.
LISA: I wonder where he's going now?
JEFF: I don't know.
LISA: Suppose he doesn't come back again?
JEFF: He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
LISA: Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
JEFF: Not yet!
