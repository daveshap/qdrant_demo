ETHAN: We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
CLAYTON: How many, would you say?
ETHAN: Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
MARTIN: Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
ETHAN: It's what I'm countin' on.
MARTIN: I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
ETHAN: Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
MARTIN: She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
CLAYTON: Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
ETHAN: There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance? Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
MARTIN: I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
ETHAN: You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
ETHAN: I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
CLAYTON: Now mount up, son...
