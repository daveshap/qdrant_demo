How is Clinton/DNC's funding of the Trump Dossier different than typical opposition research?
It's being reported that the "Trump Dossier" that hit back in January [was funded in part by Clinton's campaign and the DNC](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/25/the-clinton-camp-and-the-dnc-helped-pay-for-that-trump-russia-dossier-heres-what-it-means/?utm_term=.f34f8e4d9c84). 

[My impression that opposition research is commonplace these days](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-do-politicians-gather-opposition-research-on-other-candidates/) â€” how is the Trump dossier different?
