what is my dream job?
 I had a dream in which I was working in a building with many floors in a city centre somewhere. we were not allowed to leave until our contracts were terminated/completed.

There were many floors and some were just for buffet foods, and some were for gyms, swimming pools and so on. Everything was completely free and we were paid ontop of that but we couldn't technically use the money as we were not allowed to leave. we had our own simple rooms with lockers and lockable doors. what is this dream job of mine?
