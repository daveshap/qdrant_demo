Loudness of air movement Is the soundpressure, which is created by air movement, the same as if it is created by sounds? If you use a microphone with a pop filter and without a pop filter and you blow into it, than there is a huge difference in soundpressure, but is this really soundpressure like from a noise?For example:Noise is a longitudinal airwave, which deflects the microphone membrane and is than registered by the microphone. But if I blow air onto that membrane it is only deflected in one direction as long as the wind blow goes and it does not create a \u201esound\u201c. Can this wind even create a soundpressure?Can you damage a microphone membrane by just blowing air into it. How much sound pressure can a air blow create?Scuba divers regulary perform a valsalva maneuver. They equalize pressure in the middle ear by pressing air into it. This leads to a deflection of the tympanic membrane, but it does not sound very loud. Why? I thought if blowing wind onto it, there will be a huge soundpressure, like on a microphone without a pop filter.Can you explain it to me? I\u2018m new in acoustics.
