My new job now won't start for another month, and I have already put in my 2 weeks. What can I do? I live paycheck to paycheck.
So I accepted a new job for a decent pay increase of about 15k per year. I was under the impression from the recruiter that I would start April 1. However, because of limited onboarding training sessions, I now won't start until May 1.

The issue is that I have already put in my 2 weeks at my old job expecting to start April 1. March 30 is my last day. So I will be going an entire month without receiving a paycheck.

Does anyone have any recommendations? Can I get unemployment? As I mentioned I live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to go an entire month without some sort of income...

Edit: Also forgot to mention, I have signed the job offer and everything. It told me the hourly pay and what I would be doing, but just didn't have the start date mentioned. I brought this up to the recruiter and she said that they have openings between March thru May to start. I told her march/april would be the best, but I received a letter today saying that I can't start until may

Edit 2: No luck on staying at my old job longer :(. They said they no longer need help with projects or anything. (I  work in consulting, so work is sort of on an as needs basis. I finished all my projects last week). I am going to get my vehicle inspected today to see if I can start ubering soon. Any other suggestions I greatly appreciate. Also I live in Chicago as an fyi.
