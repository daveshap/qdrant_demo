Time span in Lord of Light by Zelazny - age of Yama Re-reading Lord of Light, I'm a bit confused by the timeline. To be exact, by this remark which ruins my previous idea of the colonization time span:<blockquote>  Hear me, country cousin,\" said Jan. \"Do you remember a snot-nosed brat of dubious parentage, third generation, named Yama?</blockquote>But we do know from the very beginning that Yama was half as old as the Celestial City itself and that he was at least thousand years old at the time they resurrected Sam:<blockquote>  I find that hard to believe, after witnessing at least a thousand years of your treachery (Yama to Mara).</blockquote>An additional piece of information is that Tak the ape was at that time 17 incarnations old (about thousand years as well, if we take the usual 60-years reincarnation period in the Temples mentioned in the novel a couple of times).I had always thought that the Celestial City (= human colony) was about 2000 years old, which makes sense (Zelazny often mentions \"ages\that would not work, if the planet was colonized just a couple of ages before). But now I've noticed that third generation mention. If Yama really comes from the third generation of colonists, he should be much younger, as well as the colony itself (even if the generation is 100 years, which is not the case - their bodies do wear out as usual!).Might it be a plot hole? Might it be that I miss something from the text?Maybe we should just consider Yama a grandson of someone among the Firsts (but NOT of their first bodies)? In those terms, Tak of the Archives would be a second-generation brat, being Sam's son, and Tak's child would be the third generation, regardless of the year of birth.
