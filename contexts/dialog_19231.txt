JOSIE: You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
DUFF: Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
JOSIE: I'm trying to help, Duff.
DUFF: Yeah!
JOSIE: I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
DUFF: What the hell could you do?
JOSIE: Day work.
DUFF: 'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
DUFF: No point fixin' it!
JOSIE: What're you going to do?
JOSIE: Don't do that!
DUFF: Watch out!
