BUSTER: Hey, Pete.
PETE: Buster.
BUSTER: Answer me a couple things?
PETE: If I can.
BUSTER: Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
PETE: We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
BUSTER: You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
PETE: Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
BUSTER: Has she been buying any odd things lately?
PETE: Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff. --Lest you call paper odd.
BUSTER: Newspapers?
PETE: No, the typing kind.
BUSTER: Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
ANNIE: Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
PAUL: I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
ANNIE: Don't talk to me like that.
PAUL: Why, what are you going to do? Kill me? Take your best shot.
ANNIE: Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
PAUL: Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
ANNIE: I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
PAUL: Be my guest.
ANNIE: That's disgusting.
