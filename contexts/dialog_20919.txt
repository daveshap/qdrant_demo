RIDDICK: Back to the ship, huh?
FRY: Get out of our way.
RIDDICK: So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
IMAM: Where's Mr. Johns?
RIDDICK: Which half?
IMAM: You mean....
AUDREY: Gonna lose everybody out here....
RIDDICK: He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out. Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
FRY: How many you see?
RIDDICK: One or two.
FRY: Audrey?
AUDREY: Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
FRY: Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
