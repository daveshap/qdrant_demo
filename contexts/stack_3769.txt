Using SVM and Logistic Regression for survival analysis I am trying to use SVM and Logistic Regression for survival analysis but I am not able to properly find the implementation in R or python? I was wondering if it was possible to predict whether a customer, given his features, would survive in the next 30 or 60 days or not? I can predict if he has churned or not at that moment, but not able to say whether he will still be a customer in 30/60 days. I was thinking about adding a weight depending on his last purchase date but not sure if that's the correct way. Can someone help me out on this and tell me if this is a viable method? Or point me to a viable method?Thanks
