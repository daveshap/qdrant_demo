THEO: I came here to have a word with your dad.
SHEILA: What do you want with my dad?
THEO: Business.
SHEILA: Won't your father help you with that?
THEO: Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
SHEILA: Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
KASTLE: So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
THEO: You know who I am?
KASTLE: Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
KASTLE: I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress. Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
THEO: You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
KASTLE: Maybe I can help you. Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey. I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
THEO: What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
KASTLE: It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance. How's Gloria's thumb?
