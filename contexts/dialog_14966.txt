MAC: So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
JUNO: Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
BREN: Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
JUNO: I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
