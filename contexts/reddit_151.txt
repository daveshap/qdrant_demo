Teary Much?
Ok, so I don’t really know how to say this but I’ll  try my best to explain. So, has anyone felt like so worried that they just burst into tears?? That’s how I’m feeling right now, due to a friend of mine feeling depressed. Of course, I didn’t want to ask what happened cause I felt like it would make it worse for the person. I just really care for them and I don’t know what to do..can anyone please help me out, or at least give me advice ??
