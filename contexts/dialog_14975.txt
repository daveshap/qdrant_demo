BREN: Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!

BREN: First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
