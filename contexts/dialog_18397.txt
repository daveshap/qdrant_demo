JEFFERSON: I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
PAINE: The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
JEFFERSON: Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
PAINE: Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
JEFFERSON: Yes, I was--
PAINE: Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
JEFFERSON: Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
PAINE: What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
JEFFERSON: I will, sir! I will! I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
PAINE: Nonsense, Jeff.
JEFFERSON: Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
PAINE: Here--where are you running off to?
JEFFERSON: Well, I'm sort of anxious to get back to the office--
SUSAN: Father--oh.
PAINE: Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
SUSAN: How nice. How do you do, Senator?
JEFFERSON: How--how do you do, Miss Paine? I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
SUSAN: How are the pigeons?
JEFFERSON: Fine--they're fine. Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
SUSAN: Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
JEFFERSON: Oh--you are!
SUSAN: Then you *did* say it.
JEFFERSON: No--I mean--yes--that is--
JEFFERSON: Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again. Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
SUSAN: Goodnight, Senator--
