Am I being underpaid at work?
Hi all!I'm a project manager and estimator for a mid size contruction company in Boston, MA. I normaly do around $2mm in jobs each year and bring in around $400-600k in profits to the company each year. I am also an architect and design projects for the company to be done as design/build jobs (I've designed a $1mm+ house, a 2 story office building and a 27 unit mix use residential building).

I'm currently being paid $44 an hour without benefits. No healthcare, no IRA, 401k, dental, nothing... I just get a $3k bonus each christmas. That brings my total to around $95k. However... I can't seem to make that income work... I can't find a home that I can afford (everything is over $500k here in Boston and they repairs...) I'm in my early 30s and want to start having a family but we can't afford to have kids right now. I think my salary is good, but not in Boston. I would be more than fine with this salary in places like Texas or Florida where you can find nice/cheap houses.

I've been thinking about asking for a $12k raise but I'm worried it might get rejected, thoughts?
