ATHOS: Recent hours have been a shock.
PHILLIPPE: Perhaps not as much as you might imagine. When tutors answered every question except those about who I was. When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me. But a king...
ATHOS: Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand. Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
PHILLIPPE: There is... wrath... in me. I have learned to hide it. Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened. Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost. Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see! What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
ATHOS: The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
PHILLIPPE: What is its antidote?
ATHOS: I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
PHILLIPPE: You look so sad. Is it something I have done?
ATHOS: It is something I have done -- or did not do.
PHILLIPPE: What is that?
ATHOS: I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
