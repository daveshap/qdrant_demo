MICHAEL: I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
ROWAN: He can't hurt us, Michael. It's us - our love. He can't find a crack in it. He can't find a way in.
MICHAEL: Maybe he's just - waiting...
ROWAN: If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
MICHAEL: Ro, how long have we known each other.
ROWAN: I don't think of us that way - ever.
MICHAEL: Either do I. I love you, Ro. You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU.
ROWAN: Than letts get rnarried, Michael. I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
