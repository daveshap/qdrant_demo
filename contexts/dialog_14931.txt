ELLIE: Anything good?
GRANT: Raptors, mostly.
ELLIE: My favorite.
GRANT: You remember the sounds they made?
ELLIE: I try not to.
GRANT: We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
ELLIE: You think they could talk to each other?
GRANT: To a degree we never imagined.
