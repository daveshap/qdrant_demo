DR. KLEIN: Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
CHRIS: Convulsion?
DR. KLEIN: The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
CHRIS: Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
DR. KLEIN: Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
CHRIS: So, what causes this?
DR. KLEIN: Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
CHRIS: Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
DR. KLEIN: The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
CHRIS: Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
DR. KLEIN: Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
