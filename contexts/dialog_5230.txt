LASZLO: Everything in order?
RICK: All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
LASZLO: Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
RICK: I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
LASZLO: Yes.
RICK: But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
ILSA: Yes.
RICK: She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
LASZLO: I understand.
RICK: Here it is.
