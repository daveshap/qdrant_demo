Foodies who no longer have the energy - I'm writing a cookbook to help people who no longer have the motivation to cook through depression or other issues and instead resort mainly to things like fast food, may I ask what you like to see in it?
Hi everyone!

Please excuse me, I know this is a strange thing to talk about but I was recommended to pop it in here. Please remove it if it isn't allowed (and please excuse my gosh awful English!) !

For those who don't know me (which I'd imagine is everyone) I'm an ex-cook whose been dealing with depression on and off since I was 14.

Thanks to two very close friends I've been able to find ways around the lack of spoons to bring myself to cook again and I wanted to try and share the simple yet tasty recipes with people who share that same feeling.

Whilst it's a LONG way in development, I plan on it being a completely free release because it's only aim is to try and help people !

In the latest blog post there is a long(ish) list of things I will be adding, but I would love to know what kinds of recipes you guys would like to see simplified yet still just as tasty ! It can be anything, (even unhealthy ones as there is ways around it!) Vegan - Vegetarian - Meat feast or mixed!

I would also like to know if you believe this could actually be helpful. I have received some good feedback from those I pitched it to (although the website is not at all as far advanced as the book, I'm still working on that!) I would love to have a wider range of feedback than my own little circle !

Edit: Oh my goodness guys! I was expecting this to tank but instead it's taken off ! I want to say thank you so very much for the support, I will do my very best to implement everything you guys have suggested and make it as good as possible!
