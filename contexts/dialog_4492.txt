DIGNAN: I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
BOB: Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
DIGNAN: That could be anybody's.
BOB: They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
DIGNAN: Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
BOB: The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
DIGNAN: So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
BOB: I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
DIGNAN: How long has he been in there?
BOB: I don't know.
DIGNAN: Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
BOB: We'll have to see when we get back.
DIGNAN: What do you mean get back?
BOB: Well, obviously, we got to go back.
DIGNAN: Bob, that makes no sense.
BOB: Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
DIGNAN: This could be a trap.
BOB: Come on, Dignan.
DIGNAN: Don't Come on
BOB: I'm going back.
DIGNAN: Not in that car you're not.
BOB: Watch me.
DIGNAN: Good luck, since I got the keys.
BOB: Give me the keys, Dignan.
DIGNAN: I can't do that, Bob.
BOB: Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
DIGNAN: Don't threaten me, Bob.
BOB: Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
