JIM: Want to read any books? Take your pick! Isn't this the craziest?
JUDY: Hi.
JIM: Hi.
JIM: What?
JUDY: Your hand's all wet and it's shaky. You're so funny.
JIM: Why?
JUDY: I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato. That was nice.
JIM: Maybe he's scared of the dark.
JUDY: Are you?
JIM: Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
JUDY: You don't need to do that.
JIM: There's something I should tell you, Judy.
JUDY: I know already. We don't have to pretend now.
JIM: What a relief!
JUDY: Is this what it's like to love somebody?
JIM: You disappointed?
JUDY: Funny Jimmy. You're so clean and you--this is silly.
JIM: What?
JUDY: You smell like baby powder.
JIM: So do you.
JUDY: I never felt so clean before.
JIM: It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
JUDY: I love somebody. All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody. And it's so easy. Why is it easy now?
JIM: It is for me too.
JUDY: I love you, Jim. I really mean it.
