HEATHER: Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
TOM: But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
HEATHER: But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
TOM: If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
HEATHER: But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
TOM: We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
HEATHER: Can you believe that was me?
TOM: Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
HEATHER: So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
TOM: Everything.
