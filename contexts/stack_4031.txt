I want to travel to the Netherlands as a non-EU national, but my Russian passport expires in 1 month Here is what I have.I am 17 years old, and I have a Russian passport, currently living in greece.I've been living in Greece (a European country) from the age of 2.I also do have a residence permit that expires in 2021.My mother doesn't have a European/Greek passport, but she is married to a Greek/European citizen.I want to go to the Netherlands for 2 weeks, with a return ticket. However, 2 weeks after my return, my passport will expire. Basically, my passwort will NOT expire during my stay in the Netherlands, but it will be expire 1 month from today.I have traveled to the Netherlands last summer, using my Russian passport and my \"residence card of a family member of a Union citizen\". I could go through the Greek and the Dutch checks with ease, and I did not need a visa.Is it definite that I will be stopped from boarding the plane, since my passport expires in a month? (While it should not expire 3 months after my return, since I heard that's a rule).Take in consideration that I cannot renew my Russian passport more than 2 months before it expires, and it takes 2 months to succesfully renew it. This basically makes it impossible for me to travel anywhere in the EU for this small gap of time. What if I was an adult with a job? It doesn't make sense.
