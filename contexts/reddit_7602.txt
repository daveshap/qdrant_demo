Almost done with grad school with no immediate future plans.
Hi, I had posted a while back about completing the first draft of my master's dissertation. Anyway, the review meetings with my supervisor went well (as well as they can get on video call and email) and I just have a few corrections to make before I submit the final document. I also have a viva to pass. Hopefully, by the first week of June, I will be an MA graduate. 

All this is nice and I am really happy about it, but I can't help but feel worried about the future. I have no plans to jump into a PhD at the moment and was hoping to look for a job and get some real-world experience. (I have always been a student, went into my undergrad and post-grad one after the other.)

But the COVID 19 pandemic has derailed everything. All the potential job interviews I had have been cancelled. I just feel very uncertain about what to do next. Should I just wait it out and apply to places around July-August? I just don't know what to do.
