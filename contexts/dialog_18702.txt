SOFIE: All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
MUMFORD: Um-huh.
SOFIE: First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
MUMFORD: I'm glad.
SOFIE: Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
MUMFORD: I don't follow you.
SOFIE: I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
MUMFORD: Okay...
SOFIE: The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
MUMFORD: I think so.
SOFIE: I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
MUMFORD: What was that?
SOFIE: Transference!
MUMFORD: Transference.
SOFIE: Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion... ...that I am in love with you.
SOFIE: Hello?
MUMFORD: Hello.
SOFIE: I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
