BRADLEE: I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story-- --you think I like being aced out?
BERNSTEIN: --what?--
WOODWARD: --The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
BERNSTEIN: --the lookout in the Motor Inn?-- --he say anything we don't know?--
WOODWARD: --just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
BRADLEE: --it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
BERNSTEIN: --there's nothing new in it--
BRADLEE: --it makes the break-in real--it's a major goddamn story-- --I'm not going to kick ass over this, but I'd like you to know I hate getting beat, I just hate it-- don't forget that I hate it--
BERNSTEIN: Goddamnit--
WOODWARD: --shit--
BERNSTEIN: --we gotta top the Times--
WOODWARD: --I know, I know--
BERNSTEIN: --if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
WOODWARD: --shit, who do we know?--
BERNSTEIN: --I know a lawyer at Justice--
WOODWARD: --has he got an ax?--
BERNSTEIN: --almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
WOODWARD: Then he's got an ax. Call him anyway.
