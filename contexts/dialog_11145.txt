HANNA: Mr. Boone. He is an interesting friend.
WHALE: I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
HANNA: No. But someone you can talk to.
WHALE: Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
HANNA: I have my family. Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
WHALE: Of course. How is the old boy these days?
WHALE: It needs a hat. There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
HANNA: It must be up in your old room. I will look.
