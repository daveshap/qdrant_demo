All I feel I care about is escapism, what am I to do?
So there’s no doubting I have depression/anxiety. All the symptoms, and I’ve taken medication for it, so this may be a big thing in factoring how I have the motivation to do stuff.

When I’m at work (IT Support), all I can think about is forms of escapism. Beautiful music, landscapes, cosying up in my blanket playing a game that takes me away (that I just don’t get to do now). As stupid as it sounds, I’d love to land in a career that allows me to marvel at certain things like this. I love games (maybe a game journalist, developer, etc). I love nature (maybe a marine biologist...).

This sounds so stupid and naive but I am a lost soul, it’s getting progressively worse and it’s destroying my entire wellbeing. Everything I do to escape is saddled with guilt that I should be concentrating escaping my job and trying to do something towards enjoying my day to day life, then I may feel like I shouldn’t have to try and escape so much.
