Anyone else really just looking forward to college so they can have a fresh start?
I feel like I’m so behind in everything and I’m drifting away from my friends I feel like I can’t get my life back together. I can’t wait to just start college so I can have a fresh start and just feel like I actually can keep things together again. 

lol anyone else with me?
