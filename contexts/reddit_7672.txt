I want to work for the start-up that currently funds my research when I graduate. How should I do it?
Dear all, I'm a PhD-to-be (planning to graduate next spring). I invented some medical device (patent pending) as my thesis, and a biotech funds it. I'm kind of interested in working for them after I graduate so I could keep working on this thing. What kind of process should I go through? What position/pay grade should I go for? 

I want to get an idea before talking to them, so I can know what to expect. Has anyone had this kind of experience? Thank you so much!
