How to get dual boot (Ubuntu/Windows) option enabled? My first disk has windows and second disk (not partition) has Ubuntu. But the first disk was removed during ubuntu installation and plugged back after installation. Now my system boots with only one OS depending on the disk with higher priority in the boot list. One of the attached question talks about boot repair or about reinstalling grub-efi. Which is not the case here. My system boots perfectly but based on the drive selected. The other attached question is valid with the given assumptions being true, which are false in my case. Is there any way to get OS selection list at boot time?
