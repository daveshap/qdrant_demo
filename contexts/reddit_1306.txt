Does anyone get embarrassed over the littlest things?
I hate myself. Today was supposed to be a good day. I’m at the opera house waiting to watch a ballet performance. I got all dressed up so I could look classy. But the performance hasn’t even started yet and I feel like my day is already ruined.
When I got here in the morning, I asked a worker where the rooftop resturaunt was. He told me to go straight and then left, but he wasn’t very clear so I accidentally turned in the wrong direction, and a lady held open the door for me and I said “thank you.” Then, the worker said “Miss, that’s the wrong direction” and I was so embarrassed. I said “sorry” to the lady and went on my way. (Mistake 1)
Then, I decided not to eat at the restaurant after all, and decided to eat at Ladureé. When I was at Ladureé I got up to go to the restroom and when I was walking back I slipped on a heel, but luckily I didn’t fall because I held on to the railing. Luckily no one noticed, but I felt so embarrassed. (Mistake 2)
Lastly, when I got to the opera house I went to the coat room and gave my coat to the lady to store. She told me to have a good time at the performance and I told her “you too.” I feel so stupid. (Mistake 3)
I just feel like this day can only get worse and my heart just feels like it’s sinking. I feel like everyone is watching me and judging me. I’m so timid and awkward and scared of what people could me thinking of me. If anyone can give me advice on how to make this stop I would greatly appreciate it.
