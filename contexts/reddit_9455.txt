Target Cartwheel App is the best life hack no one talks about
The Target shopping app has a secret feature that makes it the best for online shopping.   Unlike on the website, there is no minimum purchase for free shipping for RedCard holders.   It's free to get a Redcard(no fees like Prime) and anyone can get one. There are two types - a debit card and a credit card but both give 5% off for all purchases.   

The free no-minimum shipping is a crazy good deal.  In my experience it's usually about 2-3 days to arrive and the prices are generally the same as store prices.

So, when you're too broke to get to the store and really need a new toothbrush or a bag of rice, Target will take 5% off and ship it to your house for free.
