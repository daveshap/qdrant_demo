Is assuming a binomial distribution appropriate when the number of possible successes is fixed? I have some data about people applying for a service - they are either successful or not successful in their application. I'm using logistic regression to investigate whether there is a relationship between being successful and some demographic variables (e.g. gender, ethnicity). There is a maximum to the number of people that can have access this service. So each application isn't independent - whether or not a particular person is successful can depend on who else applied. Is my use of logistic regression appropriate, given applications aren't independent?
