MITCHELL: I'm in a car wash.
ZOE: A car wash! Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash. Make sure you've got the windows closed.
ZOE: Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window? How old was I, Daddy? Five or six? I got absolutely soaked, remember?
MITCHELL: Why are you calling me, Zoe?
ZOE: Why am I calling you? You're my father. I'm not supposed to call you? What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
MITCHELL: Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
ZOE: So what's the problem?
MITCHELL: The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
ZOE: 'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm? Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
