BEN: Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
SERA: And do what... rot away in a room? We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
BEN: Will you lighten up, please?
SERA: One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
