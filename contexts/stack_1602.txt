Fast attack, slow release envelope detector EE novice here. I want an envelope follower for a +/- 1V audio signal which immediately (i.e. within a couple of milliseconds, ideally) increases to the amplitude of the input signal, then falls off exponentially (with decay rate adjustable by a pot) as long as the input is below the current output value. I know how to make a basic envelope follower with diode, resistor, and capacitor but I believe that will have a slow attack response when the RC time is long. Any pointers for how to approach this?
