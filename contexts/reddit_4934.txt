How do you respond when your boss asks you if you're happy?
I'm 58 years old and newly diagnosed with depression for the first time in my life. I was promoted at work and the stress was unbearable and threw me into this. Depression. I turned the job down but my life hasn't gotten any less stressful.The location where I work doesn't qualify for FMLA although we do have a leave of absence. I'm sure I'm going to be fired soon because after 6 years on this job I'm making mistakes. Fear doesn't really help anxiety does it? So my boss asked me "are you happy?. I don't even know what I answered; I think my mouth worked like a fish out of water. I don't know if I said I'm trying or I was, or what?the look on her face was like yep that says it all.
Edit to update: 
My anxiety meds kicked in enough that I could talk to my boss calmly. I explained that this wasn't just a case of the blues. She asked if a less stressful position would make a difference. I told her I thought it might. but of course I'll have to take a cut in salary. I guess that's better than no job.
I wish I'd never taken that promotion. It's cost me my career my sanity and my income.
