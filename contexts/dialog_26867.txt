WIZARD: First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
DOUGH-BOY: Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
WIZARD: The kind with a brush.
WIZARD: Travis.
TRAVIS: Hey Wizard.
DOUGH-BOY: Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
WIZARD: Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
WIZARD: Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
DOUGH-BOY: No.
WIZARD: Yeah.
DOUGH-BOY: Could you see anything?
WIZARD: Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
DOUGH-BOY: What did you do?
WIZARD: Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think! What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
DOUGH-BOY: Yeah.
WIZARD: What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic. So howsit?
TRAVIS: Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
DOUGH-BOY: Stick up?
WIZARD: Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said Look
DOUGH-BOY: You said that?
WIZARD: Well, I said, Lady
DOUGH-BOY: And what happened?
WIZARD: She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
DOUGH-BOY: A real skunk.
