MULDER: Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
SCULLY: This is great. This is fitting.
MULDER: What?
SCULLY: I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
MULDER: We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
SCULLY: -- of what exactly?!
MULDER: That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
SCULLY: They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
MULDER: Yeah, well they may this one.
SCULLY: What do you mean by haul? What are you not telling me here?
MULDER: This virus -- it...
SCULLY: Mulder --
MULDER: It may be extraterrestrial.
SCULLY: I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this. Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
MULDER: Been where?
SCULLY: Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
SCULLY: What do you think it is?
MULDER: I have no idea.
SCULLY: This is weird, Mulder.
MULDER: Very weird.
SCULLY: Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
MULDER: Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
SCULLY: Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
MULDER: For the purpose of what?
