Anyone else feel like they miss being wanted/ pursued more than the person they lost in a break up
Been spending a lot of time reflecting during this quarantine and I realized I miss the feeling of being wanted more than the guys themselves. I love having someone to talk to who Iâ€™m comfortable telling anything and everything too.
