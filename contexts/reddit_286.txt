I failed ☹️
I should be graduating this December, but one of my professor give me a failing grade even it is my 2nd take to his subject. I feel so devastated. There are so many people who are so very disappointed with me and I can't do anything with it. I did my best but my best wasn't enough. Now I don't know how to deal with my financial issue. I feel so worthless and useless. I don't know what to do. ☹️
