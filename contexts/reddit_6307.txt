Finally landed a job, but...
Firstly, I am very thankful for this sub.  Cheers all around.  Lurking here was an absolute lifeline.

Second, I finally did it!  Took awhile but well, here we go!  I'll be starting as a water treatment specialist three weeks from today after my background check gets cleared.

Finally, the but part.  It is on a condensed schedule, so three twelves from morning to night and four twelves every other week.  I'm scared!  I'm so used to sitting around doing very little.  My sleep routine is kinda sucky, waking up around 10 and going to bed around midnight.  I'm also out of shape by being so sedentary.  So jumping into this type of schedule freaks me out, man!

Any advice on how to acclimate myself for success?  Advice for getting through twelve hour shifts?

Thank you all!
