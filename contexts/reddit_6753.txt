Question
I had a in person interview last week and got an email/call today from my recruiter that I had a positive review and will be moving forward in the hiring process. I was told I would have to wait another 2 weeks for management approval if I am proper candidate. Should I assume I got the job or still go out and job hunt? My recruiter also told me if I have any questions to feel free and ask, is there anything I should say?

Edit: fixes
