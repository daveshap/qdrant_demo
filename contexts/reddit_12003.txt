Didn't get into my major and my shitty roommate did
At my college, we apply to/declare our majors in our second year of college so the first two years are spent trying to get the prerequisites for your future major. I wanted to major in something that you had to apply to so I knew their was a risk of getting rejected but I was still very passionate about it. The major is a global studies major, so it involves a lot of sensitivity and an open mind. The problem is that my shitty roommate also wanted to apply. My roommate is very rude and self-centered. She's very set in her ways which are usually offensive. She's also very lazy and if we are taking the same class, I usually get the better grade. Not only is she just really not my cup of tea but she's also racist and has said racist remarks about me (I'm hispanic). My first year was a little rough and my GPA was less than stellar. Fast forward to the beginning of my second year and I've raised my GPA but not by a lot because it was low to begin with. My roommate also has a shitty GPA but is taking easier classes. Spring semester comes and we both apply to the major. We both get our rejections within the same week. Then a couple of days later, she gets an acceptance letter saying that the program let more people in. I wait a week and still do not get an acceptance. Now I've been depressed for like two weeks and I don't know how to feel better.
