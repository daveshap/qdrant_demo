LOGAN: I'm a Sandman!
BILLY: I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
LOGAN: I feel sorry for you, boy!
BILLY: For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
LOGAN: No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
LOGAN: Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months? What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
BILLY: Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
LOGAN: No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here. If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
BILLY: Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
