GENERAL: Thea is so like her —— in every feature ——
OLIVER: If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
GENERAL: She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
OLIVER: How did she die?
GENERAL: I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back ——pale -- sick -- she died --
OLIVER: Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
GENERAL: In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
OLIVER: I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
GENERAL: You are my friend.
OLIVER: And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
GENERAL: If I told you —— you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you —— the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -—
OLIVER: That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle —-
GENERAL: Listen to what I say --
OLIVER: When you make sense I'll listen.
OLIVER: Where's Thea?
CATHY: I think she went to bed —— I saw her going toward the house
