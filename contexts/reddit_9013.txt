Are there laws banning out of state political contributions?
There are US laws banning foreign influence in US elections
[52 USC 30121: Contributions and donations by foreign nationals](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:52%20section:30121%20edition:prelim))

Ate there any to stop similar interference in state politics from other states?
