Can a damaged dishwasher heating element break something else? A piece of plastic melted on our dishwasher (66515113K216) heating element, and within a few weeks the heating element failed at that spot. We ran the dishwasher without a heating element for a few more months, drying the dishes by hand, before I ordered the replacement part.Once installed, the new heating element didn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t imagine multiple things failed at once, unless the fault in the old heating element may have \u201cblown\u201d something else.I replaced the high limit thermostat as it seemed like the most likely culprit, but no joy.Before I go and replace every part in this dang thing, I\u2019d like to apply a method to my madness. I do have a multimeter, and both new parts seem to conduct just fine (as does the original high limit thermostat, dangit).Thanks!
