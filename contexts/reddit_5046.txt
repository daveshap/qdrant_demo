Am I at a disadvantage?
So I'm 18 now, but I haven't gotten a job yet. I tried applying to several part-time entry-level positions in my city, but I got nothing for it, no interviews or anything. While I tried to remain positive about my chances, I decided to focus more on my extracurriculars in school, as well as my grades so I could get into my desired discipline in university. Even throughout my first year, I applied to several entry-level positions, and yet I received nothing again, which began to really worry me, as most of my friends by then had a job, or had previously worked part-time. I am feeling really stressed out and increasingly frustrated by this, not only because I'm not getting hired, but also because several people I know are still getting hired, so what exactly am I doing wrong? And am I at a disadvantage because of this?
