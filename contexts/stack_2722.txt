Superposition of waves and energy transferred A wave transfers energy. I was reading about the superposition of two waves, where the amplitudes of the two waves added up to produce a resultant wave.So I began wondering about the energy that is now being transferred in this resultant wave. Is it the sum of energy being transferred by both waves?Please help me understand.
