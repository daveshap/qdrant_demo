LEE: Oh, Elliot!
ELLIOT: Hi.
LEE: What are you doing here?
ELLIOT: Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
LEE: Oh, what, in this section of town?
ELLIOT: Yes. Yeah, I-I'm kill--
LEE: You're out looking here?
ELLIOT: Well, yes, I'm killing time. I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
LEE: Ohhhh!
ELLIOT: How about you?
LEE: Oh. Well, I live--
ELLIOT: Oh, yes! You live near here, don't you?
LEE: Yes, I do.
ELLIOT: Where are you headed?
LEE: Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness. Well, why do you still go to those? You never tough alcohol.
LEE: Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick. I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
ELLIOT: Oh. You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
LEE: Yeah, unhappy and fat. And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
ELLIOT: I'll never understand it. You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
LEE: Oh, God.
ELLIOT: I think to myself what problems could she possibly have?
LEE: Don't let me get started on my childhood. Oh, you know what? There is a bookstore.
ELLIOT: Yes? LEE A couple of blocks from here. If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
ELLIOT: Yes?
LEE: Yeah, you would.
ELLIOT: Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
LEE: Yeah, sure.
