JIM: There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
STEPHANIE: Yeah.
JIM: Where the hell is my car?
STEPHANIE: Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
JIM: No -
STEPHANIE: Neither did I. I'll make it up to you, I promise...
CRAWFORD: I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
GRAHAM: I don't want to talk about it anywhere. If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
CRAWFORD: How much do you know?
GRAHAM: What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' Confessions?
CRAWFORD: Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. None of them knew that;
GRAHAM: What else did you keep out of the papers?
CRAWFORD: Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
GRAHAM: Somebody hurt him?
CRAWFORD: Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
CRAWFORD: Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
GRAHAM: No.
CRAWFORD: Why not?
GRAHAM: The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
CRAWFORD: And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
GRAHAM: You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
CRAWFORD: Last two like this we had, you caught.
GRAHAM: That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
CRAWFORD: That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
GRAHAM: I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think. I came down here to get away from all that.
CRAWFORD: You look all right now.
GRAHAM: I am all right.
CRAWFORD: If you can't look anymore, I understand...
GRAHAM: As long as they're dead...
CRAWFORD: These are all dead, Will.
GRAHAM: Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
CRAWFORD: I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
MOLLY: He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
GRAHAM: What did he want?
MOLLY: He asked how you are.
GRAHAM: And you said?
MOLLY: I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
GRAHAM: I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma? I got a diploma and everything.
MOLLY: You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma. You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
GRAHAM: We have it good, don't we?
MOLLY: All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
GRAHAM: What the hell can I do?
MOLLY: What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
GRAHAM: If I were?
MOLLY: Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me. And Kevin. That's selfish, huh?
GRAHAM: I don't care. He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
KEVIN: Will it keep them out?
GRAHAM: Yeah...
KEVIN: How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
GRAHAM: In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
KEVIN: Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
GRAHAM: Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
MOLLY: Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
CRAWFORD: I have to.
MOLLY: You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
CRAWFORD: Because it's his bad luck to be special.
MOLLY: He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
CRAWFORD: Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
MOLLY: You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
CRAWFORD: Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
MOLLY: No. I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
CRAWFORD: I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
GRAHAM: Thanks for the lift.
OFFICER: I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
GRAHAM: That's right.
OFFICER: There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
GRAHAM: Thanks.
