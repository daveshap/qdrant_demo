BARRY: Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
LANCE: Where you goin?
BARRY: I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
LANCE: Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
BARRY: Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
LANCE: Ok.
BARRY: Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
LANCE: Ok.
