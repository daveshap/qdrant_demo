From highschool dropout to 85k a year
***\*EDIT\****  **Thanks for the gold stranger! And thanks for all the really positive feedback, i'm glad my story has inspired some people. There's a lot of stuff i left out as well just to keep it somewhat condensed.  But i have worked really hard the last 7 years and have learned a huge amount about wireless industry. I am also fortunate i found a good company willing to promote me based on my own merit and not holding my past against me. There were countless times where i felt down and out. But i always pushed through and i'm not done yet. I really want to expand on my current skill set and improve even more. So cheers to everyone, thanks for all the praise. And i hope we all make it someday.**

I doubt anyone will read this as its super duper fucking long. But i don't have many close friends that i can share my excitement with. So here we go.

I was a very difficult kid as a teenager, my parents split when i was 12 and my older brother and sister had just left for college being only 1 year in age difference. So I was alone to be shuffled back and forth between them. My dad found a rebound pretty quick like 2 months after and spent 90% of his energy on her. My mom developed a bad drinking habit getting wasted every night. My dad was never open to talk about anything so that's kind of how we were raised. I never told my brother or sister what went on hell we weren't close only seeing each other on holidays or a call on a birthday.

I saw what they had through their teenage years and what I got instead and I despised it. I started getting in trouble in school, got expelled quickly in 6th grade 3 weeks before the end of the year (after amassing over 60 write ups, so many suspensions etc) and they passed me anyways.

Switched school districts a bunch over the years back and forth between my mom and dad house who lived 45 mins apart. Getting expelled 7 times, and even expelled from alternative schools. Last time I got expelled from the 9th grade for the 2nd time my family made the choice to send me to a military school GED program at the age of 15. I almost got kicked out of that for getting into 2 fights and had a lot of disciplinary platoon where we had to workout for 2 hours in the morning if we got in trouble. But the leader of the program kept me in for some reason and I got my GED 3 months later right after turning 16.

I ended up still being bad with nothing to do now. Mom moved to another state. And my Dad kicked me out after finding weed at the house (oh btw he had 2 more kids with my stepmom who were 3-1 at this time). So at age 16 I couch surfed with friends. Got arrested 3-4 times for weed, under age drinking, evading police (running from party) ended up having warrants put out on me when I missed court. 6 charges 30 days each run consecutive since I skipped court.  At this time I'm 18 now. I get pulled over while riding with a friend for a headlight being out and they ID everyone in the car and arrest me.

I get sent to jail which I had been before on all my previous charges. Next morning they transfer me to the state prison evaluation center because anybody in my county with a sentence of over 90 days goes to prison to serve time instead of jail. I got to the evaluation center and it's where everyone gets classified to see what level yard they are going to, what gang they're in etc. Everyone in the state who goes to prison stops through this center for 90 days. Anyways I stay in here with 2 cell mates on 23 hour a day lock down (cant let us out cause we're all unclassified), only out to eat then get locked right back up.

It sucked the only person who wrote me was my friends mom who I had been living with who cared about me like a son. She even hired a lawyer to help get me out god bless her. My mom called too actually she was always very nice over the years but lived far away and had her own problems. I dont blame my dad for not contacting me, he gave me plenty of chances over the years and I always did the wrong thing I was and am still very stubborn. So I got out after 2 months time served thanks to the lawyer.Â 

Now over the years up to this point i have had several entry level jobs. Fast food, waitor etc. And i was always a very hard worker every boss i ever had loved me. I had grown out of most of my bad habits but had no way to support myself and was still living with a friend.

&#x200B;

Anyways my moms boyfriend had a job opportunity for me to come work with him in another state as a flagger and he was a lineman. Well i did that and quickly took over doing most of the work while he would drive the truck and flag and show me what i need to do. Which i didn't mind hes older so i didn't think it fair for him to do the hard labor anyways. So i did this for like 5 months staying in hotels there he payed for until we completed all the work on his current contract.

&#x200B;

So now here i was out of work again. He had been paying me $400 a week under the table which to me was a fortune. And i had no bills to pay so i was banking it all. I had a taste of actually doing something meaning full and i didn't want to let it go. Up until this point i had always been the family fuck up. My brother and sister had their own problems growing up but nothing close to what i did. I felt like an embarrassment to my family and a piece of crap knowing it was all my own doing. My brother and sister were very smart, brother became an engineer with a great company and my sister (who i have never been close with, we only have ever texted happy birthday once a year) was in medical school. I never put blame on anyone but myself only years later realizing the circumstances that had stoked the fire of my troubled youth. Even if i was put in a tough situation as an adolescent it was my fault for how i handled it.

&#x200B;

So here i am no job, on a greyhound going back home knowing i have no where to live and that the place is a bad environment for me because of people, drugs, etc.

&#x200B;

Then i get a call from my moms boyfriend 2 weeks later and he says his friend has work down in Alabama. So i take a grey hound bus down to Alabama and start working on a wireless DAS install there. My first time ever doing this work and i started at $12 an hour 70 hours a week. They had an apartment rented for us employees and i was making a killing at my age thought i had it made. The overtime made my checks actually pretty nice and i banked all of my paychecks only spending per diem we got on my necessities.

&#x200B;

So i loved it and started working my ass off. I sought every day to be the hardest worker there i didn't want there to be a single person out performing me. And the guy who got me the job originally was the foreman of our side of the install. And he recognized my hard work and loved me, he put me in charge of running a crew 2 months in. I was leading 4-5 people running coax cable, installing connectors, placing antennas etc.

&#x200B;

The job ended and the company decided to bring me on full time up in the DMV area. They bumped my pay rate to $15 an hour and had a hotel for me to stay at which they paid. We finished a 6 month project at a nearby stadium and since they're a small company the work was drying up and they had to lay people off. They were gonna send me home and i plead my case on why im a benefit to the company and why i should stay. Let me also add at this point they know nothing of my past because i was embarrassed by it and never shared it, as far as they were knew i was just a kid who finished highschool and didn't want to go to college.

&#x200B;

Anyways they keep me on and start teaching me new things. Mainly all the technical side of the industry. I was taught how to test and trouble shoot antenna systems. So me and a co-worker who had been there 5 years longer than me were tasked with testing cell towers for another company under contract. It was pretty new to both of us but i worked so hard on learning all of it and even researching it on my own time.

&#x200B;

After about 8 months the company who was hiring my company to do the testing was requesting only me out to the sites since i did a good job and was very quick. Once i found this out i negotiated a pay raise to $18 and i got a company vehicle that i was able to take home. Around this time my brothers job brought him into the area since he was leading a project at a local military base repairing all of their water system. And he bought a house and i moved in with him which worked great. Paying $600 a month in rent to him. Little did i know this would benefit me so much down the road. I always kinda idolized my brother. He was a great people persons, everyone loved him. He knew how to talk to girls, he was really smart and he always tried to be a father figure to me when my dad was absent.

&#x200B;

I did this for a about 2 years working an average of 60-65 hours a week. Going above and beyond, and never missing a day of work. Hell i didn't take a sick day for 2 years and was never late and worked every weekend they asked me to even if it was last minute. Well i started to get run down after doing that almost everyday for 2 years and asked for a raise and they pushed me to $23. And we ended up losing our contract with that company testing cell towers. They started doing it themselves to cut down on cost.

&#x200B;

Well a big project came up in DC that was over a year long and my boss choose me to run the whole thing. He really believed in my work ethic. I was the only person there from my company that was experienced, we hired on 6 temp workers who had no experience. I trained them all on every aspect of our job and we completed the job ahead of schedule and everyone was praising me. At this point i was turning 26 and was going to be dropped from my dads health coverage. I called my boss and said i really want a raise i need $25 an hour since ill have to provide my own health care. Well he gave me $25 an hour and the company since we were growing picked up a health insurance plan, as well as 401k with match.

&#x200B;

Once the job ended we got a bit slow again but i started working in the office doing wireless communication designs. Designing DAS systems for a major carrier in all sorts of venues. Office buildings, Stadiums, Concert halls etc... And i picked it up really quick. After about 5 months i was doing all the major designs our company got by myself practically, only asking the engineers in the office for advise when needed.

i end up doing this for quite a while at least 2 years and in that time i found a girlfriend and she ended up unexpectedly getting pregnant. I swear when she told me my life flashed before my eyes. I just didn't think i was at all capable of taking care of a kid i didn't think it was the right time. But we decided to keep it even though we had only been dating for 6 months at the time.

&#x200B;

I just keep busting my ass but i knew i had to make more money. The cost of living here is high and although i had amassed 16k in savings while living with my brother, he was moving to another state. His job had moved again and he wanted to sell the house we lived in now. He ended up renting it to me for a discount, and i actually still live here right now (although im moving in feb.) but it was still more money then i had been spending.

&#x200B;

The baby and frivolous spending with my new girlfriend caused me to almost drain my bank account. We hired some new employees that had experience but were from another company. I found out they were making more than me while doing way less skilled work. This kind of made me resent my company a bit, i wasn't mad at my co-workers hell everyone should fight for as much money as they can. But i was mad at the office, i didn't feel appreciated. I was employee of the years 2 years prior (the only time we ever had an empoloyee of the year) everybody at the company admitted i had the best work ethic etc..

&#x200B;

Well a little over a month ago i was contacted by a headhunter. Someone who worked under me at the big DC project years ago used me as a reference. At the end of the call he asked me about my skill set and said he had some opportunities for me. Well he ended up connecting me with a bigger company in the same area who does very similar work. I had an interview with them for a field tech position (commissioning das sites) and at the interview i blew them away. They actually had me come to a 2nd interview the next week instead now i was interviewing for the Design Engineer role and the CTO sat in on the interview. I completely nailed that interview as well.

&#x200B;

And a week later i got an offer for a position 75k Base salary plus all benefits. I talked with my family and decided it was the right move. I didn't want to get into a bid war with my current company and i thought it would be bad etiquette to say "I was offered XX amount, what can you guys do for me". So instead i wrote out a formal two week notice and sent it in.

&#x200B;

My company was shocked, my co-workers all said they don't know what the company would do without me. I practically can do everything there. My immediate boss asked if there is anything he can do to make me stay. And not wanting to get into a bid war i said no. Next week i was in the office and the owner says "What do you need to want to stay here" I told him the same thing and he ended up telling me to sleep on it and talk to him the next day.

&#x200B;

Well the next day im at the office doing a design and he pulls me aside to talk to me. He says they really appreciate everything that i do and he wants me to stay for all the right reasons. He said he would give me the title of 'Design Engineer' and 85k a year base salary with annual bonuses. I was a little shocked. I knew they would make an offer to keep me, but i didn't expect it to be 10k more. Plus i already have a take home vehicle with them which they pay insurance, gas, maintenance etc. Which i wouldn't get at the other company. So total compensation is like 92-93k a year.

Last year i only made 53k total for the year at $25 an hour. This is a 30k raise and its guaranteed salary. I always thought i was under paid but now i really feel i'm getting what i deserve now. And man it feels good.

Sorry for the super long rant. I just feel really good. Although i never tried to care what people thought of me because i know i'm a good person and work hard. I always felt out shadowed by my siblings, it feels so good to hit this milestone and be able to better provide for me and my family.
