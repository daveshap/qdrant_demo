MYRA: Get well soon.
ROY: Every day in every way.
MYRA: I'll see you when you get home.
ROY: What happened to your hand?
LILLY: Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
ROY: I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
LILLY: Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called. Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
ROY: What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
LILLY: Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
ROY: It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
LILLY: And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
ROY: I like those.
LILLY: You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
ROY: You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
LILLY: That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
ROY: How come?
