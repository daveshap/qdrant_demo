What skills could I learn at home that will significantly improve my employability?
I'm 28 and have been searching for a decent career since returning from a year travelling. The dream is to earn money composing music, which I appreciate is going to take time to establish. 

In the meantime, I want to find a worthwhile job to see me through until then. If not a skill that can be taught at home, are there any basic qualifications that can be attained in a relatively short time and instantly open up new employment options?
