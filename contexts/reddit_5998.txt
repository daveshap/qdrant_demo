How far could I go with a degree in Hospitality?
When I go to college I was set on studying hospitality for my major. But it only looks like the only high paying hospitality jobs are are all culinary. When I'm aiming more for an corporate office environment. Are there any well paying office hospitality jobs out there? Or should I switch my major? Thank you anything helps
