Advice for family vs boyfriend
So I’ve been dating this really really great guy for half a year now. He’s truly the best. He’s so respectful and caring and mature. We are both mature people so our relationship isn’t just a fling and we both treat it seriously, which is really great. My parents know he’s nice and they like him and they know how respectful he is. And his parents adore me. They invited me to his family only birthday party and they even invited me to their family summer vacation. They love me and they’re great people! The problem is that I feel like my parents don’t trust me or him. I’m never allowed to go to his house if someone isn’t home and god forbid I go in his room with him with the door closed. It’s just stressful. He’s such a great guy and he would never do anything like rape me or try to convince me to have sex. And I don’t want to have sex either. No thanks. Not at this age (16). But that’s just me personally, just to be clear I don’t judge anyone who is active and younger than me. But anyway, my mom knows I am very much not interested but she still doesn’t trust me. And my boyfriend and I have had the talk and both are on the same page of “hey I’m not comfortable with sex yet” so we both don’t want to cross that line right now. So where’s the problem. They know he’s a great guy, they knows he’s not gonna rape me, and they know I’m not planning on having sex. SO I DONT UNDERSTAND. And it’s not like his parents the are the same. They have invited me over before but said that they wouldn’t be home and they let me stay late (once I stayed til like 11) they’re great people and they respect and trust us as a couple. But not my parents. Ugh it’s just so frustrating
