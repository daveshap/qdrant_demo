TERRY: Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
EDIE: You don't mind yourself at all, do you. Joey used to race pigeons.
TERRY: He had a few birds. I got up and fed 'em this morning.
EDIE: That was nice of you.
TERRY: I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
EDIE: I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested â€”in pigeons.
TERRY: I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
EDIE: The things that go on.
TERRY: How do you like that one?
EDIE: Oh she's a beauty.
JIMMY: She's a he. His name is Swifty.
TERRY: My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
