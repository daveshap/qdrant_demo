What's arts and humanities grad school (preferably MA) in the US really like?
Hi from a confused European,

I've been accepted to grad school (NELC, Egyptology) at Indiana, and it's made me realise that I know nothing about the American education system. In the UK, our MAs are super independent and there are barely any contact hours per week, with only a few assignments per semester.

Obviously I realise it will differ by subject and discipline, but should I expect regular testing? Do I make my own notes or are you given course notes? Are there lots of presentations and tests or large assignments?

Thanks in advance!
