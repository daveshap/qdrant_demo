HELEN: What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
MATT: Yeah.
HELEN: What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
MATT: Come here. You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
HELEN: Well . . . ?
MATT: Well, he was making love to her.
HELEN: Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
MATT: I tell you, I saw them!
HELEN: In Cluett's office?
MATT: Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
