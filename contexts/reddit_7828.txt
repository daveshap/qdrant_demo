Joining a research lab without any experience in research?
I'm finishing up my first semester in grad school, and I'm aiming for an MS in Computer Science. I'd like to take advantage of all that graduate school has to offer, and helping in academic research in either ML or cybersecurity is something I'd like to do. I've never had any research experience in undergrad, unfortunately and so I'm not confident in my prospects of getting accepted into a lab. Additionally I'm afraid that even if I am accepted, my lack of prior experience might hinder me. Should I try asking a professor, or just not bother trying? Is it too late for me, since my first semester is ending and I'd only have like a year to work with a lab?
