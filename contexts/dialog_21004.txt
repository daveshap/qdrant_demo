ARGON: The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
O'BRIEN: You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
ARGON: Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien. The nanobot has changed that.
SUSAN: If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
ARGON: You don't have to give it to us because Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.
