How do I get employers to communicate by email or text?
This happens to me constantly, an employer will start a conversation by email or text then just randomly call me. I just had one that texted me and I texted back I would like to set up an interview and talk. Then 30 minutes later they just randomly call me. I can’t stop everything I’m doing and have a 30 minute conversation with someone. I’m working and it’s much easier to email or text. How do you stop these random calls when you haven’t even set up an interview? It’s really annoying to me.

Edit: When they call, they don’t leave a message either. I have to debate do I call them back or what at that point.
