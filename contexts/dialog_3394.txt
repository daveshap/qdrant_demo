LOTTE: I have to go back.
CRAIG: Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
LOTTE: I have to go back now.
CRAIG: We'll talk about it in the car.
LOTTE: I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
CRAIG: You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
LOTTE: I was, wasn't I? I was John fucking Malkovich! Take me back, Craig.
CRAIG: Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
LESTER: Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
LOTTE: Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
LESTER: Oh, be still my heart.
LOTTE: Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
LESTER: With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
CRAIG: Dr. Lester...
LESTER: More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
CRAIG: No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
LESTER: I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
CRAIG: No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
LESTER: And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
CRAIG: Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually. In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
LESTER: The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain “doors” which should never be opened.
