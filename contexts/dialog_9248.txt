DUVAL: Removal Point? What're you talking about!
MICHAELS: We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
GRANT: Hold it, Skipper. What happens if we overstay?
MICHAELS: Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
GRANT: How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?
