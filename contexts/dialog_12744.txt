BRENNA: Then you must be at least 70 years old.
TAUPIN: At least.
BRENNA: That's impossible.
BRENNA: It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
TAUPIN: A factor of age.
BRENNA: I hope I never get that old.
TAUPIN: You won't.
BRENNA: I must be insane. Leaving work, ditching cops. All to follow a murderer. A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
TAUPIN: Why are you here?
BRENNA: I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write. But it's not. It's you.
TAUPIN: I see.
BRENNA: I'm not even sure why.
TAUPIN: Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
BRENNA: My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses. I can't stand it. But you're different. It's in your hands. A clarity.
TAUPIN: You are a very perceptive young woman.
BRENNA: Just a little crazy.
