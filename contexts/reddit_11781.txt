Am I pretty? I cannot get this anxiety out of my head.
I'm sorry in advance for posting this since it's kind of trivial and vain but it has really been eating away at me for the past couple of days (and for no reason either!). Sometimes I feel pretty, but other times I feel like I'm deluding myself. There are *so* many girls who look super good and I feel like, compared to them, I'm less attractive because of the abundance of beautiful women. I'm sure this mini-obsession will past in a few days but it has really been all over my head.

I'm not even sure why I care. I don't think the knowledge would make any difference in my life. In all honesty, I'm more of a personality person but, for some reason, this has been bothering me. Maybe because I'm anxious that I won't find a partner or something? I don't know. I wish that there were something existed that could tell me, objectively, if I am pretty. 

Sorry-- this feels semi-ridiculous to post but it has really been bothering me :(
