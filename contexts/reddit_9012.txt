The Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn NY faced widespread outcry after they suffered a long-term power outage that left prisoners with no light or heat. Who currently has oversight over Federal Detention Centers, and how would a 'Federal Monitor' change how oversight is conducted?
In late January of this year there was a [long-term power and heat outage](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/nyregion/brooklyn-jail-no-heat-inmates.html) at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn NY.

The outage took place during cold spike in NY and was widely disruptive to inmates, leaving them with no light, hot water, or heat.

It drew [crowds of protestors](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/nyregion/brooklyn-federal-jail-heat.html) and the attention of [some lawmakers and elected officials](https://www.apnews.com/fdc41f64df494c0c94cd918e1da1757f):

> U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez says she visited the jail with other elected officials Saturday and the heat was uneven and sporadic. She said the inmates had no light in their cells and they “are very angry and complaining.”

The Metropolitan Detention Center has previously been embroiled in issues of mistreatment of prisoners (From the first link):

> After the 2001 terrorist attacks, the inspector general found that officers slammed Muslim inmates face-first against walls and told them they would die in secret. The inspector general also participated in an investigation into the beatings of two inmates by officers in 2002 and 2006.

> More recently, an investigation focused on officers who sexually assaulted female inmates who were on overnight cleaning duty between 2013 and 2016. Two former M.D.C. lieutenants and a correction officer were convicted, including one lieutenant who repeatedly raped a prisoner and threatened to send her to solitary confinement if she reported it.

> Last year, another inspector general report condemned conditions for women housed in an adjacent building. The women were confined to one floor with almost no natural light or time outside.  

This has sparked a request for an 'outside monitor' (From the 1st link):

> Lawyers with the federal defenders, which represents hundreds of inmates at the jail, filed a lawsuit on Monday asking a Brooklyn federal judge to appoint an outside monitor who would have unfettered access to the jail.

> “The I.G. previously has investigated M.D.C. and issued harshly critical reports,” said Ms. von Dornum, the federal defender. “But nothing has changed.”

An 'outside' or ['independent monitor'](https://nypost.com/2019/02/04/judge-orders-lawyers-be-allowed-to-visit-metropolitan-detention-center-inmates/), is probably making reference to a *court appointed monitor* that [has been used](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-jersey/articles/2019-01-18/federal-monitor-gives-newark-police-mixed-grades-in-report) in institutional [corruption cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/nyregion/nycha-federal-monitor-repairs.html) before.

I have a couple of questions on oversight of Federal Detention Centers:

1: Who currently has oversight over Federal Detention Centers?

2: How would an outside monitor change how oversight is conducted?
