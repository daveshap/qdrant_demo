Azure SQL Server External Data Sources Let me preface this what what I'd like to accomplish and see if this is inline with the expectation of using Azure SQL DB.Currently I use a couple Virtual Machines in Azure that use a linked server to execute some stored procedures to hit a database outside of Azure (the external database is in AWS)I'd like to move to use the Azure SQL Server to query an external database but I'm not seeing documentation around setting up an external data source that's just a SQL DB - only elastic within your own Azure network. Is this outside the scope of the product?
