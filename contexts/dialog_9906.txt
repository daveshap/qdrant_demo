HARRY: Evening, gorgeous.
FRANCES: That sure looks like fun... You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
HARRY: Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
FRANCES: Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
FRANCES: Where are we, mean man?
HARRY: Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
FRANCES: I should've known...
HARRY: What?
FRANCES: This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
HARRY: That's right.
FRANCES: ...Take advantage of me.
FRANCES: I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
HARRY: Whattaya think you're in now?
FRANCES: I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
HARRY: Huh?
FRANCES: A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
