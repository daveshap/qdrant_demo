Lifetime goal of earning a PhD, but I'm restricted a bit...
I'm wanting to earn a Ph.D in the many years to come. What I'm battling with is, I'm restricted into only being able to do so online(gotta work to pay for it all). I've done a decent amount of research and have concluded that UK universities are probably my best bet. Not only do they offer shorter programs, but they treat education as such and not a business like in the US. I digress.

When looking around, I've noticed the MSC in psychology are vastly conversion courses, for people who want to be a psychologist and do not have a relevant bachelor's degree. My Bsc is relevant, however, online only PhD programs require a Ma/MSC. 

Is it best for me to stop searching for a Bsc-> PhD online program in psychology and accept the PhD route? Or are there universities that I have missed in my search?

(Notes: yes I know in person is better and I would do so if it was available to me. I have 0 financial aid options, and have to pay 100% out of pocket. To which I must work full time and study part time. No I dont want to complete my PhD in 3 years, that's nearly impossible for my situation. I know it will take 5-8years of PT studying.)
