Is it worth it to leave a high paying job that makes me miserable, for one that pays less but doesn't make me cry daily?

I work in the hospital lab in a very specialized position. Specialized to a point there are only 1500 of us in the country roughly. One of the bigger cons of this is I can't just go work somewhere else. If I had a family that lived here and something happened or I quit, I can't go to the town over or down the road, I would have to move hours away for another job. I feel like I am forever at the mercy of my employer.

I got into 4 different masters programs when I finished college. I did so many different jobs, trying to find the one that felt right. My mom has always been money minded, so when I got into my graduate program with the expectation of making 75k+ a year, she was thrilled and pushed me to do it. I was excited, and this program had a higher salary and a higher liklihood of employment (though limited, they don't tell you that part). I started med school not fully knowing what it was, but got through everything just fine with great grades. During rotation year I remember thinking "Is this what I want to do for the next 30 years of my life?"

I started working at my current job a year ago. Two months in, I was already uncomfortable. The healthcare field is viscious, and our leaders in my group are as well. Since I've started I have seen the revoling door of employment, and have seen 8 people come and go since my first day, only 8 months ago. When I started, I was making 75k, and as a new graduate with more loans than that number I was happy. But as time went on, I became a wreck. My ex left me for a week because I would just come home and cry. I was miserable. I've applied to other places, but it's so specialized and so few positions anywhere even remotely close that I am SOL most of the time. I wondered why the people I worked under during rotations seemed so burnt out and miserable, saying the spark will go away fast, and now I know.

Fast forward to today. Recently it's gotten worse. Everybody's pay got cut at least 20-25%. My hours got increased, and I'm doing 55 hours a week now. I am constantly walking on eggshells waiting to get in trouble for sneezing when I should have coughed, knowing if even a whiff of something not perfect gets out that I will be absolutely fired. 

&#x200B;

Besides the employer issues, this job may physically be killing me. I'm pretty certain I will have a stroke by 40 with all this stress. Once I'm off work, I can't relax. On top of that, my back is constantly hurting, and that's just how it is and nothing can fix or prevent that. This job is also just relatively dangerous, and I've already gotten pneumonia and TB from patients before. 

&#x200B;

My passion is dead. It was short lived, it existed momentarily, but it's dead.

I told my mom months ago I wasn't a fan, she told me it's just a phase. I told her in winter, again, suck it up you don't mean it. Now that the world is falling apart and the hospital is running itself and employers into the ground, I told her again that I'm not in love with this job. It makes good money, but I'm not happy. I can't have a family or relationship and feel happy knowing 1/3 of my day is spent in nonstop worry and anxiety. I told her I want to look elsewhere for other jobs, and she said I am being dramatic and need to stop, they put themselves on the line to hire a younger person, I have debt this is what being an adult is I need to suck it up, and this is just a rough patch. She's mainly concerned with the money I make, and it always. comes. down. to. the. money. At this point, making less than 50k terrifies me because of how she has made me feel over the years.

I have been searching for jobs, and i can find other ones in other fields. I would be making above 50k, but not as much as I am now. I feel like I failed though. I got into my program, I was the head of the student side of things, I was the first to get a job, I graduated, I got my license. I did it, and I don't want to do it forever. I genuinely feel like I am doing something wrong, or I'm a bad person, for feeling this way. I want anything else, literally anything else. Is this a horrible mistake?
