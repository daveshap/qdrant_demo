ELDRIDGE: No wallet, huh?
LARDNER: No identification at all. What're you thinkin', Cecil?
ELDRIDGE: What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here. A mystery or a damn miracle. And by god I can't tell which. Boy, you say you have no idea who you are? That right?
PETE: Yes.
ELDRIDGE: You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
PETE: No. But...
ELDRIDGE: But what?
PETE: Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
ELDRIDGE: What's that?
PETE: It's a Wonderful Life.""
ELDRIDGE: The Jimmy Stewart picture? I remember that one. Saw it over at the Bijou. So, you remember that, huh?
PETE: It's a Wonderful Life?""
ELDRIDGE: Or the Bijou. Either one.
PETE: I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
ELDRIDGE: Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here. Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
LARDNER: By all means.
