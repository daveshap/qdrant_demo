I found out that my most of my coworkers don't like me and went behind my back to get me fired
**EDIT: I did not get fired, but they attempted to get me fired
**
I have been working at a company for around 9 months now and I found out today from my manager that half of the project team that I work with really don't enjoy working with me and feel that my attitude at work is annoying and that I don't represent the company well.

Although some of their critisims are helpful and things that I can work on I heard from other co-workers that aside from this they are looking for excuses to get me fired as they don't really care for me. We work in small teams and travel a lot so there is a lot of one on one time with members of the team. I have always tried to be supportive and learn from them in the field and around customers but I think this may have come off as incompetence when I ask questions to them. 

I'm an extremely extroverted and social person and the team members that are having these problems with me are more introverted and cold in compassion. They don't seem to enjoy their work and they take it far more seriously externally than I do even though I do my job competently I know I can outwardly have a more happy go lucky attitude due to my personality.

What really stings is that what I have asked for feedback from my senior team members they have said everything is fine but they still went behind my back to management instead of trying to address the situation and talk to me directly. 

I'm at a loss because now I know while I'm at work that these people despise me and want me gone but I still have to work with them and try to correct my behavior which doesn't seem to fit me, my work style or my personality.

I know people will say I should just quit or transfer, I'm trying to transfer right now but it looks like that might be slow, and I can't quit my job right now.
**
TL;DR: Found out my coworkers hate me, can't quit, work is becoming unbearable.**
