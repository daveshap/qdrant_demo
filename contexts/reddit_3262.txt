In the final round of interviews for my dream job and I just found out I’m pregnant. Worried about having to announce my pregnancy/take maternity leave so soon after I start. Honestly, how bad will this reflect on me to my potential employer?
This pregnancy was very much planned, and my husband and I were going to take a break from trying until I heard one way or the other about this job. Of course I got pregnant right after we made this decision, and after almost 6 months of no success.

All that’s left now is my in-person interview. The job is all of the parts of my career I love and none of the parts I hate, and working for one of the top tech companies in the country. Plus, it pays almost double my current salary. I’ve been applying to jobs for over a year now, and this is the first one that I’m super excited about.

I don’t even have the job yet, but I’m starting to stress out about having to tell them I’m pregnant a few months in and then taking maternity leave a few months after that. One of the benefits is an extremely generous amount of full-pay maternity leave, so I’d be gone for several months after the baby is born.

I don’t want to look like I’m taking advantage of the company and its benefits. For those who have gone through this situation or know someone/worked with someone who has, how bad does this make me look? Is there anything I can do or say to show them that I value this job and plan to be there for a long time (possibly forever)?
