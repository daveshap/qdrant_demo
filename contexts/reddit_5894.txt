I want a different BA degree
I have a BA in Public Relations with a minor in Communications. It has not gotten me where I want to go in my career life. I want to look into HR or Social Services. I'm not sure I can persuade graduate degrees for these sense my current degree doesn't line up. Can I even get a second bachelor's degree? What should I do?
