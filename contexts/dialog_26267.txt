BETTY: You forgot this.
GILLIS: Thanks.
BETTY: I've been hoping to run into you.
GILLIS: What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
BETTY: I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
GILLIS: Why, you sweet kid.
BETTY: There's one called....Window... something with a window.
GILLIS: Dark Windows. How did you like it?
BETTY: I didn't.
GILLIS: Thank you.
BETTY: Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
BETTY: Is there someplace we can talk?
GILLIS: How about the Rainbow Room?
