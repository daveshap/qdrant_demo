Has anyone here successfully asked for their (or another) job back after leaving?
I left a company I semi built for another opportunity that turned out to be a bad fit and I left. I tried really hard to leave the first co on good terms and obviously had a lot of seniority and a hand in their success. But I think there were some hurt feelings there although not overt hostility. It's now been months, I'm unemployed and my husband just lost his job. I think they might not fill my old role, but could potentially use me in another way. It just feels so awkward and weird to approach and I can't imagine it working out. Has anyone done this? How did you do it?
