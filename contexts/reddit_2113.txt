THANK YOU to whoever suggested I apply to MSU! I just got in with $42,000 a year in merit aid!
I, an international student applying for MechEng, FINALLY have a place to go next year. My senior year and my gap year up until this point were filled with rejections from pretty much everywhere I applied to that could give me finaid. I got into GaTech with zero aid, and that was even more painful. 

So I made quite a dark post here (which Iâ€™ve since deleted) about all the places I got rejected from and my feelings towards this whole process. In the comments, some super great person suggested I apply to Michigan State. With nothing to lose, I did so immediately.

Shortly after, I got in with $32,000 in aid, but the remainder was still too expensive for my dad. I emailed them and detailed my situation, and they gave me $10,000 extra! 

So THANK YOU to whoever that was! You saved my mental health and possibly my life.
