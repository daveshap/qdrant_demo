LUTHOR: You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've -- -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.
EVE: I know...
LUTHOR: She knows. Clever, very clever. And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
EVE: A night on the town instead of under it?
LUTHOR: Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
EVE: I don't understand.
LUTHOR: Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it! Just look at that smog!
EVE: This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
LUTHOR: Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy? Let's get high.
EVE: I didn't bring any --
EVE: Oh. Why? does he live up here?
LUTHOR: Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
EVE: What are you going to do to him?
LUTHOR: Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
EVE: Tea?
LUTHOR: You got wax in your ears?
EVE: What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
LUTHOR: He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
EVE: Danger?? Somebody??? Lex -- where are you going?
LUTHOR: Lex is going bye-bye.
EVE: Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
LUTHOR: Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
EVE: Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
LUTHOR: I'm wearing it.
EVE: I mean the other one!
LUTHOR: What other one?
EVE: You can't do this to me!
LUTHOR: Of course I can. I love you.
