Company called(?) to reject me and told me I’d be considered for other jobs?
I went through a lot in the interviewing process for this company. Had a good phone interview, then the next day they called me for an in-person interview THAT day in a few hours. So, I rushed and got everything together and made it to the interview with a few hours notice. The interview itself was fine, more of a conversation. I thought I probably got the job, since how fast everything was moving. Fast forward to today, I get an email rejection. Ok, whatever. Then they CALL me - to tell me I was rejected, as if one rejection wasn’t enough. The HR person said the feedback was really good, but they just went with someone else. And that I’d be considered for other jobs there. So, I said thanks for letting me know and moved on.

Is this normal? Or does it mean nothing? I know normally I just get email rejections, so the standard “your resume will be kept on file” means nothing. But it felt weird for her to tell me that on the phone, if it was just a formality. 

I guess the good feedback is a good sign, I’m just really bummed.
