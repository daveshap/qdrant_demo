PAUL: I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
APRIL: I'd love to.
PAUL: Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
APRIL: I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
PAUL: Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
APRIL: Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow. It doesn't seem to be too long.
PAUL: Forty-one pages.
