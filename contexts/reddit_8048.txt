Free or low cost online grad school?
I should preface this post by saying that I know this is a long shot, but are there any free or low cost graduate programs that do online programs?  I know that some universities have a big online learning community (Pepperdine, for example) and that some universities are low to no cost (schools in Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, etc.), but does anyone know of a program that is both?  Thanks for the help!
