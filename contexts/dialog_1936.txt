MOONBY: This boat's a mess.
WILLARD: Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
MOONBY: Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz. You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
WILLARD: Why did they attack us?
MOONBY: Simple. They don't want him to go.
WILLARD: You're Australian?
MOONBY: Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
WILLARD: So Kurtz is alive.
MOONBY: Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
MOONBY: But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
WILLARD: Why didn't he shoot you?
MOONBY: I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
