I have nobody left to care. My boyfriend never loved me, my friends never liked me. I'm a fat worthless cow.
I don't have any desire left in me to keep going in life. I spent 1 year with this man and he tore my heart apart. He won. She won. I can't do it anymore. I really just want to die so bad. I've already attempted suicide once. Maybe this time I won't chicken out.
