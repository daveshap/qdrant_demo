Getting rejected for my first job
So i found a job opening for a copy shop near me on some job site, they pay well and they dont require work experience. This was amazing for me because i filled everything they wanted, im 19 and a student with no work experience, they are also open to employing students. I've sent my CV(which isnt very indepth by the way because there isnt much to write about) 5 days ago and i still havent heard of them. The deadline on the site ends in 3 days, should i go to the actual store and ask around or should i keep searching? I've been searching for weeks and this is one of the few jobs that seem decent.
