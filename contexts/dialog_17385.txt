CONNELL: Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
ANN: John Doe.
CONNELL: What John Doe?
ANN: The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
CONNELL: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
ANN: Well, you're catching on.
CONNELL: Who, for instance?
ANN: Anybody! Er, erâ€”Beany'll do!
