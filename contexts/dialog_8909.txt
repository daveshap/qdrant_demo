JACK: Hey, Frank.
FRANK: You recognized me.
JACK: Just a lucky guess.
FRANK: So what do you think?
JACK: Very realistic.
FRANK: Yeah, well, what can I say? Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
JACK: Yeah.
FRANK: Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
FRANK: You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on. Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit. Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move. We could use another appetite.
JACK: Thanks, but I've got plans.
FRANK: All right, but if you change your mind, let me know. I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
SUSIE: Well, well. Ho, ho, ho. You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
FRANK: For the kids. Merry Christmas, you two. Don't forget. We leave the twenty-sixth.
SUSIE: He do that every year?
JACK: Every year.
SUSIE: Aren't the kids asleep?
JACK: Every year.
SUSIE: So why's he do it?
JACK: I guess in case one year they're not.
