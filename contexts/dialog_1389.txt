JESSE: You have no shame.
BOB: Not yet. But I'm hoping.
JESSE: I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
ZEE: You didn't want to farm?
JESSE: I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
ZEE: A river pirate.
JESSE: Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
ZEE: Thank God you grew out of that. You did grow out of that, didn't you?
JESSE: Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
ZEE: You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
JESSE: Not if I find the right girl.
ZEE: And what's this right girl like?
JESSE: Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
ZEE: Where will you find such a girl?
JESSE: Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
