PINKERTON: The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
JESSE: Thanks.
PINKERTON: I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
JESSE: Fair enough.
ZEE: You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
JESSE: Yes ma'am.
ZEE: I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
JESSE: You are a hell of a woman.
ZEE: Don't swear.
JESSE: Yes ma'am.
COLE: Missed you, cousin.
JESSE: Missed you too, cousin.
COLE: You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
JESSE: Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
BOB: Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says Let's ride.""
COLE: He's not bad at it.
BOB: It's tougher than it looks.
JESSE: Where'd you get all these riders?
COLE: We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
