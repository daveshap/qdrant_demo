For Everyone who's suffering with "Friendzone": How do you know if you're friendzoned or not?
So I like this guy.(I'm a girl). We've spent our lunches hanging out together last semester. He helps me study for tests, and I help him study a little as well.But this semester, we have different lunches. He's two years older than me, and I'm not sure if he's treating me like a little sister or a close friend that he wants to get 'closer' with. Also, we've got this inside joke going: He wanted to adopt me as a pet. I am his pet now, and he always makes these jokes about 'I'm not feeding you O:<' and 'go make me a sandwhich' I'm a freshman btw, and I'm not sure which way this is going. My friends all think that he's acting a little kinky, that whole pet thing, and they think he likes me. The thing is, I'm not sure if I'm FRIENDZONED (idk how that feels)or just a close friend. Any advice?
