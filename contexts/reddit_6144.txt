Heading back to toxicity
I’m in a unique position here and need some help..

I started a paralegal job (after 3 years in the field) at a firm one month prior to this whole corona ordeal. So after one month I got laid off. I collected unemployment and was making more money with that. Now the job wants me back on July 6th. But the problem is the place is very toxic. I’m talking cliques, high turn over rate, unhealthy managers, not the position I applied for, list goes on. On top of all the the commute is one hour each way with traffic and $8 per day in tolls, and only a salary of $45 in the NYC region. I really don’t want to go back - what should I do? It’s not even that I make more money, it’s more so the toxic environment. I remember how miserable I was. I can’t go back to my old job either.
