RAY: Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her. That's bullshit.
HUNTER: What about witnesses?
RAY: We've got three. Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
HUNTER: And what do they say?
GLORIA: Same as him. They saw her come. They saw her go. They saw him follow.
RAY: Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her. I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
