He expects me to come...
I'm in a online relationship with a boy for 3 years now... I'm 18 years old and he is 26 years old... We both live in different countries and he have enough money to come over but he refuses to come over. He expects me to meet him but I can't coz me and my family don't have much money... He also said that he will get a new girl if I won't meet him soon coz he don't want to wait any longer... I don't know what to do... Why don't he just come over? He have no job anymore so he is just home all day but he gets money from his parents and his parents have so much money... He also buys so much anime stuff but he just refuse to come to me
