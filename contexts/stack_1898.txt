The opposite of \"free\" in phrases I'm not a native speaker of English but still it feels wrong to say:paid universitypaid entrancepaid parking paid servicepaid consultation paid healthcarepaid toiletpaid fareOr does it? What would the correct adjective to use instead? I know can easily use \"free\" with all these nouns if I want to say it's free of charge.
