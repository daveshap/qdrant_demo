SONNY: I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
MICHAEL: How's Mom?
SONNY: Good. She's been through it before. Me too. You were too young to know about it. You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
MICHAEL: I can help you out...
SONNY: Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
MICHAEL: Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
SONNY: Theresa.
SONNY: All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
MICHAEL: What?
SONNY: One of them fingered the old man.
MICHAEL: Clemenza? No, I don't believe it.
SONNY: You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
MICHAEL: How can you be sure?
SONNY: On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building. We got people in the phone company. Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
MICHAEL: Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
SONNY: Until the old man tells me different.
MICHAEL: Then wait, Sonny. Talk to Pop.
SONNY: Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs. I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York. The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt. I don't care if we all go down together.
MICHAEL: That's not how Pop would have played it.
SONNY: I know I'm not the man he was. But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too. When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
MICHAEL: All right, Sonny. All right.
SONNY: Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
MICHAEL: Is it like they say? Is he that good?
