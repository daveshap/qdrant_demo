Can't install VLC on Ubuntu, and can't Play films In the past days, i used VLC to watch video tutorials. but occasionally, I met the video can't play correctly and screen stuck problems. I thought it maybe need update system and softwares. So I used command \"sudo upgrade\" tried to fix problem, but unfortunately. my computer also held those problems. even the system and VLC is the last version.So. at past night. I used Ubuntu Software to remove VLC. and from some forums to got \"sudo apt-get autoremove vlc\" \"sudo apt-get auto clean\"..etc..(cause I want to uninstall completely for reinstall) But since uninstall VLC, I will incapable to enable it again.My system is Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and run of VLC 2.2.5. could you can help me to solve those troubles? Thanks :)
