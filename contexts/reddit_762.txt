Guys don’t notice me at school and I think there’s something wrong with me
 Now despite what the title says I’m not really insecure about myself but since freshman year my friends have gotten a lot of attention from the dudes. But no ones ever even glanced at me and me being in my senior year I’ve been feeling a little down lately because all my friends get male attention at school and I don’t .I’m not pressed about it but it would be nice to know that i could be wanted.
