CLAUDE: You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
RAY: Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
CLAUDE: I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
RAY: After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
CLAUDE: I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
RAY: I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
CLAUDE: I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
RAY: That was five years ago.
CLAUDE: I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
RAY: We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
CLAUDE: What?!
RAY: You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
CLAUDE: Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
