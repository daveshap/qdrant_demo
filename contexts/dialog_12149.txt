WOODLY: Ah! You're ambulatory!
HAROLD: What a brilliant diagnosis!
PENELOPE: You know what I want? I want you both to be friends. I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
HAROLD: Nothing would please me more.
PENELOPE: Thank God!
WOODLY: Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today? A touch of malaria, perhaps?
HAROLD: I know malaria. Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
WOODLY: You've been bitten by bats?
HAROLD: Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood. There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
WOODLY: You have chills?
HAROLD: Chills, fevers, sweats. You can describe it and name it after yourself: the Woodly galloping crud.""
HAROLD: You can also describe its cure. I'm eating its cure.
WOODLY: I was going to ask.
HAROLD: Pacqualinincheewa root.
WOODLY: Would you say that again?
HAROLD: Pacqualinincheewa root. Means cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back."
WOODLY: I've never heard of it.
HAROLD: Congratulations. By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
WOODLY: Are you've seen it work cures?
HAROLD: Hundreds.
PENELOPE: I'm so glad you like each other. I was so scared, so scared.
HAROLD: Have some.
WOODLY: Thank you. Thank you very much.
PENELOPE: I believe in miracles now.
HAROLD: Wasn't that sweet of me?
WOODLY: More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people. Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
HAROLD: We have, have we?
WOODLY: That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
HAROLD: Everything about you is the editorial we. Take that away from you, and you'd disappear.
PENELOPE: Harold!
HAROLD: I could carve a better man out of a banana!
PENELOPE: Please--
HAROLD: You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles. You know who filled that bag for you? Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself. Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
WOODLY: Good Lord.
HAROLD: I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root. I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest. Now we cure you with it. Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks.""
