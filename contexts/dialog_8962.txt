EVE: What are you saying? Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
ARCHER: One last time. It's important ...
EVE: You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie! What could be more important than that?
ARCHER: I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
EVE: You want me to tell you it's okay to leave? Okay, go on! GO!
