Should I consider a a job offer 1 month in to my current job?
A couple months ago I was working for a company as a freelancer, I knew my time there was not guaranteed, so I interviewed with other companies. One day, I got an email with a job offer, the same day the boss at my then current place of work, invited me into his office. He had also offered me a position to work for him. 2 offers in one day, sweet! In the end I decided to accept the offer from the new company. Fast forward 2 months, I am one month into my current job. Today I got an email from my old boss, inviting me in and that he has a new opportunity he thinks I would be perfect for and that he is willing to make an interesting offer for me. So should I at least see what he has to say? I don't think that would hurt anything, but what do you guys think? Has anything ever happened to you like this?
