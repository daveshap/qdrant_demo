I have absolutely no passion for any field. How can I find career for myself?
I'm almost 23 and the idea of having a successful career is laughable to me. As the title says, I don't have passion for any field whatsoever. I went co college to become a doctor, but I realized I was too stupid to become one and had no chance of getting into medical school so I stopped and now I realize I absolutely hate my biology degree. I'm in grad school currently, but I will be dropping out because I can't stand it.

I have absolutely no skills or talents. I can't see anything positive I have to offer and I'm sure there will ALWAYS be plenty of people better than me for any job position, so there's no chance any reputable place would hire me.

On top of that, I have crippling depression and anxiety. Every single day is a struggle and I'm feeling shittier and shittier as time goes on. I just don't enjoy life and I don't see much of a point in living. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. You need a lot of money and luck to live a happy life, neither of which I have or ever will have, so I will always be miserable.

How could I possibly ever have a career?
