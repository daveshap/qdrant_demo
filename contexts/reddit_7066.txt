Is this considered abuse at work? Is there anything I can do?
For the past couple of months when my cofounder and I would not be able to find a solution to a discussion immediately, my cofounder would degrade me for my worth, call me names and shout at me.

Every time I am shouted at, I lapse into a trauma where my body start shaking uncontrollably (I assume this is a body behaviour for fear) for about an hour. We're part of a startup incubator, and I brought it up with my program manager on multiple occasions but the only advice I got was to 'give it time and you'll figure it out'.

So I pushed to take professional coaching, so that my cofounder could learn to control their behaviour. We did this for about a month (individually). When I brought this matter up with the coach, the conversation didn't go anywhere except that different people have different styles of communication.

But recently, I was shouted at again in front of a senior program manager, and afterwards, I was again called names in private.

I don't think I can work with this person anymore. It's been affecting me emotionally and physiologically.

I was wondering if anyone's had a similar experience to this? What advice would you give yourself if you were in my shoes? Any ideas on what options I have to solve this problem?
