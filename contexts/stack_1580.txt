What circuit can be used to match input to output voltage by using an opamp? What is the simple way matching an input voltage range to a desired output range.To be more specific with an example: If I want to convert/match 0V-5V input range to 7V-15V output range linearly, is it possible to do it with an opamp, feedback and a potentiometer ect? I can use a +/-15V dual supply. What should be the topology?
