A database differential backup without a full backup At 10 pm, I scheduled a SQL Agent job to do a daily backups with the schedule:Daily Full: 22:00Differential: Every 4 hoursLog: Every 30 minutesNow when I check my backup set(let's say at 22:30), I see that a differential backup has happened without any full backup!!. I was not expecting to see the backup job up and running before 16:00 tomorrow when the first full backup will take place, however, I have a differential backup without a full backup? How is that possible?
