Loudspeaker / Amplifier \"POPP\" sound I have different sound systems here. Some of them share the \"problem\" that they make a \"popp\" sound when I switch them on or off using the front-panel switch. If I accidentally switch off the socket they are plugged in, it's a very loud \"popp\" or more a \"bang\".I know that some audio systems implement a soft-start circuit to overcome that problem. I can hear some relays click a few seconds after I switch the amplifier on, and from that moment on I can hear the music.My questions:1) Does that normal popp after front-panel switching harm the loudspeaker?2) Does an accidental power-off, which causes that \"bang\harm the loudspeaker or some circuits?3) How should one implement a protective circuit?Is it sufficient to set up a delay-circuit which controls some relays on the output of the amplifier circuit, or is it better to do it in \"stages\e.g. first let the supply start, then give power to the amp and in the end switch on the loudspeaker itself?Best wishes and thanks for your time in advance.
