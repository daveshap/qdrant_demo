LARIVIERE: What the fuck. My day's already ruined. Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
WADE: It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
LARIVIERE: Something bugging you?
WADE: Yeah. A few things.
LARIVIERE: Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
LARIVIERE: Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
JACK: Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
LARIVIERE: You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
JACK: Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
LARIVIERE: No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
WADE: Where'd Twombley get shot?
JACK: In the chest.
WADE: No, I mean whereabouts.
JACK: A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
WADE: You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
JACK: The ambulance guys lugged him up.
WADE: You stayed away?
JACK: Yeah.
WADE: Where'd you get the blood?
JACK: What blood?
WADE: On your sleeve.
JACK: Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
WADE: I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
JACK: Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
WADE: I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
JACK: Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
WADE: Sure you did.
JACK: What?
WADE: Saw him do it?
JACK: What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
WADE: You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
JACK: Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
WADE: There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work. But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
JACK: Yeah.
WADE: Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
JACK: He sure as hell won't.
WADE: Rolfe.
ROLFE: Wade?
WADE: Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
ROLFE: There was something. It happened up your way.
WADE: Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
ROLFE: Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
WADE: No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
WADE: It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
ROLFE: He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
WADE: Who?
ROLFE: Twombley.
WADE: No shit.
ROLFE: You think Jack shot him?
WADE: Well, it was an accident.
ROLFE: They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
WADE: Lillian was here. In Lawford.
ROLFE: Huh?
WADE: The night before the shooting.
ROLFE: How was she?
WADE: Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
ROLFE: Who?
WADE: Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
ROLFE: What happened?
WADE: A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
ROLFE: Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
WADE: Yeah, I guess.
ROLFE: Get some sleep.
WADE: I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
ROLFE: Haven't you already done a bit of that?
WADE: No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
MRS. GORDON: Who are you?
WADE: I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
MRS. GORDON: He's asleep. We were up very late.
WADE: Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
MRS. GORDON: Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
WADE: Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
MRS. GORDON: Something about my father?
WADE: Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
MRS. GORDON: Can't it wait, then?
MEL GORDON: Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
WADE: How's that?
MEL GORDON: I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
WADE: Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
MEL GORDON: What the hell are you talking about?
WADE: I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
MEL GORDON: Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
WADE: Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
MEL GORDON: Hold on!
WADE: Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
MEL GORDON: You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
WADE: Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
MEL GORDON: Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
WADE: Yes. Here's your ticket.
MEL GORDON: You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
MARGIE: Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
WADE: There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
MARGIE: I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
WADE: I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
MARGIE: ...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
WADE: I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
MARGIE: Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
WADE: Money.
MARGIE: Jack doesn't need money.
WADE: Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
MARGIE: Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
WADE: Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
MARGIE: The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
WADE: No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
MARGIE: You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
WADE: No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
MARGIE: But not now.
