DRIVER: What do you think you're doing!
PETER: Huh?
DRIVER: The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
PETER: Oh—the papers—
PETER: That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
DRIVER: Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
PETER: Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
DRIVER: What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
PETER: It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
DRIVER: Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
PETER: Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
DRIVER: Oh, yeah?
PETER: Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
DRIVER: Oh, yeah?
PETER: You win!
