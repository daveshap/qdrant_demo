Are there precedents for threatening to expel a Senate candidate?
The National Republican Senatorial Committee's spokesperson has just posted  this statement on Roy Moore

> “I believe the individuals speaking out against Roy Moore spoke with courage and truth, proving he is unfit to serve in the United States Senate and he should not run for office. If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate.”

Meanwhile, the Senate Majority Leader [McConnell has asked Moore to step down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mcconnell-calls-on-roy-moore-to-end-senate-campaign-following-accusations-of-sexual-misconduct/2017/11/13/1ca48d56-c890-11e7-aa96-54417592cf72_story.html) and a dozen other Senators have done the same. Is there any precedent where a Senate candidate or a Senator has been expelled or has been threatened with expulsion?
