JENNIFER: Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
PETER: Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
FRIDA: Yes... I... we had dinner.
LLOYD: Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
FRIDA: No, it was our first date.
LLOYD: Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
PETER: When's the last time you saw him?
FRIDA: We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
LLOYD: A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
FRIDA: No, I said it was our first date.
JENNIFER: How the hell is that your business?
PETER: We're just trying to figure out what happened.
FRIDA: I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
PETER: Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
