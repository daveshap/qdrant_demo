Survive the summer without AC
For us in the Northern Hemisphere, summer is coming (or here) and shit's üî•, yo. Seriously, like things are or will soon be on fire in my neck of the woods ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Anyway living without any or proper AC sucks. I happened upon something really helpful yesterday and thought I'd share.

* Box fan: $20 at Home Depot/Walmart/etc.
* [Large, longlasting ice pack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QFZL1Q/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_jfOaDb3Z3EFEQ): $15 (use an HSA [in US] if you have one)
* Optional: Cold washcloth around your neck

I put the ice pack (in its cloth cover down my back. With the box fan on and the washcloth things were downright bearable. It was roughly 85 degrees F in my house.

Stay cool out there, friends.
