How to cope with slow work
I work a job where the work really comes in waves. I have days where I can hardly keep up with the necessities, and days where I’m sitting around doing nothing for hours. I discussed with multiple coworkers and managers and they said more or less, that’s how it is here. We’re allowed to create our own schedule as long as we’re responsive in a reasonable amount of time. No one is concerned if you’re not working as long as you keep up with your responsibilities. I just feel so guilty during the down time that I’m not working during work hours. The pay is good, I enjoy the job, the atmosphere is wonderful, but the guilt of doing non-work things during work hours is hard to get used to. I know I should see it as balancing out for the times I’m working late and overwhelmed but it’s hard for me. I’ve always had jobs that expected me to work nonstop, so the flexibility and variability is hard to get used to. I’m not complaining, but need to find a way to see it where I don’t feel so darn guilty. I always feel like I’m being lazy and going to get in trouble for not working, even though it’s just the way it is.

Any words of advice on handling the guilt? Helpful hints on ways to restructure my mind into getting used to it? Any relatable stories?
