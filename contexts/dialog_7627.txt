DR. THURMAN: And they grow out of our stomachs?
DONNIE: It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us. I followed my spear... and I found something...
DR. THURMAN: What did you find?
DONNIE: Nothing.
DR. THURMAN: Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
DONNIE: Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
DR. THURMAN: Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
DONNIE: You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn, Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
