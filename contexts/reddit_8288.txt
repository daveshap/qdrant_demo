Is Robert Mueller legally barred from commenting on the removal of Sessions as AG or addressing any impact it has on his investigation?
Maybe this is silly, but I actually can't find a statement from Robert Mueller showing that he concerned with the removal of Sessions and the implications that Whitaker taking over will hamper him. 

Frankly, I can't seem to find any quotes from Mueller at all about the the DOJ switch or him being obstructed or really anything about the investigation, with the exception of:

* the false claims statement: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/30/mueller-accuses-opponents-of-offering-money-to-make-false-claims-about-him.html

* His DOJ page with his appointment, expenditures, indictments, and subpoenas https://www.justice.gov/sco.

Everything else is from "anonymous sources" or "sources with knowledge of the situation". It doesn't appear he's said a word about the DOJ change. Politicians sound very concerned it will hamper him. Journalists and citizens too.

Is Mueller legally barred from making any statements about the investigation or DOJ change, such that he could *not* voice concern if he felt his team was being obstructed or hampered? 

Is there a law or statute governing the position of Special Council that makes it such that he cannot address this?
