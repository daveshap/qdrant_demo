JEANNE: Get them out of here!
CHARLES: Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
JEANNE: Why did you betray me? Paris was ours for the taking! All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
CHARLES: Gave you? Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
JEANNE: So how would you put it?
CHARLES: Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done. Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English. You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, to everything there is a season: a time for war
JEANNE: Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
CHARLES: Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty? Do you enjoy it? All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
