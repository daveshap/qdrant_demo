MRS. DICKSON: What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
CLUETT: Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
MRS. DICKSON: Me?
CLUETT: Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
MRS. DICKSON: For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
CLUETT: Well, you can. You always could.
MRS. DICKSON: Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
MRS. DICKSON: Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
CLUETT: What is?
MRS. DICKSON: —running around. Not your work. You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
CLUETT: If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
MRS. DICKSON: Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
CLUETT: Line?
MRS. DICKSON: Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
MRS. DICKSON: Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
CLUETT: But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
MRS. DICKSON: Now let me see, what comes next? Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
