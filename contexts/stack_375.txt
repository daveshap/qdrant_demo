Safari stops working when attached to a corporate network My work MBP is in a corporate network which has heavy security. For the last few months Safari has been driving me crazy. It will work for a period of time, then just stop. No matter what web page I ask for (Public like Google or StackOverFlow, or the companies own confluence or other servers) the blue progress bar goes to around 10-15% then just stops. The web page never loads, never times out. Just nothing. Chrome doesn't have the same problems. But I'd rather use Safari. I'm guessing this could be an issue with the corporate proxies, but I don't know how to debug it. Sometimes restarting Safari gets it working again for a while, sometimes I have to restart the machine to get it back. Am on Mojave.Any advice? Corporate IT has no idea even though there's hundreds of Macbooks in here now.
