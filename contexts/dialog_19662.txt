LEON: But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
NINOTCHKA: I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
GASTON: Good morning, Your Highness.
SWANA: Good morning, Gaston.
GASTON: Count d'Algout is still asleep.
SWANA: That's all right.
SWANA: Leon! What in heaven's name...!
LEON: Huh?
SWANA: Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
LEON: No.
SWANA: Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
LEON: I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
SWANA: Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much. You look so pale... pale but interesting.
