How to go about cold calling/emailing for a job or internship
So I work at Starbucks and noticed a customer had a delta airlines pin on and we started talking about aviation and she told me that she is a 35 year employee at delta airlines and how she loves the company and then she asked me about my career goals and i told her i finish up my degree this fall and passed my written FAA exam and take my practical in 3 months. Then i started talking to her husband who recently retired from Delta but now works at the local airport in operations. He told me i should reach out to xxx about internships or job opportunities at the airport and say that xxx talked to me and gave me his contact info. How do i go about emailing him?
