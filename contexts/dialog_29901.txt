TRUMAN: Josie, I think we should go public.
JOSIE: That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
TRUMAN: What are you afraid of? What people think?
JOSIE: I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
TRUMAN: Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
JOSIE: Fish eyes?
TRUMAN: Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
JOSIE: Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
TRUMAN: I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.
TRUMAN: I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
JOSIE: I understand.
TRUMAN: We throw away the whole head.
DONNA: I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
LAURA: No, you should forget about last night.
DONNA: Laura, I am your friend.
LAURA: I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
DONNA: You're not mad at me?
LAURA: No.
DONNA: I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long. They all knew you at that place.
LAURA: What can I tell you?
DONNA: How did the car get back here?
LAURA: WE got it back, that's all.
DONNA: How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
LAURA: I can't help you there.
DONNA: Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
LAURA: All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
DONNA: But I love you, Laura.
LAURA: And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
DONNA: Why do you do it, Laura?
LAURA: Cause I like it.
