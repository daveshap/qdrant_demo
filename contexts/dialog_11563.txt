MA: Anybody ask anything?
ROSASHARN: No'm.
MA: Stand by the door.
MA: How's it feel, Tommy?
TOM: Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?
MA: Looks like you done it.
TOM: I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
MA: Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
TOM: They killed Casy first.
MA: That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
TOM: They know what--this fella looks like?
MA: They know he got hit in the face.
TOM: I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
MA: It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
TOM: I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
MA: Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us. They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn-- --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
TOM: Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
