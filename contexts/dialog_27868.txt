DON CORLEONE: Have you thought about a wife? A family?
MICHAEL: No.
DON CORLEONE: I understand, Michael. But you must make a family, you know.
MICHAEL: I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
DON CORLEONE: Accept what's happened, Michael.
MICHAEL: I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice. From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
DON CORLEONE: No, I wanted other things for you.
MICHAEL: You wanted me to be your son.
DON CORLEONE: Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
MICHAEL: Then why have I become a man like you?
DON CORLEONE: You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men. I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over. That was my misfortune. That was your misfortune. I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was. I had no choice.
MICHAEL: A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
DON CORLEONE: What else do you believe in?
