GONZO: Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
DUKE: You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
GONZO: What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
DUKE: Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine.
GONZO: The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?
GONZO: Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
DUKE: And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
HITCHHIKER: Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
DUKE: Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
