Could some interpret this email I just received...did I just get rejected?
Okay so I applied for a position a few weeks ago and just now received an email from, according to her email signature, a secretary. The email said, “in regards to your application please see the attached letter from professor...” okay a little weird but I think this has happened once before, I was expecting a rejection letter. The professor was also CC.

So I open the letter and it says, “thank you for your submitting an application for....you will be contacted again only in the event of further interest in your credentials. Your interest is appreciated and we wish you well in your professional endeavors.”

So I’m confused. Yes, literally it means I will be contacted if they are interested, but why was it done like this? What could be the motive or purpose? Why one email basically leasing to another? Why this effort and not just say, “yes come in for an interview” or “no we are not interested?”

Or was this their way of rejecting me?

Any ideas?
