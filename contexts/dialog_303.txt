PRIEST: The Fifth Element...
KOMMANDER: Take them and put them in a safe place.
PRIEST: Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
KOMMANDER: When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
PRIEST: Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
KOMMANDER: Time is of no importance, only life is important.
KOMMANDER: When EVIL returns so shall we.
PRIEST: We will be ready, Lord.
