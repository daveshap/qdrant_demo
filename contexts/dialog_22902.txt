JACKSON: Me? I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon. I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
REIBEN: Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
JACKSON: I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here. Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
UPHAM: I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship. I've never been to Tahiti.
REIBEN: What about you, Captain?
MILLER: I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
JACKSON: Say what, Cap'n?
MILLER: You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley. It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field. The garage windows face left field. The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them. The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens. Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows. It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far. I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship. I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
JACKSON: Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
MILLER: It's worth it.
JACKSON: To each, his own.
