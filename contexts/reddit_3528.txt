Shout out to the friends
Hey all,

Just wanted to give a shout out to all our friends who support us as we try our hand at dating.

I had arranged for a second date with a girl tonight, all sorted out, both looking forward to it then she starts ghosting me.

Talking to a friend this afternoon saying that "Man I think I'm getting stood up tonight."

His immediate response, was "No your not, I will meet you at 8pm, and we will have the best bro date"

Just wanted to give him a shout out, the guy didn't skip a beat to support me and turn what would have been a pretty horrible night into a great one.

Edit:

So an update for you guys. We met at the indoor mini golf place we have drinks, we play, we actually meet some really nice couples playing golf in front of us and behind us.

We go to a pub after to keep the good vibes going. He let me talk out my disappointment, we discuss strategy so it doesn't happen again. Also had fantastic laughs thinking about "what if she actually turned up!"

But great night the search continues
