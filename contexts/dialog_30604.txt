BUD: ...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?

CHARLIE: ...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
BUD: ...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
BUD: I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
MARV: Yeah, where's your machine gun.
BUD: Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
MARV: Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down. Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
BUD: Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.

MANNHEIM: Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world.
