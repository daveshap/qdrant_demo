It took me two trips to grocery stores and driving around for thirty minutes, but I finally got myself to go in and get food. I wish this wasn't something people would tell me to be proud of for trying and succeeding. This is my life
No hate to people that do feel pride in getting over this. I do feel like you should. I just wish I wasn't in this situation
