Pharmacist as a career option
I am a current sophomore in high school as of right now, & lately i’ve been thinking about what i aspire to become within the future. The field of medicine has always seemed interesting to me & i think becoming a pharmacist would be a good fit. The thing with me is i really don’t want to spend too much time in school, i really want to make money as soon as possible. I’m not too knowledgeable about everything pertaining to Pre-Pharm & Pharm. D. programs & i was hoping someone on here could be able to help me out. I would just like to know if I can work as something such as a Pharmacy Tech. while still studying to become a pharmacist or anything like that of the sorts. I’m seeking a not-so time consuming pathway that will enable me to make an income as soon as possible. Thanks again &amp; i hope someone is able to help me with my questions & concerns :)
(Additionally, i’ve also has interest in Biomedical Engineering. If anyone can help me with answers pertaining to salary, hours, stress levels, etc. with this career path, I would appreciate it greatly :))
