EM: It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
ALEX: Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
EM: You've not been to school all week, son.
ALEX: I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
EM: Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
ALEX: Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
