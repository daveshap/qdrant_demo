Is it possible to detect if a trojan or program sends information by sniffing the network of a VM Explaining better, I was consulting on how I can ensure that the programs of an operating system does not perform any suspicious activity with my information, and I have been told that electronic devices come to monitor the network and know what happens in it.Thinking of an alternative, it occurred to me that I could clone the current system and run it in virtualbox and sniff the network traffic of the virtual machine.Could this be as effective as the electronic device for detecting backdoors or programs that can send our information?<blockquote>  Please consider editing my question if it is poorly written in your language because I am native Spanish.
