What did the Fairy Godmother do to Doris? In Shrek 2, just before Shrek interrupts the Fairy Godmother (Dama Fortuna) making Love Potion No. 9 for Fiona, you can see 2 pictures of Doris the stepsister from earlier at the Poison Apple, one saying \"Before\" and one saying \"After\". The \"Before\" one is of her looking like a man and the \"After\" one is of her looking like a woman. But earlier in the film, Doris still looks like a male. So did The Fairy Godmother screw her over or something?
