BARTENDER: Mornin', Doc...
DOC WILSON: You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
DOUG: Kiss my ass.
DOC WILSON: Well.
BARTENDER: He had a hard day. Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
DOC WILSON: Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
BARTENDER: Big day last night.
DOC WILSON: Hope to tell you. Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
