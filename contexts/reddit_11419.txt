People who call you greedy, when truly its them being greedy
Just felt like I needed to get this on here.

All my life I have been careful about money. This has led me into situations where Ive been called greedy. I have never avoided paying anything ive shared with people. I have never avoided my responsibilites when it comes to money.

I was the only one who had a car in high school, and people expected to catch a ride with me for free. I told this one dude once, he could pay me about 25bucks per month and I could get him back and forth to school every day (20minute drive to school, 20min back, so 40mins). He refused. He also called me petty for asking this.

Then there was this time I hesitantly drove a few "friends" to a party not to far away. Apparently in the middle of the night, they call me and say I have to pick them up, and that was to be expected when I drove them to the place. I said that we didnt agree on that, and they hung up on me, and all of them screaming greedy fucker in the background.

And the last story was some one who wanted to hike along, saying they needed to go down the road to their house or something. I told them no, I dont do free stuff. Pay me and perhaps it will be ok. They then proceed to call me greedy, even though its them who wants something for free, isnt it them being greedy?

All the people in the stories are different people. Are people really like this all around?
