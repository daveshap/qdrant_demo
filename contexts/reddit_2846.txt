Would I be stupid to leave my first job out of college after only two months?
Basically the company that hired me misled me about every aspect of this job. I was sent to a town (population 400) in the middle of nowhere. A few locations were mentioned during the interview process. This town was never mentioned and isn’t remotely close to any of the places that were mentioned. The offer letter I received had a different location listed on it as well. I was told I’d be receiving paid trips home and per diem. Just before arriving here I was told that employees with my title would not receive per diem or paid trips home.

I work 13 hours a day and I have to work 18 days straight to get 3 days off. I receive no overtime pay or per diem. The 3 days off are intended to be a chance to go home, but much of that time is spent traveling since I’m in the middle of nowhere, and I have to spend hundreds of dollars out of pocket to even leave to go home. The closest grocery store is an hour away, and I do t have days off to even go there. I have to go right after work and it’s a 3 hour ordeal. I have to spend an entire night just to get groceries. I’m not getting enough sleep and I don’t have enough time to eat. 

I don’t see how these conditions are sustainable for the next year. Would I be stupid to leave this situation after only two months here? It just doesn’t make sense to me. I could find another job without too much difficulty that pays approximately the same salary for half the work hours in a much better location. What should I do?

Edit: I’m a field engineer. Commercial construction. Hours are typically long, but not like this. I have many friends who work half the hours as me and are paid just as much. Also I have a degree in civil engineering, so there are multiple career paths I could decide to pursue.
