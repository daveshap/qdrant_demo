KAY: Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
LEONARD: They're not my pals--
KAY: They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
LEONARD: What if I don't?
KAY: In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
LEONARD: Will it lower the curve?
KAY: I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make. Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
LEONARD: I wanna make a deal.
