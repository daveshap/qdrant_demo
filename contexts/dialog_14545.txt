HENDRICKS: Chief....
BRODY: Hendricks. I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
HENDRICKS: I never heard of a 908.
BRODY: I just made it up. It means, Get me out of there." What the hell's that?"
HENDRICKS: Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
BRODY: Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that.
HENDRICKS: Rich people. Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
BRODY: If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
HENDRICKS: If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
