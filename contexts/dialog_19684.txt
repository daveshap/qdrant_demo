NINOTCHKA: Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
LEON: A funny story?
NINOTCHKA: You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
LEON: Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
NINOTCHKA: Go on.
LEON: No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one. The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
NINOTCHKA: Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
LEON: You must, darling.
NINOTCHKA: To the loveliest story I ever heard.
