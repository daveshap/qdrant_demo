Phone interview two weeks ago; said they’d call in a week, didn’t call me so I called and left a voicemail. Still haven’t heard back. Should I suspect I didn’t get it?
Two weeks ago (a Wednesday) I had my second phone interview for a company. At the end of the interview they said they’d call next Wednesday. 

So I stayed glued to my phone all day when Wednesday rolled around and didn’t hear anything from them. 

I ended up waiting until Friday to call for an update about the candidacy but received the voicemail box so I left a message. 

It’s now coming up on a week after they said they’d call me. Should I suspect that I didn’t get the position or should I be patient?
