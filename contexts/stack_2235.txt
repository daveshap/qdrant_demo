Why did I become a vampire after I rejected the 'offer'? I recently started the dawnguard quests and after completing the first quest, we get to choose sides. Be or not to be a vampire, right? I gladly rejected the 'offer' and continued to ply quests for dawnguard. The second quest for them was to recruit 2 of their old pals. Before stating the mission I went to riften for selling stuffs and train but all of a sudden I m a vampire. Message popped up saying that my vampire blood boils in sun. Here's what I did exactly. I went to riften and since I had fast travelled it was nighttime so I used the wait feature for 10 hrs. Then this all happened.I even loaded the last save and did all over again but even then the message saying 'Your Vampire blood awakens'. Is this a bug or is it because I was harmed by vampires during battle??
