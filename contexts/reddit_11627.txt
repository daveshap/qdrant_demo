College Admissions.
I learned that got rejected from a school I applied early decision to this afternoon. It has around a 6% overall acceptance rate, so I was never terribly optimistic in the first place, but I really fell into the delusion that they would accept me. I'm honestly not upset about the decision itself, but rather I'm a bit angry with myself about how I'm at peace with this. The reality is that with this rejection I need to take the next two or three weeks to write the remainder of my college applications and do well on my finals, but it's just not sinking in quite yet. I know I need to finish this semester strong, but it's honestly hard, especially when I counted on my acceptance as almost insurance for the remainder of the year. I don't need to hear that I'm still a strong student, because I am proud of my standardized testing and the culmination of my four years of high school but I'm a bit at a loss for words right now. Life feels like it's is at a standstill, or at least that's what I want it to be. I don't really know what I'm trying to express here, but I just want to get it off my chest. Maybe I'll write something more coherent another day.
