How to prevent CP 3000+ pokemons from losing motivation unreasonably quickly? It seems like Pokemon above CP 3000 lose motivation much more quickly than pokemon below CP 3000. Is there any way to prevent this?As of now, most my defenders will just decay of their own very quickly, even when not attacked, and this is super frustrating.Is this difference in rate of motivation decay a bug? Or is it documented somewhere with descriptions of how to mitigate it?
