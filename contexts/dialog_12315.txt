VERONICA: It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
J.D.: You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
VERONICA: How do you turn the fucker off?
J.D.: You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
VERONICA: The bomb, asshole!
J.D.: Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
VERONICA: You know what I want, babe?
J.D.: What?
