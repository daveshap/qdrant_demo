How do u overcome self hate?
I have almost no interest in living In almost 16 and I feel like a loser. I can’t even be around people my age. I’ve been treated really bad by class mates since the 3rd grade. I was a really happy kid. I feel like a complete disappointment. I don’t have talents. I’m probably the most average person. I haven’t been to school in 2 months I went to a psychiatric hospital. I feel so alone. I’m more scared of life than I am of death. I feel so worth less
