GRADY: You're fucked in the head.
JESSE: I'm scared, Grady. I know it sounds crazy. But, there's something trying to get into my body.
GRADY: The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor. And you want to sleep with me. Go figure.
JESSE: Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
GRADY: I believe you. You had some scary dreams, okay?
JESSE: No! I don't know - everything's all mixed up. What difference does it make? I'm in trouble here. I need your help.
GRADY: Okay, schmuck. What do you want me to do?
JESSE: Just watch me. If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
