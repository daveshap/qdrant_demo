ATHOS: Porthos sleeps, and you plot. Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
ARAMIS: Soon enough. Here we are.
ATHOS: The Prison of Belle Sur.
ARAMIS: Come, we have a boat waiting.
ATHOS: What is that?
ARAMIS: A body.
ATHOS: I see that is a body! But where did you get it?
PORTHOS: He gets one day of confession each year. Today is the day.
ATHOS: Who does?
PORTHOS: Best not to ask. Shouldn't even talk about it.
ATHOS: What do we do now?
PORTHOS: I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
