Does this sound like a scam?
Today an 07 number contacted me about a customer service position that I don't remember applying to, saying that tomorrow I have a Zoom appointment with the managing director. The exact wording they use is "Open Day Zoom Appointment". I've applied to similar positions, but I can't find a confirmation email of my application, and the website looked completely foreign to me. The website didn't even show vacancies or really specify what they do, its just an outsource company.

Is there a way attending this Zoom appointment could be harmful to me in any way, or is it just a waste of my time if it is not genuinely a job I applied for but forgot about.
