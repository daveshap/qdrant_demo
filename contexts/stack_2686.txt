Multidimensional File to allow for pixel values across time series I have a composite of SAR (28 images in a time series) data and I am trying to get the values of each pixel for the whole time series. I am looking at the coefficient of variation and trying to display pixel values as the time series progresses. I was able to get the coefficient of variation from the time series but it only shows me a static value. I was reading that possibly using multidimensional files would allow me to slice the data and drill down the pixels across the time series. Can anyone give me any guidance?
