Information needed on recruiting services and how they can help a recent graduate land a job!
I just graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Finance in December and I have been applying to Financial Analyst positions posted on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc. I have no experience in Finance other than my academic projects. I responded to a post on LinkedIn last night for a Financial Analyst position and the man that I emailed my resume and cover letter to called me today. He works for Parker and Lynch which is a recruitment service. He made it sound like the position I applied for was not for me (a person fresh out of college with no related work experience) but we did set up an interview anyway so that he could potentially find me a position.

Is a recruiting service the way to go for someone in my position? I'm concerned that it'll basically be a temp agency where they'll match me with clerical work that pays hourly when what I'm after is a career with growth potential. I am also concerned that this service will cost money and, as someone fresh out of college, money is in short supply but I have no problem investing in my future if the opportunities they can offer me are worth it.

I'm unsure about how recruiting services work for the job seeker so any information is helpful. Thank you.
