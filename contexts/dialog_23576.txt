GEORGE: She's got a...
FELICIA: Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
GEORGE: Yeah, I think so.
FELICIA: That's very serious. Who's her doctor?

FELICIA: Gee, that's very serious...
GEORGE: I know.
FELICIA: Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
GEORGE: She did?
FELICIA: It turned out to be cancer.
GEORGE: Wow.
FELICIA: So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
GEORGE: I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
GEORGE: And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
FELICIA: You're very rude... if you don't come back --
GEORGE: I'll be back in a while.
FELICIA: I don't want to see you anymore.
GEORGE: I'll be right back, baby, really.
