ADAM: Marco!
RYAN: What are you doing?
ADAM: I'm not cheating! I'm not looking!
ROBIN: What are you doing?
GEORGE: He doesn't answer.
ROBIN: He never answers.
GEORGE: Why does he have a lock on his door?
ROBIN: Because he put the lock on! Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!? I don't know anything, anymore!
