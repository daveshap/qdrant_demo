NORMAN: Claire, please don't...
CLAIRE: What did you think I would do? Jesus Christ! I gave up my life and my music...
NORMAN: I never asked you to quit!
CLAIRE: ...Oh BULLSHIT. You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
NORMAN: THAT'S NOT TRUE! You wanted to quit! And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
CLAIRE: Who?
NORMAN: To Caitlin!!
CLAIRE: Leave her out of this!
NORMAN: And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
CLAIRE: Stop...
NORMAN: ...would do anything just to be around me. And I slipped. God help me, I slipped.
CLAIRE: I'm not going to listen to this.
NORMAN: I tried to break it off!
CLAIRE: You should have tried harder.
NORMAN: Claire...
CLAIRE: Get out of my way.
