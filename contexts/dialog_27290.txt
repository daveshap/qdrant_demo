MIRIAM: You're sure? Any more nightmares?
CATHERINE: No.
MIRIAM: Good. We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
CATHERINE: Yes mother.
MIRIAM: I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time. Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
MIRIAM: Don't bring it home in this.
CATHERINE: Okay.
MIRIAM: Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about. Want to come?
CATHERINE: I've got to feed my cat. Besides, I want to get to bed early.
MIRIAM: That's my girl.
