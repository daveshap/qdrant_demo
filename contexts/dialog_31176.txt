CASSANDRA: Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
JIM: Your guests, ma'am?
CASSANDRA: Yes, in a way. I'm the Doctor's social secretary. I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
CASSANDRA: Oh, don't worry. I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
JIM: Well, I owe you one, don't I?
CASSANDRA: You most certainly do.
