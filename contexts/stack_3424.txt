Where is the public key of the Certificate authority stored? I'm talking about SSL/TLS certificate authorities. I know that they store their private key on a very secure location. but what about their public key that our browsers use to make sure the signatures are actually signed by the certificate authority we are talking about, where is that public key stored?Is it possible to edit these public keys thus by having physical access to someone's web browser/computer can an attacker change those public keys to their own public keys and render the CA on that particular computer/web browser useless?
