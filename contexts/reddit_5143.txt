I’ve been volunteering with the same non-profit for 3 years, when I finally apply for a paid position I’m rejected. Do I keep volunteering?
I’ve been helping out at a non-profit in my community since 2016. It’s primarily a women’s shelter but they also offer other services to the community including a girls day camp in the summer. I have helped sort and organize clothing donations, hosted an art club for residents, helped set up their annual Women’s Award Luncheon, and even helped residents with the job search. 

Last summer I also volunteered at the girls day camp. I had a lot of fun and the two women supervising me said I was an incredible help. So this year when the camp coach position opened up I jumped at it.

I interviewed with the hiring executive for the camp and I thought it went quite well. Today I received an email saying essentially this:

“Thank you for all you’ve done for the organization. Thank you for your interest in the paid position. When are you available to volunteer again?”

Now I’m starting to question if I should keep doing free work for the organization I love and believe in when I really need a paid position and I’d like to join their ranks as an actual employee.

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone for their feedback. This afternoon I contacted the camp directors requesting feedback on my resume and interview. Camp starts next week...we’ll see what they say. If they never respond I’ve decided I’ll only lead three yoga classes because I already offered to do this but no more daily volunteering.

FINAL UPDATE: I received a form denial letter via email after inquiring about improvements I could make in order to occupy the role in the future.
