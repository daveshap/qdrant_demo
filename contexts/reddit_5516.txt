Biochemistry and nothing but serving experience, what career to start?
Posting on behalf of someone else, but she has a biochemistry degree and after graduated continued to be a server for 3 years.

I am assuming this does not look good from an employers stand point and more importantly I’m not sure if serving experience counts as much real life experience? I’m not bashing it I personally thing everyone should have to work in hospitality/retail for a year to build character and learn how to treat people. It’d make the world a better place...

Those who started making serving as a career and then got out, what did you get into?
