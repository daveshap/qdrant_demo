EVIL SCIENTIST: You're mine, you know. I made you.
SALLY: I know.
EVIL SCIENTIST: If you went away, what would become of me?
SALLY: I'm grown up now. I have to leave some time.
EVIL SCIENTIST: Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
SALLY: I can't help it.
EVIL SCIENTIST: That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off. People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
EVIL SCIENTIST: I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
SALLY: I know.
EVIL SCIENTIST: But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
SALLY: That's not true. It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
EVIL SCIENTIST: Just what?
SALLY: Just me, I suppose... I'm restless. I can't help it.
