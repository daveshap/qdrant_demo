How to get better IAM understanding I'm getting interested in Identity and Access Management (IAM), but I find it hard to find complete and understandable explanations that suit me, surely because I started wrong.I began with Wikipedia and followed discussions here and there (twitter, slack channels, etc.).My main problems are :Terminology : sometimes, explanations need explanation about the words usedDifferent schools of thought : often, there are different ways of interpreting the problems and then even more ways of addressing them. I don't understand what methods are best for what situtation, and I want to know why this or that is not as good as another. I see divergent opinions and rarely people set for a best solution or method.Technologies : I've read somewhere that a good access control works in synergy with the filesystem, that should be suited for that purpose. Is that true ? What are these systems ?References : I fantasise to find a one, \"best\" reference that would clear all that up, while being objective and addressing things I have forgotten or didn't know.For example, I started to think that ABAC would give the best fine-grained control and that XACML, SAML and OAUTH2 used together to form a perfect (yet maybe heavy and complex) system. But then I saw people ranting about it (\"yet another OASIS definition\") and opposing it to NGAC (Next Generation Access Control).So now my questions:How should I operate to gain the right expertise on that subject? In other words: where to start, what to look up next, what to ultimately achieve doing?Am I asking the right questions?
