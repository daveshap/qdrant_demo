JONES: I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
GOOF: He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
JONES: [Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
GOOF: Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
JONES: Thousands?
GOOF: Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
JONES: What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
GOOF: Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
JONES: Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
GOOF: That's it. You get it quick.
JONES: But where do the rats come in?
GOOF: You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
