MULDER: It's like jelly.
SCULLY: There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
SCULLY: And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
MULDER: You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
SCULLY: I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
SCULLY: You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
MULDER: I'd been told as much.
SCULLY: You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
MULDER: I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
SCULLY: Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here. I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
MULDER: We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
