People say this feeling is temporary and it will pass, but I have never experienced sustained happiness. I have always been depressed - my entire life.
It frustrates me that people think they have the right to morally press me into staying away from suicidal thought and faking enjoyment for life.

I will not kill myself, because of the natural human fear of death. That doesn’t mean I’m happy to be here or that I ever have been. 23 years of being depressed angry and fucked up and no it isn’t ever going to get any better I fucking know it won’t. I don’t even want to live a happy lie.

I fucking hate my selfish pathetic parents for putting me on this earth. I did not ask to participate in life. I did not consent to be effectively forced into wage slavery and then eventually the terrifying experience of death.

Off to get drunk now to blunt the sharpness of these feelings

EDIT: Getting drunk was 10000% the right decision I actually feel vaguely happy wtf is this magic
