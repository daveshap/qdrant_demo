Engineering / tech jobs that sponsor in the US
Hope everyone is staying safe! This is a very uncertain time for everyone, and as an international student searching for jobs, the future looks more bleak than ever. It would be awesome if we can help each other out during these rough times. If you have interned at / work at a company (for engineering or tech roles) that sponsors for sure, please reply to this post!

I know websites like myvisajobs exist, but I'd love to have advice from people with personal experience! Any help would go a long way :))
