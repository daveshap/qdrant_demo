Wanting something that'll never happen.
So there's this girl I talk to sometimes and whenever I do it seems like for just that split moment of me talking to her my troubles and pain goes away. I really wish I could tell her this and everything but between the significant age gap and the fact she's dating someone right now I know it'll destroy any friendship we have. I know I have to let it be but being single for so long I just want someone like her that can do what she does. I feel crazy for thinking about this so much but I don't know what else to do besides just not think about it.
