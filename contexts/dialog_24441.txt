NELS: Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
MORAN: Two D-6's. That's the kind his well was fitted for.
NELS: No spare.
MORAN: No.
NELS: So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
MORAN: Apparently.
NELS: I'm curious. The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
MORAN: I believe so.
NELS: Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
NELS: Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
MORAN: I don't think so.
NELS: You don't. <u>Think</u> so.
MORAN: He was heavy, but we were real careful. But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
NELS: You don't. <u>Remember</u>.
NELS: Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>. Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
MORAN: Possible. But not darn likely.
HOOKS: ...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
WHALEY: He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?' And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
HOOKS: Did you say more?
WHALEY: I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person. With a bloody gun- butt. A right-handed fella, to be precise.
HOOKS: And why. Is that?
WHALEY: Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war. I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times. Looked exactly like this one.
HOOKS: Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
WHALEY: Japanese stick-fighting. They're trained as kids, y'know. To kill with sticks.
