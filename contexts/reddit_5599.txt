Why is Software so hard to break into?
I have 10 years of tech marketing experience related to hardware. Every time I have applied for a software related job, even in marketing, I am told that software is way too different from hardware for my skills to be transferable. I am familiar with R and Python, and have been an application administrator in a previous role. What qualifies someone to actually be a good fit for a software related job?
