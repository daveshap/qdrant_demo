MALLOY: No... it can't end like that...
LOUIS: But it has. There is no more to tell.
MALLOY: But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
LOUIS: It's over, I'm telling you...
MALLOY: You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
