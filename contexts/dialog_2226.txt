WENDOVER: Nothing we can do, now.
KENT: Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...

KENT: It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
WENDOVER: What about time...?
SIR IAN: Cyclops will have to linger at the Pole to recharge his power banks.
WENDOVER: All right - go to it.
