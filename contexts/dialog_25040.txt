MAROTTA: You were the last one to see Thorkel. In Octavius' hospital room.
ROZ: So you've found Thorkel?
MAROTTA: Some of himâ€¦ char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide. Any bad blood between him and Ock?
ROZ: Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
MAROTTA: But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
ROZ: Waldos.
MAROTTA: Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
ROZ: Lieutenant, I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from-- Here. The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
MAROTTA: Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
ROZ: There's an infinitely greater danger. If-- Listen. The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment. To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
MAROTTA: Toxic dumps, huh.
ROZ: And he'll need a cyclotron. He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it. Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard. New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
MAROTTA: You sure about all this?
ROZ: I know him.
