JACK: Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
MILES: I can't help the traffic.
JACK: Come on. You're fucking hungover.
MILES: Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
MILES: Why did you tell them my book was being published?
JACK: You said you had it all lined up.
MILES: No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
JACK: Yeah, Conundrum.
MILES: ...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
JACK: I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
MILES: It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
