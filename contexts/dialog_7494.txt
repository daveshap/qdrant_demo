POWELL: What's going on?
ROBINSON: What's it look like? We're going in.
POWELL: Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
ROBINSON: -- all we know? We don't know shit, Powell. If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom? If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands? All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
POWELL: What about the body that fell out of the window -- ?
ROBINSON: Who the hell knows? Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement!
