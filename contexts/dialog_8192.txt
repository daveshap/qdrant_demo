DEAN: He didn't <u>give</u> me--
PRATT: --otherwise we may have to--
DEAN: Otherwise you may have to what?
PRATT: We'd rather not--

HICKS: He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
REYNOLDS: Hiding something?
HICKS: It was in his bag. Now it's not.
REYNOLDS: Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
JERRY: Can I talk to you a second?
DEAN: Table 122?
JERRY: That's what I want to talk to you about?
DEAN: I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
JERRY: The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
DEAN: An investigation? It was a bus accident.
JERRY: He's heard that it's escalated.
DEAN: Into what?
JERRY: Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
DEAN: I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
JERRY: Just be cool.
STACY: I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
DEAN: Well, you know--
STACY: He's got his priorities?
DEAN: There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
