BOBBY: Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
GRACE: I guess it must.
BOBBY: What do you do anyway?
GRACE: A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
BOBBY: Where'd you learn to do that?
GRACE: From my father. He was the tribe's shaman.
BOBBY: A medicine man?
GRACE: Those are white words, not ours.
BOBBY: Nice house for a shaman's daughter. You must be good.
GRACE: Come here.
