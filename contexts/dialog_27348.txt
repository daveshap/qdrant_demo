STARKS: But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
LORENSON: I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.

LORENSON: How do you know about Dr. Becker?
STARKS: My dad wrote some things down before he died.
