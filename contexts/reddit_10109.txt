What makes a complete bulletin board/program proposal? (x-post from /r/ResLife)
Hey everyone!
I am trying to put a resource together for my RAs as to what makes a bulletin board or program proposal "complete."
We've noticed some of these not quiet being up to snuff, but aren't quite sure how to describe what we are looking for without making it a checklist that will just seem onerous or leave RAs without an understanding of what we are trying to get at.
Any help would be much appreciated!
