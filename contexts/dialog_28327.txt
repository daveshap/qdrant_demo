HEALY: You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
MARY: Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
HEALY: Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
MARY: You're a movie buff?
HEALY: Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
MARY: Have you seen it?
HEALY: No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
MARY: A fucking moron.
HEALY: Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
MARY: Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
HEALY: Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
MARY: Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
HEALY: -- Love story of our time.
MARY: Yeah.
HEALY: Wow. I thought I was the only one.
MARY: So...
HEALY: Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
MARY: I guess.
HEALY: Well, I'll see ya.
HEALY: Mary ah, forget it.
MARY: What?
HEALY: No, forget it, it was stupid.
MARY: Come on, what were you going to say?
HEALY: Nah, really, it was moronic.
