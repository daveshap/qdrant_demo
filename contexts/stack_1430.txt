bidirectional buck/boost converter vs separate buck and boost converters I have recently leared about bidirectional buck/boost converters. They can be used in hybrid vehicles for optionally charging a 12v battery from a higher voltage battery or vice versa. How would one of these perform differently than separate buck and boost circuits with switches to determine which one is active at any given time?
