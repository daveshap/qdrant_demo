How can we measure relative velocity of fast objects when there is time dilation First of all sorry about the question title. I find it very difficult to ask this in less than 150 characters. I am not a physicist and only have basic understanding of advanced physical concepts.So here is the detailed question:Scenario:There are two people. PA and PB.A and B stands in some point in space in close proximity with 0 accelaration (constant velocity)PB starts to accelerate away from PA in a spaceship and reaches very high velocity (eventually reaches 0.5c)Assumptions: (please correct if these are wrong)PA measures that PB is travelling at 0.5cPA finds that PB's clock is moving slower than his (and vice-versa)PA finds that objects in PB's ship are moving in slow motionQuestion:If PA finds that PB, his ship and everything else in it moving slower(relative to PA's own clock), how come PA is still able to measure PB's velocity as 0.5c using PA's clock? Shouldn't every atom in PB and his ship feel like moving slower to PA?Does lorentz contraction play any part in this?
