Any one know of summer internships?
Hi friends! I am graduate student in Student Affairs and I am searching for a summer internship. I am really open geographically and functional area-wise. I am planning on going through the traditional NODA and ACUHOI-I routes, but was wondering if you know of anything that is unaffiliated with these organizations?
