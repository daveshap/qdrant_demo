PRUDHOE: What are you drinking?
JULIA: Just soda.
PRUDHOE: Plain soda?
JULIA: Please.
PRUDHOE: I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh? One soda, one whisky. I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
JULIA: That depends.
PRUDHOE: Oh?
PRUDHOE: You know it's not often I... you know...
JULIA: There's a first time for everything.
PRUDHOE: I suppose that's right.
JULIA: You want something to drink?
PRUDHOE: I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
