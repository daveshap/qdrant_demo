ERIN: Yeah. I'm probably ruining them.
GEORGE: How?
ERIN: I'm never here. I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
GEORGE: I was serious before, you know. If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
ERIN: Great. Another deadbeat.
GEORGE: I'm not a deadbeat. I work when I need to.
ERIN: Yeah? And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
GEORGE: I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
ERIN: I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
GEORGE: Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
ERIN: It's been a while. Maybe I'm just out of practice.
GEORGE: Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
ERIN: Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
GEORGE: Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with them.
ERIN: Right.
