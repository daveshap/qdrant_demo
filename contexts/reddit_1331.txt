Is anyone else Physically unable to relax the day of something scheduled?
For example: Let's say I have this appointment next Tuesday, at 4pm. Up until that day, it's not too bad. I know it's not THAT day yet, so I'm able to relax a little bit. "Oh, I don't have to do that thing for a another few days, thank god" but then slowly the day of starts rolling around. The Day before I start getting this terrible grumpy attitude and mood, I start feeling depressed, my day is ruined because of this thing the next day.

I start losing sleep, I toss and turn at Night before this scheduled thing thinking and thinking about the worst thing ever happening tomorrow to me, when in actuality it never turns out to be that bad.

Then the Day of this thing rolls around, I wake up in an absolute foul mood, I set off 3 hours earlier than I probably should have just because I can't bear the thought of sitting in the house when I have this thing coming up (I psychically cannot relax, my body won't allow me). I've tried staying at home knowing I have some appointment later in the day, and I honestly feel like I'm trapped in a jail cell.

But then, after all of that, a huge sigh of relief just blows over me. This thing I've been worrying about wasn't even that bad, but the build-up is the real killer, the real anxiety builder and sometimes I honestly feel like I'm losing my sanity. I go from this grumpy, depressed guy to someone absolutely happy beyond belief at least for those few hours after getting something done.
