Java or Ubuntu Bug? (Problem with Minecraft) As a lefty I wanted to change my Minecraft keybindings for walking to p, l, \u00f6, \u00e4 so that I have the mouse in the left hand. Then I realized a bug: If I press \u00f6 or \u00e4 to walk to the right or backwards I just don't stop walking when I have stopped pressing the button. I figured out this does not happen on Windows 10 so it has to be a Ubuntu or at least Linux thing. After some testing I figured out that these are not the only buttons that have this problem, all these have this problem: \u00f6, \u00e4, \u00fc, #, +. I am not quite sure if this is a Java or an Ubuntu bug. What do you think? Do you have any idea how to find out the issue or how to fix it?keyboard: Razer Blackwiddow Chroma, German versionGerman keyboard configuration on Ubuntu (and also Windows where I tested if this is a bug concerning Minecraft)Ubuntu 16.04 LTSXeon E3 1231v3Gtx 1060 from PalitOpenJDK 1.8Minecraft Version 1.12 if that mattersFeel free to ask me if you need some more information.
