Displaying unpublished data analyses on Github
I’m not sure if this is the place to ask or if I am better asking stats people but it is related to any data analysis stuff you have done in grad school for your PI.

Well basically I’m in Biostats Masters and I have done a lot of stat analyses on bio/biochem datasets for people in my lab. 

These analyses are not simple t-tests or anything that trivial they are a lot of comprehensive Mixed Model GLMs/GAMs. I’d like to showcase some of this stuff for employers but I’m not sure if its ok. 

What is the way to go about this? Because the data is unpublished. The thing is if I can’t show this then I don’t have much to show on there.
