Has anyone benefited from online certification/training?
Im entering my senior year of undergrad and am nervously in the grad school search. I want to do everything I can do make myself marketable, and thought about those certifications you can get online. The one that interests me is Psychological first aid, which helps in connecting individuals to professionals that can help with mental illness. Im trying to think of what I can do to show programs/employers that Im making an effort to be more qualified. 

Be honest, from the perspective of an employer or grad program, is this something that is worth mentioning or putting in a resume?
