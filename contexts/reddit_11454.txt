I relapsed on pills after 3 months and realised i dont want anything in life anymore, i am only looking forward to movinf to colorado at 21 and getting wasted legally 24/7
Im 17 years old and relapsed thursday after three months of relative sobriety( i domt count acid as a problem drug nor weed, since they dont wreck my life like meth or pills do). I spent all of my junior year getting high as fuck, i dont get along with people who arent criminals/drug users, i cant NOT.be overly vulgar or obnoxiously loud, i have a horrible temper and get irrationally angry which leads to assaulting people, i cant control myself, i kinda always want to die, i dont mean it when i tell my girlfriend i love her but i used to mean it, i dont feel emotions anymore, i just feel numb and that kinda upsets me.
I always think of my ex. I yell at my gf so much and make her cry all the time, im a shitty person overall, im extremely charming/ manipulative when i need to be and completely lack the ability to be genuine, i havent picked up my guitar forever now, i cant focus on writing or reading more than a page, i have no attention span, and i am just really fucking bad.

I used to be an innocent boy, and i wish i could be again. But i feel mentally emotionally and physically scarred.
