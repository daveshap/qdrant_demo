CASTOR: You're the only person in this place who can see right through me.
LAZARRO: You've made us look pretty good in the past week. And the way you handled the press --
CASTOR: Just following your example.
LAZARRO: D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion. There's just one problem.
CASTOR: What's that?
LAZARRO: Me. I have doubts about your ability to stick with what is essentially a desk job.
CASTOR: I had doubts too. I always looked at a desk as though it were a ball-and-chain. But something happened ...
LAZARRO: You'd have to start immediately.
CASTOR: Done. In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
LAZARRO: Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me. Congratulations.
