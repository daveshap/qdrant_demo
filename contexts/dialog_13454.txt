FRANCIS: Arise and shine, young Hood.
PAUL: I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
FRANCIS: The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
FRANCIS: Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
PAUL: Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
FRANCIS: Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
PAUL: I gotta get to English class.
