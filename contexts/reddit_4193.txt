Wish me luck, ladies and gents.
Since my last relationship, I've been ghosted, catfished, stood up, and gaslighted. I haven't had a second date in almost six months, and I *finally* found somebody worth the second date. I've got a good feeling. 

Wish me luck though, because I **really** don't want to screw this up.

Edit for grammar and Update: It went well! She's going to stick around for a while. Thanks everybody for the well-wishes and good vibes, I wish it all back to you!
