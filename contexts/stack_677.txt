HOw do I Give VLANs internet access? The challenge that I am faced with is as follows.I need to give internet access to several VLANs via a single Ubuntu 16.04 router.The VLANs are 8021q tagged and arrive at the router on interface ens1f1.VLANs are named vlan10, vlan20, vlan30, and vlan40.The internet uplink is connected to enp0s25.Enp0s25 has a static public IP address assigned by the ISP.The upstream device connected to Enp0s25 is not VLAN capable.I ask you sage and wizened engineers or packet manglers out there if you would please explain to me how I can route, bridge, NAT, or catapult packets between those VLANs and that great tangle of plumbing we call the internet.In the meantime, I shall retreat to my cupboard muttering error 418 (RFC 2324).Regards,Kevin
