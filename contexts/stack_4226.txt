Would there be any need for a space battle? In space fantasy movies, you see huge space-battleships, like Star Wars. You have to think of stuff like that.These battleships:Fight at a close rangeMostly laser gunsHave smaller fighter spacecraftFight in orbit of planetsNow my questions are:Why would they fight like thisWhy would they fight in spaceHow would they evolve to fight like this.The big question is (as in the comments), Will space battles ever be like this?This might be a very broad question, i'm trying to phrase my question right.
