DELIA: Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>. Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door. Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
CHARLES: We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too. I saw a fly today.
BARBARA: Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
ADAM: Not really... what's this?
