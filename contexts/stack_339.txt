Can I access iCloud Drive files from non-apple device? I have an application that stores its files on iCloud Drive for synchronization. I'd like to write a cloud service that can also access the files.For example, if I record a video on my app, I'd like to ask my service to download the file, and send it to a transcoding service, or something.From the device, can I create an authenticated URL to the file? Alternatively, can I create a temporary token to send to the server, so that it can access the file? Then, when transcoding is complete, can I write back to the iCloud Drive?I'm mostly trying to avoid uploading the entire file from the device to the server, because the files might be quite large.I'm also trying to use iCloud Drive to support the seamless file sync between device and mac laptop without having to explicitly authenticate - that type of thing isn't supported by google drive, or dropbox, correct? Thanks very much in advance, I appreciate any help at all!
