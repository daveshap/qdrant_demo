Anxiety and drinking
Every time I go out with my friends I feel like I have to drink to get rid of my anxiety. This results in me getting really drunk before I really even notice it, and I start acting like a complete jackass. I try talking to new people thinking I have this new found confidence but I end up just embarrassing myself. I always wake up the next day with anxiety that is worse my hangover and swear that I'm never drinking again. This weekend was the lowest I think I've seen my self, I was  getting really belligerent and rude to everyone I talked to and feel like I made a really bad impression on some new friends. I think I need to take this as a hint to stop drinking all together, and to stop putting myself in these situations where I can make my anxiety worse.
