SALLY: So, you are William's wild young neighbor? Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family. I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
WILLIAM: George, I'm sorry.
SALLY: Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you! In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
WILLIAM: That's not what I said! Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me! Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
