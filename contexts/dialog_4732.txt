WALLACE: You have... you have a husband.
PRINCESS: I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
PRINCESS: You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
WALLACE: I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
PRINCESS: No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
