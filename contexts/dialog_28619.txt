BUNDY: You gotta stop 'em. We know it's Jack and Bobby's idea -- they leaked it to Lippman. The military guys are going ape, and they're not alone.
KENNY: Then they should speak up.
BUNDY: Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
KENNY: Yes it is.
BUNDY: No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong. We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
BUNDY: Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
KENNY: -- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
BUNDY: You know I don't mean they're weak.
