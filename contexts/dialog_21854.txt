DADDY: Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
WILLCOX HILLYER: Hello, Daddy. How are you?
DADDY: About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son. Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
WILLCOX HILLYER: It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
DADDY: It's Yankee whisky to me.
