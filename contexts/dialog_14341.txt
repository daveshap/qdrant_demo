ORDELL: You shot Melanie?
LOUIS: Twice. In the parking lot.
ORDELL: Couldn't talk to her?
LOUIS: You know how she is.
ORDELL: You couldn't just hit her?
LOUIS: Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
ORDELL: You shot her twice?
LOUIS: Uh-huh.
ORDELL: So you're sure she's dead.
LOUIS: Pretty sure.
ORDELL: Where did you shoot her?
LOUIS: In the chest and stomach.
ORDELL: Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
ORDELL: Louis?
LOUIS: What?
ORDELL: Where's the rest of it?
LOUIS: How much it there?
ORDELL: Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
LOUIS: You said five hundred and fifty!
ORDELL: So you light, ain't you. You light about a half-a-million.
LOUIS: Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
ORDELL: Came outta where?
LOUIS: The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
ORDELL: How long was she in there?
LOUIS: Maybe a minute. She came right out.
ORDELL: Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
LOUIS: Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
ORDELL: Then what?
LOUIS: We went to the parking lot.
ORDELL: Where you shot her.
LOUIS: That's right.
ORDELL: You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
LOUIS: Fuck you for asking me that.
ORDELL: Pull the car over.
ORDELL: What'd you shoot her with?
LOUIS: It's in there.
