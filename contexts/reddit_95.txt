Recently when ever my best friend comes over She just sits on her phone face timing and texting random dudes she has online and ignores me. I tried to tell her now it made me feel when she does this but she ignored me so I told her she can go home and talk to who ever she wants in private. She left and blocked me and we haven't spoken since Sunday. Yesterday I fly d out she is now dating my ex boyfriend that sexually assaulted me and she is now telling people that i lied about him doing it. My ptsd has been through the roof and I have had a few breakdowns. Last time one of my friends ignored my pleas to stay away from him she was also assaulted. One of my other friends knew a girl that killed herself because He had done it to her as well. His mom is a social worker and he gets away with everything. Even the cops defended him when they took my statement. I don't know what to do with how angry and scared I feel.
