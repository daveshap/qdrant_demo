Exporting symbols rather than points in .dxf I have a map I've made in QGIS which is points from a .csv file. These have then be turned into different symbols based on what they represent and then the sizes of said symbols based on values in the .csv.I need to export this as a .dxf to use in AutoCAD so it basically looks the same as it does in QGIS. However, when I do so it just exports as single dots (points). Is there a way I can export them as the symbols as I can see in QGIS?
