AMY: She's there, just like I said she'd be.
OLIVER: Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
AMY: Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
OLIVER: Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
AMY: But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
OLIVER: Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
AMY: But...
OLIVER: I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
