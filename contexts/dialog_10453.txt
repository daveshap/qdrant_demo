ARNOLD: After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses! Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
WASHINGTON: We're so damned important! Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
ARNOLD: Well, truth be told? I was a pharmacist. Alexander?
HAMILTON: I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix. But, then I went to King's College.
WASHINGTON: To learn to shoot cannon?
ARNOLD: Well, George, who were you?
WASHINGTON: I? You all know my history.
NATHANAEL GREENE: Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all. I mean, why would you want to win the war? You're not after glory, like Benedict... You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
WASHINGTON: You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
NATHANAEL GREENE: No. We're all of us after something. It's easy for me to fight for the common man. My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday? And what of my daughter or son? I know what I'm after. But now, with all this talk about compromise? It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
WASHINGTON: I will not betray you, Nathanael.
NATHANAEL GREENE: But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner. Sir.
WASHINGTON: At one time I could have chosen not to be.
NATHANAEL GREENE: Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
