Do President Trump's actions in respect to Ukraine constitute criminal bribery?
Recently there have been accusations from Rep. [Jackie Speier](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/469784-speier-says-impeachment-inquiry-shows-very-strong-case-of-bribery) and the Washington Post's [Eugene Robinson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/call-trumps-crime-what-it-is-bribery/2019/11/07/58903c60-01a1-11ea-8501-2a7123a38c58_story.html) that President Trump's conduct in respect to Ukraine constitutes the crime of bribery.

Both of them cite the withholding of approximately $400 million in military aid from Ukraine unless Ukraine announced an investigation of Joe Biden, a current [frontrunner](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/national/) for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Robinson particularly cites to 18 USC ยง 201(b) which says, in relevant part:

>Whoever... being a public official or person selected to be a public official, directly or indirectly, corruptly demands, seeks, receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally or for any other person or entity, in return for:

>>(A)being influenced in the performance of any official act; ...

>shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.

In contrast, Rep. [Andy Biggs](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-andy-biggs-lipstick-impeachment) has argued "there is no specific 'high crime' or 'misdemeanor' committed by the president."
