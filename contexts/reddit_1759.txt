Bruh y’all gotta remember this is applying to college not applying to T20s
Seriously. I posted a long in-depth recounting of my high school years, and how I managed to get by the college process with almost no stress. In the comments, I was criticized when someone found I’d only been accepted to my safeties (because my others haven’t come out yet). 


It’s disheartening. They told me it seemed like I slacked off in high school, and that that’s why I achieved “low levels of success.” 

Come on dawg. I just want people to know that the college process doesn’t HAVE TO BE HELL. It can be managed well. But some people just cannot handle me posting about how I got into good schools without stress, just bc I didn’t get into top 10 schools. 

I only bring it forward because their comments got an upsetting number of likes. 

I don’t care if you want to go to a top tier school, I really don’t, but come ON. I was just trying to give advice to those who find themselves stressing about the process, it was so uncalled for.
