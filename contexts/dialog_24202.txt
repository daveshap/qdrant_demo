KATRINA: These scars. How did you get them?
ICHABOD: I have had them since childhood. I cannot remember what from.
KATRINA: It would be interesting to find out.
ICHABOD: Here it is. A bird on one side. His cage on the other. Now, stare at it. The bird seems to be in his cage.
KATRINA: Yes, he does. May I try?
ICHABOD: He only appears to be inside the cage. The point being...
KATRINA: You made this, and the drawings?
ICHABOD: Yes, but listen. The illusion is easily explained. The eye retains each image, till they combine. And yet, some would call this toy magic.
KATRINA: Don't you see why? Look closely a moment. Put your intellect aside. Can't you see what is inexplicable?
KATRINA: Oh, you are hopeless. May I keep it at least?
ICHABOD: If you want. But...
KATRINA: Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
ICHABOD: Thank you. No. Here...
KATRINA: I insist that you have it.
ICHABOD: Very well. But, it will only sit gathering dust.
KATRINA: That would be a pity. Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
PHILIPSE: Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse. For stealing a horse! And, you dig up our dead.
ICHABOD: Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
PHILIPSE: We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables. Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
ICHABOD: I know it.
