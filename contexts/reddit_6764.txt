Help! I was referred to a company and built a relationship with a recruiter but I recently found out the recruiter was let go?
Hi I just wanted to get some advice on if theres anything I can possibly do to salvage the previous opportunity with this company? 

Background: 

I was referred to this company (my dream company) by a previous employee in which a recruiter reached out to me to set up a phone call. As I am still in college, a senior soon to be graduated, the recruiter wanted to keep in touch until January when positions for new grads would open up. However, a month after last talking to the recruiter, I checked her LinkedIn and it seems that she is no longer with the company. I'm not too sure what to do now as the recruiter really was my insurance that I would be given at least an interview for the position. Any advice? Thank you!
