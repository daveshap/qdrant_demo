18.04 Sound Through hdmi I have had an issue with sound ever since I installed Ubuntu. On boot up I can select HDMI sound and it works, when the monitor sleeps one of two things happen.Either the sound reverts to another source and I have to switch back to it in the settings, which is annoying but not unrecoverable, or the sound stays on the HDMI source but I get no sound and have to reboot to get it back.throughout this the HDMI source is always available and I can select it. but I always have one of the two issues.I am loving the experience with Linux at the moment but this is starting become a deal breaker, can someone please help ?thanks
