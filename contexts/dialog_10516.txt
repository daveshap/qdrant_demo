CHILI: I got you a copy of the script.
KAREN: I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
CHILI: What do you think?
KAREN: I think it's not horrible.
CHILI: I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
KAREN: Then you've read it?
CHILI: Not yet.
KAREN: You and Harry'll make a great team. I'm gonna make a deal with him.
CHILI: There a part in it for you?
KAREN: I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
CHILI: Sounds fair.
KAREN: What do you get out of it?
CHILI: That why you came over here, to ask me that?
KAREN: I want to know.
CHILI: Why does anyone want to be in movies?
KAREN: Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
CHILI: I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
KAREN: And you think the movie business is any different?
CHILI: Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
