Dating is Time-Consuming – 5 Tips Women Need to Stop Wasting Time
Dating is time-consuming.

Suppose, you're dating a confident and successful guy. But he's in a bad mood all the time. You put up with it, thinking that you’ll change him. Until finally, you get fed up and break up with him.

And then you regret the time lost.

Here's how you can stop wasting your time right now.


## Tip 1: Build a solid foundation with values

Let's say you meet a guy and he seems great. But then you realize he's dishonest. That's a clear sign the guy is wasting your time. Dishonesty isn't a good place to start.

What do you need for an amazing relationship? *A solid foundation.* But how do you build it exactly? You need to know your values and make sure they match those of your romantic partner.

To understand your values, ask yourself questions like these:

· What kind of a family do I want?

· How important is communication to me?

· How much integrity and self-discipline do I expect from a partner?

· How much negativity can I tolerate?

Now, you need a guy with similar values.

## Tip 2: Don't idealize him

Let me use Robin Williams as an example.

He married his first wife, Valerie, at 26. Soon, Valerie realized he couldn't be faithful to her.

But she idealized him:

*He's the great Robin Williams and I can live with his infidelity, I guess.*

But that was her head making the choice. Whereas in her heart, she knew she was betraying herself. And they got a divorce eventually.

That said, you might meet a great guy. He's confident, successful, and funny. But there's still something you don't like about him. Don't idealize him for those good qualities to avoid time-consuming dating.

*Listen not just to your head but also to your heart.*

## Tip 3: Don't change him

Suppose, a guy you're dating says he can't commit to a relationship right now. But he's great otherwise.

And you think, “I can change him. I'll make him commit.”

They say that people don't change. I believe they do but only as long as they want it. Just because you want him to change doesn't mean that he will.

That said, I respect you for the willingness to help him change. Feeling your support is very important for a man. It helps him build a business or career and also grow personally. But why waste your energy on someone who doesn't care?

*Save it for the right person!*

## Tip 4: Don't go along because you want to be nice

Let me illustrate with an example of a girl who had a suppressive father.

He would get angry often. And she learned to be nice to him in those moments. Otherwise, he wouldn't have loved her—a scary thought for a little girl.

Now in her early thirties, she met a guy who was strong, confident, and aggressive. This guy would get angry with her just as her father did. And without much thinking, she was nice to him in those moments as well. That was her default behavior learned in childhood.

But after a while, her resentment got so huge that she couldn't take it anymore. And she broke up with him. But with dating being so time-consuming, she lost so much time.

*So, don't be nice when it feels wrong.*

Ask yourself:

· Am I being unreasonably nice to my partner?

· Can I stop going along with what I don't like?

· How do I be more assertive about what I need?

· How can I set my boundaries and keep them up?

## Tip 5: Let him know and let him go

If you don't like something about a guy you're dating, you've got to let him know. And if he doesn't want to change, let him go.

Let's say he doesn't want to commit to a relationship. Sit down with him and talk about it.
