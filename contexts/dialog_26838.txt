RIPLEY: Hello Marge.
MARGE: Tom, you startled me! You're back.
RIPLEY: How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
MARGE: Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
RIPLEY: I was just looking at you -- so quiet.
MARGE: Where's Dickie?
RIPLEY: I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
MARGE: Ha. Did he say why?
RIPLEY: I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
MARGE: What does that mean?
RIPLEY: Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
MARGE: Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
RIPLEY: He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
MARGE: Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
RIPLEY: Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
MARGE: How long's he staying for?
RIPLEY: Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
