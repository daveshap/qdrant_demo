Anxiety After $500 Mistake
I've been working for this company for almost a year, it was the first job I found after moving to a new state, and early this week I wasted $500 in product by not shutting a freezer door all the way. I sat down with my boss and signed a notice confirming the mistake and we had a very stern conversation about communication and being thorough when locking up. I haven't had any other problems or mistakes, but I continuously have a sense of dread about being fired. 

Even though I recently turned down their offer to become a manager, as I'm not in a position to take on any extra responsibilities, I'm still being confronted about mistakes other coworkers make, giving me the sense I'm somehow responsible for them not completing something. 


How can I move on from this mistake and not make anymore? My chest feels tight and my breathing gets shallow whenever I think about work because I'm worried about something else being wrong or getting in trouble, even if I wasn't the person working on a project.
