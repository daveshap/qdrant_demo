Currently experiencing my anxiety nightmare. Reported sexual harassment at work and have a meeting with HR and the CEO in an hour. Willing myself not to puke.
Long story, but over a couple months, one of my bosses had been sexually harassing me. I kept trying to brush it off, but I didn't know how to stop it and it was making me extremely uncomfortable being around him. I had worked for this person for two years without incident, and he knows about my anxiety, need to please others, and my conflict avoidance. Literally one of my weaknesses in my performance evaluation is "trouble saying no to people". I am also half his age and he is many levels above me in the company. I was the perfect target. I finally confided in my supervisor, who gave me the courage to step forward. 
I wrote out a log of days and times and what occured, which was a good idea timeline-wise, but also kept me from having to repeat out loud what was said and done to me when I went to HR. HR was very professional and took it seriously, telling me it wasn't my fault and they were glad I came forward.
My harasser is on unpaid suspension while they conduct an investigation, interviewing others in his department to see if anyone else has observed anything else. 

I have a meeting with HR, the CEO, and the VP in an hour and I can't stop panicking. I don't know what they will ask me. And I am completely mortified that they all know what I let happen. I also feel intense guilt for ruining his career. He was the face to many of our projects, and I'm throwing such a wrench into it. I really trusted him, so when this all started, I had no idea what to do. 

I've been crying for days. Sweating constantly. I just want this over with and this has been the longest day of my life. I can't focus on work AT ALL and just want to go home and hide.
