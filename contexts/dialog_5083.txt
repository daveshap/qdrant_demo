NUKE: No! You're playing with my mind!
ANNIE: I'm trying to play with your body!
NUKE: I knew it--you're seducing me!
ANNIE: Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it-- Aren't I pretty?
NUKE: I think you're real cute.
ANNIE: Cute?! I hate cute! Baby ducks are cute! I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
NUKE: You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
ANNIE: Nuke! You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball. Ask Crash.
NUKE: I did.
ANNIE: What'd he say?
NUKE: He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
ANNIE: He did?
NUKE: I'll be back when we lose.
