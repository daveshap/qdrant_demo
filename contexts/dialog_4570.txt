CAESAR: Now why don't you go watch some TV or something?
MICKEY: Are you okay, Violet?
CAESAR: Mickey, why is Johnnie here? You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
MICKEY: Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
CAESAR: Sure, Mickey. Sure.
MICKEY: You shouldn't have to see this. Why don't you get out of here? Go for a walk.
VIOLET: Caesar wants me to stay.
MICKEY: Don't worry about Caesar. I'll handle Caesar. You just get out of here, okay?
