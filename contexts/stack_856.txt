Dual Boot with two SSDs and full Encryption I have a PC with two hard drives. Windows 10 is installed on C: (SSD) and I have an HDD (which is formatted in NTFS, I want to use that HDD for both OSs), Windows is installed in UEFI mode.<br>I want to buy another SSD and build that one in my PC and install Ubuntu 18.04 on it.Furthermore I'd like the two SSDs to be fully encrypted (maybe with VeraCrypt). In my point of view I have to do the following steps:Build in the new SSDInstall Ubuntu on the SSDAfter Installation encrypt Windows and Ubuntu Installation with VeraCryptIs that the right way? Is there something I have to keep in mind during installation?Edit (27.07.2018)I understand, that I have to encrypt Ubuntu during installation with LUKS. What I quite don't know is how to create the partitions.I'll have two partitions:/dev/sdc1 - fat32 - /boot - 500 MB/dev/sdc2 - ? - / - rest of ssd sizeDo I have to choose ext4 root or do I have to choose physical volume for encryption?
