SCHAEFFER: Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
ELAINE: He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
SCHAEFFER: Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
ELAINE: Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
SCHAEFFER: Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
ELAINE: I don't know where he is.
SCHAEFFER: But... if you had to guess?
MCELROY: She say where he is?
SCHAEFFER: I don't think she knows.
SCHAEFFER: What about Carter?
MCELROY: Tight. But I'm working on him.
SCHAEFFER: Lean on him.
