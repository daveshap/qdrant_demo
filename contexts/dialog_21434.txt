VIVIAN: What did you do to him?
EDWARD: What do you mean?
VIVIAN: Last time I saw him he was this strong guy. Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
EDWARD: Vivian, I want you to listen to me. The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
VIVIAN: Right.
EDWARD: It's not your concern. It's... business, that's all.
VIVIAN: Business.
EDWARD: Yes. The man made a business decision.
VIVIAN: It's all just business to you. Him. Me. Your life. Everything's business.
EDWARD: It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
