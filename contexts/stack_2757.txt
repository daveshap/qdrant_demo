How are real particles created? The textbooks about quantum field theory I have seen so far saythat all talk in popular science literatureabout particles being created spontaneously out ofvacuum is wrong. Instead, according to QFT those virtual particles areunobservable and are justa mathematical picture of the perturbation expansion of the propagator.What I have been wondering is, how did the real particles, which are observable, get created? How does QFT describe pair production, in particular starting with vacuum and ending with a real, on-shell particle-antiparticle pair?Can anybody explain this to me and point me to some textbooksor articles elaborating on this question (no popular science, please)?
