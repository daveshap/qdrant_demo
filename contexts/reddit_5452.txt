What certificates can you get thatd help you get an office/administrative job?
I just got laid off a few days ago, and I'm looking for work in an office/hospital/bank setting doing administrative work. I have two years of office experience, two years of retail experience, and I'm good with Excel and Microsoft office, but I don't have a college degree. Is there any certificates you can work on that'd make you more attractive to these types of positions?
