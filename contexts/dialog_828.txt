HUNTER: I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
ROBY: I guess I had it coming. Let's call it settled.
ROBY: Would somebody fill me in?
STANDARD: He went into the pyramid alone. We lost radio contact with him. When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
HUNTER: Where did it come from?
MELKONIS: <u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
HUNTER: How does he breathe?
MELKONIS: Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
HUNTER: Yeah, but how? His nose and mouth are blocked.
