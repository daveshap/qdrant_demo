Should I tell recruiters that I am currently in the process of searching for jobs with other recruiters?
At the moment, I have multiple applications running at the same time with multiple recruiters, in hopes that I will be hired for at least one. Would it be a good idea to let each of them know of what I am doing? If I am offered multiple positions(a very unlikely if), I want to be able to have a few days to decide which one to accept. 

I also want to avoid a situation such as accepting an offer, then being given another offer by the other recruiter afterwards, one that I might prefer more.
