BOBBY: Rayette.
RAYETTE: What?
BOBBY: Just finish eating.
RAYETTE: Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
CARL: No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
RAYETTE: I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing... Is there any ketchup around?
BOBBY: Oh, for chrissakes...
CARL: Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
RAYETTE: It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
BOBBY: I don't, huh?
