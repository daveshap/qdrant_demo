Binding energy of the daughter nucleus In radioactivity, the total binding energy of parent nucleus must be greater than the daughter nucleus. In alpha decay, uranium has greater binding energy because it is large but in beta plus decay (positron) proton changes to neutron then binding energy of the daughter nucleus must increase so how can this happen?
