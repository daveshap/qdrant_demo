KORDA: You don't have to come here.
ROPER: Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
KORDA: Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
ROPER: Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
