[META] Thank you and goodbye to /u/Kazmarov
When I first made NeutralPolitics, I did not expect much of a response from the reddit community.

When we reached 2,000 subscribers in less than two days, it became clear that people were taking the idea seriously. This was not a one man job.

Then, /u/Kazmarov came along. Together, we recruited a mod team. We hammered out the initial rules. We lost sleep.

Not long into the sub's existence, circumstances forced me to leave the team for six months. He stepped up, leading the community and training new mods to keep the sub on course. Kaz has spent countless hours making NeutralPolitics what it is today, and I can say for certain that it would not be here if it weren't for his help.

Last night, Kaz announced that he was stepping down after three and a half years of moderating. I would like to personally thank Kaz for all of the work that he has put into this place, and wish him the best of luck wherever he goes from here.

Rock on, brother.
