I am Shira A. Scheindlin. I was formerly a United States District Judge. Ask me Anything.
I served as a U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York for 22 years.  Years before that I served as a federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York.  I also served as a United States Magistrate Judge in the Eastern District of New York.  I practiced law and have taught at several law schools.  I have authored a case book for law students on discovery of electronic evidence.  I have also spoken widely on the subject of race and policing as I am the author of the landmark opinion in Floyd v. City of New York, which ended the unlawful use of stop and frisk by the New York City Police Department when not conducted in a manner that comported with constitutional requirements.  Below are a few pieces I've authored since leaving the bench last year:
