More work and less pay, but happier. I didn't expect this.
My funding ran out after 4 years in my PhD program and I had to TA starting this semester at a campus which offers a lower stipend than what I had before. To get to the campus, I had to buy a car and drive \~50 minutes each way for 3 days a week, which leaves me with much less disposable income. 

It sounds like a bad situation, and I thought I would hate it, but surprisingly, my mental health has actually improved. I found out I enjoy teaching (I lead a lab) and I'm more motivated to do TA work than research. This goes against what everyone else has been telling me, so I feel conflicted. Maybe the lonely grind is really getting to me and I like the temporary escape from the research work, or maybe I geniunely enjoy teaching and inspiring young minds, I haven't been doing this for long enough to tell. But I know I don't have to drag myself out of bed to go teaching, unlike when I have to go to the lab to do research. The downgrade in pay hasn't bothered me so much, since I'm a minimalist. I work more hours now, but I feel happier and more fulfilled. 

At this point, I'm actually considering a career focused on teaching, and I'm thankful that the TA experience has provided me with this insight. Anyone else with similiar experiences?
