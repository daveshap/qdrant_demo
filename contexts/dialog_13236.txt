ANNA: Come on, this stuff will knock you out. Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
HAWK: Never, why do you ask?
HAWK: Whoa. Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
ANNA: Sure Hudson. Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
HAWK: Could you believe that crazy elephant?
HAWK: Whoa, part 2. Does it go to Times Square?
ANNA: Delivers up to ten at night. The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals. It's actually not that an unusual set-up. The secret passageway on the other hand....
HAWK: The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
ANNA: Nice. But right out of our brochure.
HAWK: Oh, you read that.
ANNA: Actually I wrote it. It's a good sentence. It can apply to people.
HAWK: You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
ANNA: I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls. And I buy my own clothes. My life's a little boring...
HAWK: God, I wish I could say the same thing. What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
ANNA: I'll bring my entire repertoire...
HAWK: And I'll bring my entourage...
ANNA: Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to. There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's. Say 10:30.
HAWK: Said.
