What is the precedent for Law Enforcement refusing to enforce certain laws they find Unconstitutional, and how is this countered/balanced out?
[12 Washington Sheriffs are Refusing To Enforce The State's New Gun Laws for constitutional reasons until it's been decided on in court.](https://www.opb.org/news/article/washington-gun-law-storage-background-checks-sheriffs/)

I am just curious on how often this happens, the legality of it, and if there is a method with which this is countered/checked and balanced, is it through judicial review?
