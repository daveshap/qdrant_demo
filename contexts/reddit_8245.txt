Could Trump use the military to build the wall?
Today, [President Trump threatened that if his wall did not get funding, then he would use the military to build it.](https://nypost.com/2018/12/11/trump-military-will-build-border-wall-if-democrats-dont-vote-for-it/) Is this legal? Would it be in violation of the [Posse Comitatus Act?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act) Since the wall did not get funding from congress, would the military be allowed to put funds towards it, and if not would this be a violation of the [Anti-deficiency Act?](https://www.gao.gov/legal/appropriations-law-decisions/resources/)

edit: [As FlatusGiganticus pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/a58jla/could_trump_use_the_military_to_build_the_wall/ebl8g1z/) the Army Corp of Engineers is under the Army and does work within the US all of the time. Therefore the Posse Comitatus Act does not seem to be in play here.
