HARRY: It's chow, Animal! Chow!
STOSH: Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
HARRY: No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
STOSH: I don't care if they wear galoshes!
HARRY: You want Betty Grable!
STOSH: Let me go!
HARRY: Betty Grable!
HARRY: Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
STOSH: Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
HARRY: How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
STOSH: What's the award?
HARRY: What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
STOSH: Me? What if she don't want me?
HARRY: If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
STOSH: You're teasing me again!
HARRY: Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
