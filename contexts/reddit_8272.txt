Is Trump violating the First Amendment by blocking Twitter users?
A group called The Knight First Amendment Institue just published an open letter to Donald Trump which can be seen here:

A summary of the purpose of this letter can be found here:

Overall the purpose of this seems to be that they believe Twitter is considered a “designated public forum” for 1st amendment purposes. As a result, Twitter users can not be blocked by Trump (and I assumed it can be inferred by any government official) due to the fact that blocked users can no longer see, copy, post, or otherwise interact with said government officials twitter posts. 

Is there any merit to this argument? It seems novel at the very least, though obfuscated some by the fact as far as I know he is still using his personal Twitter account as opposed to the government sanctioned one.
