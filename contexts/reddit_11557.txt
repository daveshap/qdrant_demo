Sick of my social anxiety and fear of public speaking
I'm 35 FUCKING years old and still have a problem introducing myself in a group. Heart races, voice cracks, and I fumble words. 

I have a 5 minute presentation at work next week and it's like a dark cloud over my head. I plan on over-preparing to help, but who knows if it will work. 

Fucking sick of it...
