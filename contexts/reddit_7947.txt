Documenting code... Do you always do it?
I just started my first semester of grad school doing computational biology. I have joined a lab, and this is really the first time I’ve programmed as more than just a hobbyist. I’ve always been anal about commenting code, but it seems that most people in the lab don’t. 

Also, our PI is always encouraging us to complete as much as possible each week. So, it seems natural to skimp out on comments for the sake of speed. 

Does anyone have advice on how they document code or what impacts undocumented code may have on publishing results?
