PETER: Hi. It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
HELEN: Who was the man in the basement?
PETER: You like that action? Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>? The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
HELEN: Where are you, Peter?
PETER: <u>You</u> thought I was going to do Ted Bundy next, so you sent your partner...
PETER: What was that? What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
HELEN: It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
PETER: Mm-hmm. I can't get to you. You have to come to me.
HELEN: You know I can't do that.
PETER: Oh, I think you will.
