RENAULT: Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
RICK: That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
RENAULT: Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans? Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
RICK: Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
RENAULT: Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
RICK: Well, it looks like you're a little late.
RENAULT: Huh?
RICK: So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
RENAULT: Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
