How to politely/effectively get contractors to realize they are misreading my location on my resume/profile?
In the past, my previous jobs were located in Arizona. However, starting March 21st, I moved into my new residence in Alabama, and accepted a temporary retail job during the COVID-19 quarantine just to pay rent. In April, I decided to rework my resume and create a profile on DICE.com for an IT job. However, despite the fact that my current state of Alabama is mentioned twice before any mentions of Arizona, and that my DICE profile didn't even exist until I had already been living here, every contractor or recruiter than calls me says the same thing: "But your profile has you listed in Arizona." It doesn't. It never did. But how do I get all these contractors to realize they hadn't been reading without turning away future contractors who will undoubtedly make the same mistake? No one likes to be blamed for a mistake, and it isn't a good way to make people want to hire you. How should I approach this for next time?
