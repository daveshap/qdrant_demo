LEIA: Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there? How's Luke?
LUKE: He'll survive.
CHEWIE: Howls.
LANDO: We're not out of this yet.
LANDO: The deflector shields are gone.
LEIA: Are the coordinates set?
LEIA: This hyperdrive had better work.
LUKE: I've never seen it fail.
LANDO: I'm sure my men fixed it. We've got nothing to worry about.
LEIA: That sounds familiar.
LEIA: Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
CHEWIE: Barks his agreement.
