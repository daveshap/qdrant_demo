I'm really jealous.
To cut a long story short and down to the main issue, I'm really jealous of one of my closest friends. I'm jealous of everything he is, has and stands for: his job, his flat, his girlfriend, his looks, his character... I feel really awful and hate myself for it because I'm supposed to feel happy for him doing so well but I'm scared that given the right opportunity at the right moment I would seriously hurt him. He doesn't know. I don't know what to do.
