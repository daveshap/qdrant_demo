Is being a teacher as good of a job as I think it is?
I have been a nanny since I got my Bachelor's in Psychology 2 years ago. I make $17 an hour. I know teachers aren't paid what they should be, but the salary & benefits are a heck of a lot better than what I have now. Also, an average of 13 more weeks off per year than the average American worker... sounds pretty great to me. Thoughts?
