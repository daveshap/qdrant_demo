Should prostitution be legal, illegal, or decriminalized in the west?
[As it stands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_by_region), most of the west handles prostitution with some degree of prohibition or criminalization, whether it be on purchasers, sex workers, related acts (running a brothel, pimping, etc.), or all three. While some nations like the Netherlands and Germany have fully legalized the industry, restriction is still the status quo.

Associated with this issue are a wide array of problems and questions, such as human trafficking, the role of the state, the morality of the act of prostitution itself, the freedom and health of women involved, and so on. Many support full legalization, for reasons that typically include minimizing harm, promoting health and safety, and eliminating non-violent/victimless crimes ([example](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-raphael/legalize-prostitution_1_b_4251956.html)). Others support continued criminalization or restriction on the basis of traditional moral rejection of prostitution. Other still support continued criminalization for buyers because they view the industry and inherently predatory and abusive, and fear legalization would expand it and increase instances of things like sex trafficking ([example](https://nordicmodelnow.org)).
