MONICA: What do I have to do?
QUINCY: I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together. And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
MONICA: I don't like flowers.
QUINCY: Oh.
MONICA: How bout Twinkies? My mom won't ever buy them.
QUINCY: Kay.
MONICA: Okay.
QUINCY: I think we gotta kiss now.
MONICA: For how long?
QUINCY: Five seconds.
MONICA: I want to ride my own bike.
QUINCY: My Dad always drives my Mom.
MONICA: So?
QUINCY: So that means I have to ride with you.
MONICA: I don't have to do what you say.
QUINCY: Man, forget you then, stupid.
MONICA: You're stupid. And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
