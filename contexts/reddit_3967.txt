Today I (27F) asked someone out for the first time in years! It was terrifying.
I dont know if I should put this here or if anyone will read it, but here it goes..

Back story: My ex and I dated on and off for 5 years. We had a cute start-up story. We both worked in a King Soopers. I was his barista and he was my banker. I asked HIM out on a date. (Trophy points for me). I loved him with everything I had and he was my world. He was my first real love and I cared for him deeper than I ever cared for anyone. Throughout our relationship, I chose not to see how he was mentally and emotionally abusive to me so much so that I completely lost my confidence and who I was as a person. Manipulation really puts a toll on the soul. He officially left me 2 months ago leaving me feeling like everything was my fault while I was already going through a very dark time in my life. 

Present tense: I have been seeing a therapist to try to understand who I am without him. My therapist and I have been very proud of my progress and I found my fire again! Yay me! 
Today I walked up to someone that I've been flirting with and found extremely attractive. We seem to click well and I needed to see where this would lead. I was terrified. Rejection is one of my biggest fears. Despite this, I walked right up to him and asked him out (shaking but tried to portray confidence)... verdict is, he said, "of course". 

People of Reddit: Ask him/her out! Take the leap. Find that courage. Remember you are worth alot, and if the other person cant see that, it's alright! As long as you see it and the good ones will see it too. Good luck in the dating world! It can be challenging, but it is only a part of life and should never define you. :)
