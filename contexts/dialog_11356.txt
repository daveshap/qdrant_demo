LAMBEAU: Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
SEAN: We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
SEAN: Jobs doing what?
LAMBEAU: Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
SEAN: That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
LAMBEAU: Sean, I really don't think you understand--
SEAN: What don't I understand?
LAMBEAU: Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
TIMMY: Uh-oh.
LAMBEAU: Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
TIMMY: Yeah, cured polio.
LAMBEAU: You've heard of Albert Einstein?
LAMBEAU: How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
TIMMY: No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.
TIMMY: So who won the bet?
LAMBEAU: I did.
