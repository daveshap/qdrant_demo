I'm a well-educated person with many interests and hobbies. Why is it so hard for me to find a career I enjoy doing?
I have a BS in finance and fresh out of college, worked at a couple banks as an analyst and hated the "corporate-ness". So I switched and published a comic book last year to see if I'd like to do art, but became too stressed out when my hobby started becoming my job and it wasn't fun anymore. HELP. I can't find anything I actually want to do for money.
