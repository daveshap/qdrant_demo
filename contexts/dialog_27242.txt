SCULLY: Had you.
MULDER: No you didn't.
SCULLY: Oh yeah. Had you big time.
SCULLY: I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
MULDER: Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
SCULLY: I just did. You're buying.
MULDER: Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
SCULLY: Something sweet.
