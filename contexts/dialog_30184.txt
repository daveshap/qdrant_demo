KUJAN: Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
VERBAL: I don't.
KUJAN: YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
KUJAN: TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
VERBAL: I don't know what you're talking about.
KUJAN: YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
VERBAL: I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
KUJAN: Then why didn't you help him?
VERBAL: I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
KUJAN: But Keaton...
VERBAL: It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
