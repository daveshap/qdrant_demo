GEORGE: Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
POP: Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
GEORGE: You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
POP: This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
GEORGE: Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
