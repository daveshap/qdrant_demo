MARTY: Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
CLARA: Nothing.
MARTY: I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
CLARA: I'd like that very much.
MARTY: The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
CLARA: I'll wait for your call.
MARTY: We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
CLARA: All right.
