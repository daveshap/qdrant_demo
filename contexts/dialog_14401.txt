MICHAEL: Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
JACOB: No. I couldn't.
MICHAEL: What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too. This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
JACOB: I don't know what to say.
MICHAEL: Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
JEZZIE: What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this? Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
JACOB: I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
JEZZIE: Are you out of your mind?
JACOB: Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
JEZZIE: God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
JACOB: Me neither.
JEZZIE: What's gotten into you?
JEZZIE: It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
JACOB: I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
JEZZIE: It's so hard to believe.
