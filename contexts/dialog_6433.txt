DRUMLIN: They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.

JEAN-CLAUDE: Very well. Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions. Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us. You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
ELLIE: We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction. Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
