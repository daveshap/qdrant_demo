"You were my charity case and you still fell short."
... Is (paraphrased) the last thing one of my professors said to me.  I wanted/needed an A- in his class and he gave me a B+, and that was essentially what he said when I asked politely and nonconfrontationally if he could find it in him to bump my grade, and stated my reasoning.  

I had a really hard time this year.  It's my first year of PhD and I went straight from undergrad.  My program requires a 3.5 GPA to qualify to take the preliminary exam, and because of a difficult adjustment period last semester related largely to my existing mental health issues, ADHD/Autism, I was borderline.  I'm still borderline because my university is allowing students to either take a passing grade (S) or request a letter grade conversion in light of the pandemic and I barely made an A- in my other class.  I had been doing fine this semester until the pandemic hit and what structure I had was just ripped out from under me.

I'm just so sick of feeling like I'm not good enough and needing to exhaust myself constantly bowing and scraping and justifying to get the help and understanding I need, only for it to not even pay off in the end.  I worked so damn hard to get here, and it feels like it could all slip through my fingers at any moment with the slightest misstep.  I feel like I'm constantly letting myself and everyone else down.  Summer started this week and I haven't even managed to get off my ass and do my research.
