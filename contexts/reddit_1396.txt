Ever since I got blue hair I've realised people weren't looking at me before. They are now, and hopefully if I go back to my natural colour I'll be able to remember the difference
Before, i always thought people were looking at me and judging me. They weren't, and I can tell now, because I now know how it feels for people to actually be looking at me aha.
