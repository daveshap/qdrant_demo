ZACK: I'm looking for Sid.
PAULA: So?
ZACK: Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
PAULA: Why'd he do it?
ZACK: Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
PAULA: I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
ZACK: I don't know where that is.
SID: Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
LYNETTE: What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
SID: Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
LYNETTE: I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
SID: No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.
LYNETTE: Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
SID: That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
LYNETTE: Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
SID: We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
LYNETTE: You what?
SID: I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
LYNETTE: But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
SID: Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
LYNETTE: Sid, there's no baby.
SID: What?
LYNETTE: I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
SID: Well, I'll be goddamned.
