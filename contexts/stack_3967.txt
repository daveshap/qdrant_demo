Why does One Way ANOVA not have an SSE Term? For a Two Way ANOVA with two factors A and B, the Sum of Square equation is:-SSTO = SSA + SSB + SSAB + SSEWhere,<br>SSTO = Total Sum of Squares <br>SSA = Sum of Squares due to Factor A <br>SSB = Sum of Squares due to Factor BSSAB = Sum of Squares due to Interaction of Factor A and Factor BSSE = Amount of Variability left unexplained taken as errorNow my question is, why does One Way ANOVA not have a SSE Term?FYI, <br>Im reading this book, Intermediate Statistics for Dummies.I was reading about ANOVA. For one way ANOVA the book says that the Total Sum of Squares is the Sum of Squares within and Sum of Squares Between. There is no Sum of Square Error Term in one way ANOVA. That's why I am asking this question.
