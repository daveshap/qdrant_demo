Need some advice...
So I'm a high school guy that's absolutly an anti-social nervous wreck most of the time, but the past year I've really tried to be more outgoing andput myself out there. At the beginning of the last school year, my junior year, I asked a friend, who I've known since kindergarten and the couple years before started to have feelings for, out to a concert, not on a date, but with a group. First of all, she texted me later and said no. It kinda hurt, but that wasn't really the problem. All school year she was friendly once and awhile, but usually tried to ignore me. I even asked her if I had done something wrong, and she couldn't even look at me as she no and ran off. Long story short, we're not as close and I got over it. 

Now, a year later, there's one other girl who just graduated that I know and really like. We've talked a few times, we go to the same church/youth group, like the same stuff/hobbies, but while everyone I've talked to said the first time want my fault, I'm afraid of I try to talk to her or anything I'll ruin it as soon as she figures it out. 

It sucks cause I'm not known for being outgoing in my small high school and people seem to act like it's weird when I'm anything but shy. How do I get to know her better and eventually let her know how I feel without coming off as weird?
