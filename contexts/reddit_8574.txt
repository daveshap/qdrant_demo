In October the retaliatory tariffs and intense negotiations started with over a third new regulations added to the agreement and it is said to address the social impact of international trade as no trade agreement has before.

Obviously Congress will still have to vote on it before the current session ends in December, but the deal could face new challenges in 2019. If approved, it would likely take effect around Jan. 1, 2020. Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and a self-described free trader, said the biggest difference between this deal and NAFTA is the name. In terms of substance, he said about 90 percent of the original NAFTA agreement stays in place under the USMCA.

Is that statement accurate? 

Is USMCA better for the US just because it starts with US? 

If not, how is it different and why?
