WICKWIRE: They're more afraid of you.
JORDAN: Well, now I feel so much better.
WICKWIRE: It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all. To your face, anyway.
JORDAN: Whose orders were those?
WICKWIRE: It was made clear. Anyway, stay ballsy. First week's hell, then it levels out. Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway. That's hell-and-a-half.
JORDAN: And how do you know that?
WICKWIRE: Made it to Week 10 last time.
JORDAN: I didn't know they let you try again. Especially at your age.
WICKWIRE: You're kind of a surprise yourself.
