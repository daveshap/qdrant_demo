Looking to connect with others who have worked in East Michigan
Hi everyone! I'm currently looking for positions on the east side of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Plymouth, Detroit, Lansing, Jackson).

I have been in West Michigan my whole life so I'd love to chat with folks that currently work or have worked at institutions in these areas. I'm just trying to get a feel for the institutions and their communities. If you're willing to chat me with, just send me message.

Thanks!
