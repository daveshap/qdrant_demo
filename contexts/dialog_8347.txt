GIN: It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
MAC: And the money goes--
GIN: Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
MAC: But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
GIN: Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
MAC: A parting gift from the Empire.
GIN: Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
