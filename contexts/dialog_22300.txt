BETTY BOOP: Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie. We miss you in Toontown.
VALIANT: Wish I could say the same. What're you doin' here, Betty?
BETTY BOOP: Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color. But I still got it, Eddie... 'Boop boop be-doop'.
VALIANT: Yeah, you still got it, Betty. Who's Mr. Jocularity?
BETTY BOOP: That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
VALIANT: Shoulda guessed.
BETTY BOOP: He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
VALIANT: Big on the musical comedy, huh?
BETTY BOOP: Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
