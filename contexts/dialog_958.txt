PARSONS: Where'd you leave them?
KAMEN: Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range. They're making their own way back tomorrow.
CASSIE: MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
KAMEN: Shit. When?
CASSIE: Yesterday. We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'. Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
KAMEN: Fucking great. I invested some money in them.
CASSIE: You win some, you loose some.
KAMEN: I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock. Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
CASSIE: No, but I got something that might interest you.
