Will an IDS degree hurt me
Posted this In r/askacademia before I found this subreddit

Yesterday I was told I would not be able to take my senior seminar for the History department. I did not get through the review committee for the research for my senior monograph. The only way to graduate on time (I am a junior) was to switch to an interdisciplinary studies degree. 
    I want to go into admissions when I graduate and see where my career goes from there. Is the IDS degree going to hold me back?
