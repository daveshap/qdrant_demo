CLAY: It's not what you think.
HANNA: I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go. We are having a guest for breakfast.
CLAY: I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
HANNA: There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
CLAY: Maybe. But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
HANNA: I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late. I only hope you did not get him excited. It could give him a new stroke.
CLAY: Thanks. Why do you do it?
HANNA: What do I do?
CLAY: Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
HANNA: It is my job. I did it when he was happy and it was easy. It is only fair I do it now when he is ill. Enough talk. I must wake up the master.
