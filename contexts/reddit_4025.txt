Confronted Ghoster
I should have done this a long time ago but I finally did it. I finally spoke my truth instead of acting like I’m cool with everything he does. 

I used to date this guy and while I thought things were going well, he ghosted me. And then came back months later like nothing happened. That should’ve been when I confronted him but I didn’t. A few months ago the topic came up over text and he told me he was depressed at the time and apologized. I accepted the apology but never wanted to see him again. 

I haven’t seen him ever since but we do talk sometimes. Yesterday over the phone he spoke about meeting up. I said— I’m not going anywhere with you because I never want to see you again. he said why not? And I said “why, so you can disappear again and come back like nothing happened? I understand you were going through something at the time but that doesn’t mean you just leave the other person hanging. I felt very disrespected and I hope you don’t ever put anyone else through that” I tried to keep my tone as calm and nice as possible lol. Yeah I may seem crazy that it still bothers me til this day but I can’t risk getting my feelings hurt again. I still don’t know what his intentions were/are. 

It was hard to do but I’m glad I did. Not sure if I’ll ever hear from him again. Probably will on ig. I just had to be honest with myself. I did not mention how much I miss him and how much I enjoyed spending time with him because I didn’t want to give him a ego boost. 
F ghosters and ppl who lead other ppl on.
