Help
So my parents go to church and me and my siblings are always dragged along. The chruchs we go to are always full of people and it's always has been uncomfortable for me. Lately i've been having panic attacks or what seem to be them anyways and whenever i go to my parents about it they just tell to suck it up or that i'm being silly. I dont know what to do about and i dont even know if i should do anything about it. 
How do i even start getting over the panic attacks?
