How to handle rude coworker?
I have a much younger coworker who is not handling stress well. We are on the same level but her role is administrative and mine is not. We are attempting to achieve quite a challenging thing at the moment and multiple times over the past week she has become snappy, irritable and rude instead of solution oriented or communicative. Yesterday when we tried to discuss the challenges, instead of listening to what was happening on my end she spoke to me in front of another coworker as if I was 5 and impatiently berated me and I am really really not happy with the situation. Any advice?
