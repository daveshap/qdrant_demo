Poor furlough management
I was furloughed from my company mid-week through email. No phone call, just a very impersonal two sentence email. I have a meeting with my direct manager tomorrow who doesn’t seem to have had a say in the matter with management. Do I schedule a separate call with management to air my concerns about how I was furloughed? I am concerned that my concerns that I speak with my manager about won’t get up to managements ears. 

For context, I’ve been at the company a little over a year. I am the 2nd most senior person on my team. I don’t get paid extraordinarily more than others on my team, and have been rewarded for my hard work in the past. 

I wasn’t given a reason for why I was furloughed and have been working from home the past several months due to the pandemic. The company chose to keep assistants but furlough roles with more responsibilities.
