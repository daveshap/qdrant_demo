HEALY: I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
SULLY: Am I?
HEALY: Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
SULLY: Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
HEALY: Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
