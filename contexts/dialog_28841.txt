GASTON: Who?
LILY: The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
GASTON: The tennis player?
LILY: The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded. Baron, I shouldn't have come!
GASTON: But you came. And you must forget everything-- except that you are here, Countess.
