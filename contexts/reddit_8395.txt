What is the legal justification for excluding a candidate from the ballot if he or she doesn't release his/her tax returns?
[Illinois just became the latest state join the push for Trump's tax returns by threatening to exclude him from the 2020 ballot if he doesn't comply.](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/illinois-president-tax-returns/index.html)

I did a little research and the closest I could find in terms of precedent was [Powell vs McCormack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell_v._McCormack), where an elected Representative was asked to abstain from taking the oath of office because he was embroiled in legal troubles. As a result there was a complicated multiple-court battle that prompted a new law being brought in to better handle contested elections.

What is the legal reasoning a State could use to justify excluding a Presidential candidate, particularly one who had already been elected once, had been nominated for a a second run, and wasn't excluded from other states, from their Presidential ballot? What challenges could Trump and other lawmakers use to counter this?

Moreover, does complicating the process of voting for a candidate by essentially forcing voters to put him/her as a write-in (potentially dissuading voters from voting in the first place and likely damaging the candidate's party's downballot votes) count as voter supression?
