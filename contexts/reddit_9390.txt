There was an issue with my rent payment but it came with a comforting realization
Today I got a letter on my door from my landlord stating that I had not paid my rent this month and now owed $1320 including a late fee. 


I knew I paid rent in full on the 1st so I put in a phone call to my landlord to figure out what happened. While I was waiting for a phone call back I was surprised that I was not panicking, which I definitely would have had it been last year. But I realized I still had enough money in my account to pay rent again if the worst case scenario weâ€™re to happen (they lost my rent payment and I had to battle it out with the money order company to get a refund). 


I would have been okay and not struggling and able to pay rent again and pay the bills thanks to this sub. It was such a freeing feeling to know that I have saved enough to cover for situations like this. 


Thankfully the landlord called me back and told me they found the rent and had meant to put that notice on another tenants door. So it ended well but made me appreciate my now good money habits.
