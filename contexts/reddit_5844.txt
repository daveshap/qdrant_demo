Nextopic announcement for our 2nd event, Future of Work!
Hello r/jobs, We are pleased to announce our 2nd event, a conference on the Future of Work!

Experts from various fields will explore how work is changing in our modern work, and we will make another announcement showcasing our individual speakers as we get closer to the event. We will look into general content on the sociological impact of working from home, what this means for families and industries and how work in modern society came to be. We will discuss how innovations in technology such as AR/VR, Virtual reality and Data Science are bringing about a new era in the state of "work" and the opportunities and challenges that arise from it. This event is tentatively set for mid-August. 

In the coming weeks more content will be published on our website, Instagram, Facebook and our subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/Nextopic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nextopic/) ! This content will be far more regular than in the past as we've grown our team to be able to increase production throughput.
