MITCHELL: Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
BETTY: Very nice Mitchell turns.
MITCHELL: No thanks?
BETTY: Thank you.
MITCHELL: Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
BETTY: I'm supposing.
MITCHELL: I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector. A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
MITCHELL: I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
BETTY: Yes?
MITCHELL: How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
BETTY: 
MITCHELL: Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
MITCHELL: Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
BETTY: Not tonight.
MITCHELL: What's the matter?
BETTY: I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
MITCHELL: We have some nice places around Vancouver.
BETTY: I'm sure you have.
MITCHELL: Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock? A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
BETTY: I haven't been invited.
MITCHELL: Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
BETTY: Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
MITCHELL: Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
