A message to future international STEM applicants, particularly Asian students
Admittedly, I'm using a throwaway account.

I'm currently an international freshman student at a certain college in America. I wanted to share some (unasked-for) insight for future international applicants who are interested in STEM.

First, my stats. I want to emphasize that I have no intention to brag about my accomplishments, so please don't take this the wrong way.

(To keep my anonymity, most stats are kept vague but are written so that the gist is understandable)

I am an Asian male looking to major in a certain field in engineering.

GPA:  4.0/4.0 (Constantly in the top two throughout all my years of high school, which is one of the top three high schools in my country. We need to pass multiple tests to enter our high school.)

SAT: 1560/1600, first try (not that that means anything)

SAT 2: 800/800, 800/800, first try (Math 2 and a certain science subject test)

Extracurricular activities *(Most are kept vague to preserve my anonymity):*

* Invented/Discovered a certain new thing under the mentoring of a university professor, published paper and accepted to present at an international conference
* Won national competition in a certain field. The twist was that other than me every other participant was a  college student pursuing their masters degree in the field
* Captain of a high school team competing for a certain well-known international contest
* Won in multiple national contests related to my field
* Started multiple clubs at my school, and every club has won a national award of some sort
* Recognized and was provided full-ride scholarship grant by my country for the four years of my college (excuse my passive voice)
* etc.

Most professors in my country who are in my field of interest knew who I was from my research and I've been interviewed for a news article too-which isn't an extracurricular, but I want to emphasize that my application can probably be considered to stand at a very high level.

Essays:

In my senior year, I've written 1216 essays (This includes short 100 word essays all the way up to the common app). I know; it sounds like BS, but it's true.

International students *WORK THEIR ASSES OFF.* I remember living on an hour of sleep and spending a constant five to six hours every day writing and rewriting essays for a whole year. I had everybody I knew (including a relative who has experience with college applications/essays) and consultant professionals check my essays.

After a grueling 1216 essays I was confident that my final products were the best I could produce. My common app way my revision number 83. I did everything I could, paying attention to each and every word in every essay, and admittedly submitted my application at 11:58 P.M. All my essays were perfectly at the word limit, which doesn't mean jack sh\*t but yeah.

Some parts I could've improved were my SATs and my submission time; I definitely could've spent more time grinding out practice tests to aim for a 1600, and while it's said to not have an effect on college decisions my submission time was probably a bit too close to the deadline.

Again, I'm not here to brag.

And now my results.

Out of the 21 schools I applied to, I was accepted to three and wait-listed/rejected by the rest. Yes, I applied to Ivy league and so-called "T20" schools. I got into one Ivy league school (No, not HYP) and two other very awesome STEM-focused schools who were kind enough to give me a smile of acceptance.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, here's my message to the fellow future STEM international applicants.

* The whole admissions process is "unfair" and biased in countless ways. Why? I'll explain in the following bullet points. But I guess that's just how life is.
* Asian + Male + STEM, especially CS, ME, or AE = You're going to have a very hard time.Yes, being female will increase your chances of getting into a better school; this is very clear from admission stats. I'm not trying to undermine the accomplishments of the accepted female students and saying that they've achieved less than their male counterparts; I'm saying that with the same/similar level of stats, most colleges will probably choose the female applicant. I'm also implying that yes, the "each and every person is special!" is BS.
* Contrary to popular belief, yield protection does exist.
* This is probably well-known already, but international students need to achieve WAY higher than the average student in America to obtain similar results, i.e., "We consider each application without regards to race and ethnicity" is obviously BS.If this was actually true, American colleges would be flooded with international students, particularly from China and India, but in that case, where would domestic students go?In other words, the international applicants from competitive backgrounds are most likely VERY, VERY smart. One person I know who goes to MIT is a math genius; not just the "typical international math Olympics gold medalist," I'm talking Von Neumann-level of genius. Dude literally solved the hardest problem on the math Olympiad in under 15 seconds.That's the competition you're (or rather, us international students are/were) going up against. And one thing that tends to go unseen is that it's VERY, VERY difficult to even do an extracurricular in most Asian countries, whereas in America opportunities are abundant and handed out to students who want to participate in them.Colleges need to have "diversity" in their student body; they can't just admit every qualified international applicant (Which, in my opinion, is fair. Every country has colleges international students can go to, and American colleges are technically for American students in the first place). Your race/ethnicity/family income are all (uncontrollable) factors in your college application. Even if you're super good at what you do, if there are tons of others with the same conditions then you'll have a less chance of getting in compared to somebody who has "achieved less" but has unique uncontrollable characteristics. Accomplishment itself is a very relative factor.This is one reason why you shouldn't feel disappointed in yourself when you don't get accepted to a certain school; you were qualified-perhaps even more qualified than a portion of the admitted students-but you were waitlisted/rejected because of something you can't control. At my school, I hate to admit that around 70% of the people here aren't the shiny, omnipotent Ivy league students people think they are.
* As a STEM student, you aren't only judged by how smart you are. As in, you can't just be good at the technical stuff, unless you're so good that you're number one in the world and nothing else matters, even your grades and SAT. You must create an image of yourself where you're also good at things like PRing and the humanities, your "compassion and care for others" in your application in some way. I believe this holds true for the future, when we apply for jobs/positions too.This does go against the traditional  "follow your true passions" BS, but like explained in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/fqo68j/aos_cant_actually_detect_authenticity_or_passion/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), most applicants are doing their extracurriculars for the application, not their passion.
* This follows from the previous point, but if you want to get into a good school you are most likely better off pursuing something that sounds good on an application than your true passions.This is the reality.In my case, I was lucky enough to have my real passions work out for me at the end. I've continued my research in college, and things are working out quite well. But chances are most people won't be as lucky as I was.Sadly, you just can't write about your hobby of gardening unless you've obtained a really prestigious award which shows your "artistic skills."
* The vast majority of students from international countries who are applying as a STEM student and were accepted to HYPSM have an Olympic Medal or something close to that.No well-known international/national awards? You only have a slim chance of getting into T20s, and even if you do have a prestigious award, you still may not get in. In my case, everybody around me was shocked to learn that I didn't get into HYP. Again, I'm not trying to boast.
* Essays are very important for domestic students, not international students. Of course, there are outliers but in general your extracurriculars are what get you into T20 schools. But if you are willing to bet on that sliver of a chance where you're going to be that outlier, you're most likely in for a big disappointment. I'm not saying to give up and not try;  I'm saying to not aim too high and expect to prove reality wrong. Unless you're Einstein, it's probably not going to happen.

My point is, to all the Asian international male students who are looking to major in a field of engineering: I'm sorry, but most of you won't get into your top choices, especially if your top choices are Ivy League-level colleges if your extracurriculars aren't at a godly level. The chances of a Chinese or Indian student getting into an Ivy League school are just too low and too competitive.

From my personal experience and what I've heard from others, this is the harsh truth.

EDIT: This post is by any means not to discourage future applicants. However, such applicants should keep in mind the competition you're up against and expect the worst from your best results.
