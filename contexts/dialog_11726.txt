ANNIE: Oh, honey... What happened?
GRACE: Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
ANNIE: Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
GRACE: I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
ANNIE: Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
GRACE: Is that your version of a pep talk?
ANNIE: You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
GRACE: Fine!
ANNIE: It's still early. What's your next class?
