EMMETT: I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
DAWSON: Posse? What the hell you talking about?
EMMETT: My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue. Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.
DAWSON: You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
EMMETT: Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them... ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
