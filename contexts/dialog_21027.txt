O'BRIEN: Ain't it.
ARGON: As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
O'BRIEN: Oh no. You're not like me. In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
ARGON: It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
O'BRIEN: The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
POPPY: Icky!
SUSAN: Get him, Daniel! Knock his block off!
