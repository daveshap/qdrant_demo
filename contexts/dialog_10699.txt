ENID: I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.

ENID: That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?

ENID: Which loser?
REBECCA: You know, the green cardigan guy.
ENID: Oh yeah.
REBECCA: You call.
ENID: Why do I always have to do it?
REBECCA: You're better at it.
