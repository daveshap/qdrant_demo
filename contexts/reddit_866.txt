Anyone else anxious and scared about lockdown being lifted and having to attain responsibility and normality again?
I've never had much of an issue with being in quarantine, I liked being able to stay inside and watch television or listen to music all day. My country in now in talk to begin easing lockdown within a few weeks and I'm getting very nervous about having to go out and get a job and get back into the cycle where people need me to do things and have expectations of me etc
