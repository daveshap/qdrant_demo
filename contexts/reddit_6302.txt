Pre-employment screening asking about past employment, I don’t have proper records.
I’m applying for a job, they want employment history for the past 7years. I have my tax info from the last 10 years minus the years 2012 and 2013, they have been misplaced or lost. 

My tax guy is going to send me copies by today. However I think I may have mixed up some dates and need to add an additional employer to my record. I don’t know if I should be worried that this could jeopardize my potential employment or if it’s a minor fix through the verification company? Any advice would be welcome. Thanks
