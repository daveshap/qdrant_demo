MICKEY: What kind of pies do you have?
MABEL: Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
MICKEY: Which do you recommend?
MABEL: The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
MICKEY: I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
MABEL: When ya had it, did ya like it?
MICKEY: No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
