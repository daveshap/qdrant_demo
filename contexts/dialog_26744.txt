MIKE: How long do I wait to call?
TRENT: A day.
MIKE: Tomorrow?
TRENT: No...
SUE: ...Tomorrow, then a day.
TRENT: ...Yeah.
MIKE: So, two days?
TRENT: Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
SUE: Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
TRENT: ...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
SUE: ...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
TRENT: Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
MIKE: Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
CHARLES: ...then ask where you met her...
MIKE: Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like. Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that the money"?"
TRENT: Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
SUE: Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
