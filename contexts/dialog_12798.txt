HARTMAN: That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
MAYOR: We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
MAYOR: Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
HARTMAN: Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
MAYOR: I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
HARTMAN: But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
