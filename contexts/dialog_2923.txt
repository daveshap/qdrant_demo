CATHERINE: You won't believe me.
NICK: Try me.
CATHERINE: I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
NICK: When?
CATHERINE: About three months before I met you.
NICK: Why?
CATHERINE: I'd read about your shootings in the papers. I decided to write a book about a detective. I wanted to know my character.
NICK: You paid $50,000 for your character?
CATHERINE: I would've paid more. I wanted to know everything about you. Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
NICK: What about the other night. What about last night? Was that to get to know your character?
CATHERINE: Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
CATHERINE: Do you believe me?
NICK: I don't know.
CATHERINE: I'll convince you.
