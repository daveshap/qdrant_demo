PETER: There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
REGGIE: There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
PETER: What?
REGGIE: A quarter of a million dollars.
PETER: Go on.
REGGIE: That's all.
PETER: No, it isn't -- where's the money?
REGGIE: I don't know. Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
PETER: So they think he left it with you.
REGGIE: But he didn't! I've looked everywhere -- And if I don't find it -- Those men going to kill me.
PETER: No, they won't -- I won't let them.
REGGIE: Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
PETER: Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
REGGIE: I'm so hungry I could faint. I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
PETER: That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
REGGIE: Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
PETER: Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
REGGIE: Do you tell lies?
