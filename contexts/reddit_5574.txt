Applying to a position I'm not qualified for?
Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

Basically I've found a local company that is looking for someone that does, basically, graphic design. I've been looking to make a career move recently but have floundered in my current frustrations (and being swamped with current work).

&#x200B;

I'm an artist with a focus more in illustration than in web graphics, and I know Photoshop and basic Illustrator. This position doesn't list specific program knowledge, but they certainly use AfterEffects (which I have no knowledge of) and WordPress (also not knowledgeable). The best thing I feel I have going for me is that I really love what I have seen of their   company culture and feel like I'd be a good fit. I've also been an artist my entire life, professionally freelanced for a few years, and have a pretty good understanding of basic design principles (no degree, which they list as a requirement).

&#x200B;

But, I don't want to be one of those horror stories- the "We hired someone a few months back who got the spot \*\*somehow\*\*, but she really is clueless" - and put myself in an unstable position as a result. Alternatively, this could be a way into a career I finally feel passionate about (sorry, customer service, I don't think you're it anymore), and the company works a lot with local businesses, which I care about more than I thought I would.

&#x200B;

Should I wait it out, or should I try to apply? Do I come out forthright in my cover letter that I know I don't know all the programs they use, but I can learn?
