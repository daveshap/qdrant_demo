My Harvard interviewer just told me if it was up to her I would get into Harvard rn ğŸ¤¡
She really hyped me up by telling me that I interviewed really well, was quirky/unique and had a mature perspective most high schoolers do not. (thx lady!)

fml because she got me really excited ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ and it's fricking HARVARD so I know I'm gonna get rejected smh

and the interview doesn't mean a whole lot. rip.
