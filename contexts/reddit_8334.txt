Is there any legal precedence for/against a private company's speech being punished by the Government for editorializing content?
According to [multiple](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-trump-executive-order-social/trump-executive-order-takes-aim-at-social-media-firms-draft-idUSKBN2340MW) [sources](https://www.washingtonpost.com./technology/2020/05/27/trump-twitter-executive-order), President Trump will sign an executive order today that will attempt to change some protections that social media companies are given under [Section 230](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230).  This comes after Twitter added a short fact-check to [his tweet about mail-in ballots](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255835124539392).  The draft of the EO ([available here](https://kateklonick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DRAFT-EO-Preventing-Online-Censorship.pdf)), under Section 4, cites two SCOTUS cases ([Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruneyard_Shopping_Center_v._Robins) and [Packingham v. North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packingham_v._North_Carolina)) as precedence.

What other, if any, legal precedence exists to support/rebut the President's Executive Order?
