A year ago quit my job and posted to this subreddit [{LINK}](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsbotheringyou/comments/3fnnfu/what_my_coworkers_dont_know/)

To appropriately conclude the last year, it went great. Quitting my job was the best decision. The company changed swiftly in the next six months and had high turnover. It would've been chaotic had I stayed.

I found a job not too long after quitting. It was a contract that paid me 257% more and I had more room to grow and step up.

What I'm doing now is my own seo company and other cool projects. Oh and I married a wonderful friend.

All in all, I 100% encourage others to summon the bravery in times of uncertainty. When all seems lost remain calm and reason the path into existence. 

Tl;Dr
1. I Quit My Job
2. Acquired New Job with 257% raise
3. Live by words "Don't Panic"
