Can I add students on Facebook after the semester is over?
I am a TA for an undergrad course in Biology. A few of my students and I have become what I consider close friends. They’ve talked with me about hanging out after the semester is over. 

The students I want to friend are a few years older than me. Is this acceptable behavior? Would it come off as weird? They’re both graduating this semester so there isn’t a chance that I would have them as students again.
