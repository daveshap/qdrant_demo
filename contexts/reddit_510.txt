Silly, but I could use some social skills help
Basically here is some information you'll need to know:
- I'm super outgoing, I can get along with everyone(my age or like just a teen or something?)
- I have terrible social anxiety when it comes to adults the monotone in people's voice just freaks me out and it's unsettling to just hold a conversation

Knowing those things, we move onto the actual problem
I like this boy, he's not the best at social skills and he mainly conveys his conversations with memes and jokes. But when he is genuinely seriously he can have a pretty serious conversation, and he is so smart on so many things. And I want to talk to him, I want to ask him so many questions but I get such a block. And I feel like it's because of his mental illness, no its not that I'm unable to look past it or something before someone says it lol. I love and care about every piece of him, but no feel like no topic is good enough to catch his attention or will not make him freak. I just don't know what to do, what to ask, how to learn about him!

I sincerely just want to ask him things that he won't find stupid and small, I want a serious conversation something that can drive us closer or something. I'm trying to see if I can somehow get him alone in person? Maybe he's just a bad texter idk but I'm just super anxious. Ã€ny opinions?
(Thank you for reading lmao)
