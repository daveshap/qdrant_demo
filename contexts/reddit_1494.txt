I feel so lonely right now that it’s brought me to tears
I’m laying down in bed and for the moment there’s no one to talk to or hang out with and I’m so incredibly overwhelmed with anxiety that I would hug the shit out of the first person I saw. 

Edit: Wait my ribs are actually crushed from so many peeps virtually hugging me at once. So thankful for each piece of encouragement, much love to y’all. Wow.
