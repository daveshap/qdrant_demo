If I kill myself my mom will be absolutely devastated.
That's really the only thing keeping me here. I woke up depressed (as usual) and found a package with my name on it. My mom had got me a pair of earrings for Valentine's Day along with a card telling me how much I mean to her. Instead of making me happy, it made me really sad. I don't deserve this.
