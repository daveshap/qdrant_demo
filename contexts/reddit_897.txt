Does anyone else get gastrointestinal issues when they are very anxious?
I get gassy, crampy, and sometimes full on runs just from being anxious. My stomach will hurt and occasionally I'll get heartburn. Only when I'm highly anxious.

I just wondered if anyone else gets this and can't think of anywhere I'd be more comfortable asking....

Edit - wow, this blew up. I had no idea this was such a common thing!
