PAUL: What's so urgent? You've got me worried.
LETTY: I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
PAUL: You can tell me anything. Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
LETTY: No...
PAUL: That's a load off my mind.
PAUL: You what?
LETTY: I don't mean to hurt you. I know this is a terrible thing. And I have really loved you.
PAUL: Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
LETTY: I've met someone else.
PAUL: Who?
LETTY: It doesn't matter who.
PAUL: Have you been seeing another teacher?
LETTY: No.
PAUL: It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
LETTY: He's a patient here.
PAUL: Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
LETTY: I love him.
PAUL: You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
LETTY: Here's the ring.
PAUL: No way. You keep the ring. You'll come to your senses.
