TED: Ask Simon.
ELAINE: Ted, you're overworked. You've been flying yourself into the ground.
TED: There's nothing wrong with me!
ELAINE: Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
TED: You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine! It's all here in the design specifications! Look! It's all here!
