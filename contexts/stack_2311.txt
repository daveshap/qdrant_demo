What does each Esper unlock on each board? In Final Fantasy XII Zodiac Age, each character can select 2 boards (or classes). Some of these classes have unique spells or nodes that can unlock based on which Espers are unlocked for that board. But only 1 Esper can be unlocked and then it is gone.I want to spread out my Esper unlocks and not dump them all onto 1 character, but I also want to unlock certain things to balance out my party. I just don't know what unlocks what.So my question is: What does each Esper unlock on each board?
