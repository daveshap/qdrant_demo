RUDY: All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
NICK: Thought you hated Sidnaw.
RUDY: Just taste that Christmas turkey.
NICK: Thought you hate your old man.
RUDY: Five years, Nicky. Five years. I just want to go home.
