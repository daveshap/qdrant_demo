BUD: Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
GEKKO: Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
BUD: Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly... ...about 50 thousand.
GEKKO: I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
BUD: What? How do you know about my father?
GEKKO: The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
BUD: Yes...
