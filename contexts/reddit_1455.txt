I get why people with mental health problems don't tell others about
You'll just get gas-lighted with every issue you have with others and it would be made to seem like you're the one with the problem. It's a bittersweet ordeal because the accusers are always trying to be so "above it all" and pretend to be some sort of arm chair therapist, telling you to get help. I have anxiety, trust and believe when I say I don't go up attacking people. There's a lot of instances where I don't even talk with people at all.
