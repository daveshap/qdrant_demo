How do I make macOS properly blacken my TV screen on standby I have a Mac Mini connected to a Sony W755C TV by HDMI. If I put \"Set display to sleep\" on the Mac, the TV goes to black but displaying a very unsightly OSD text \"HDMI 1 (Clock) No input. Check your cables, etc.\" which stays on forever, until I power the TV off manually. I can't find any menu items in the TV to remove the OSD, which just looks ugly on the huge TV in my living room.So I tried to use the TV's own \"standby if inactive for n hours\but \"inactive\" for the TV means not fiddling with the remote, which I only use for ON/OFF. The TV is oblivious to what's going on on the Mac. So it will suddenly suggest to sleep in the midst of a movie, which is obviously annoying.Is there any way I can make the TV either a) go to standby modus without any OSD text, or b) soft-power off (same as pressing OFF on the remote -- which is not full power off, mind you...)
