JISM JIM: Hey man.
JAKE: We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
JISM JIM: I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
JAKE: That's not true, Mr...?
JISM JIM: Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
JAKE: That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
JISM JIM: Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
JAKE: That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
