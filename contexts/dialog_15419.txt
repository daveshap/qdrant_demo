FRANK: Did you see his face?
KATHY: No. He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist. It was Peter.
FRANK: I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist. Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
KATHY: I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
FRANK: Okay. Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
