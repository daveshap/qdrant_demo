Male-Female Double Standard re: rejections
If a girl rejects a guy, it is because he is lacking in intelligence, attractiveness, moral values, earning potential, etc., and is overall just not good enough. If a guy reject a girl, his standard are too high re: intelligence, attractiveness, moral values, earning potential, etc., and just fails to see how good she is.

Friends are telling me to lower my standards (re: intelligence, success, moral values, and earning potential) but women on the other hand are valued and respected for having those standards.
Sorry. Just needed to rant!
