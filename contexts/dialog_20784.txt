JUDGE GARNETT: In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
JOE: With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
JUDGE GARNETT: No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
