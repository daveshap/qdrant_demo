Policy Successes of Black Lives Matter Organization
**EDIT:** While I appreciate all of your answers to this question, I see now I was not clear in my distinction between the Black Lives Matter movement, and Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., whose website I linked. In my questions below, and in my title of this post, when I reference the "Black Lives Matter organization" (which I admit is a misnomer, though I'll leave the questions unedited for transparency), I mean specifically Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., and I'm curious about what they've accomplished with respect to policy. I take full responsibility for the confusion, and I apologize.

In the wake of [George Floyd's death](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/30/video-timeline-george-floyd-death/), the phrase "Black Lives Matter" has been a part of [celebrity social media posts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/06/11/celebrities-black-lives-matter-movement/), [official corporate communications](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/13/after-years-marginalizing-black-employees-customers-corporate-america-says-black-lives-matter/), and [art on the streets of a few US cities](https://dcist.com/story/20/06/12/the-standoff-over-d-c-s-black-lives-matter-mural-illustrated/).

Likewise, donations to groups that focus on combating issues around racial prejudice and race-based inequities have reportedly skyrocketed. Specifically, according to [this article](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/06/14/us/politics/black-lives-matter-racism-donations.html) in the New York Times: 

> "ActBlue, the leading site to process online donations for Democratic

> ticker."

That being said, some organizations are more forthcoming about what their funds are responsible for than others. For example, [the NAACP's organizational history page](https://www.naacp.org/nations-premier-civil-rights-organization/) describes their involvement in the processes of the "integration of the armed forces in 1948 but also passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1964, and 1968 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965."

The Black Lives Matter website, however, gives far less information than those of comparable organizations. The group's pages within their "About" section dedicated to their history as an organization (namely the "[About Black Lives Matter,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/)" "[6 Years Strong,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/six-years-strong/)" and "[Herstory,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/herstory/)" pages) all mention the group's formation in 2013-2014, but they don't mention any other significant dates important to the group, or policy successes that the group was responsible for. The only place on the website which does list significant dates and initiatives seems to be the site's [Global Actions page](https://blacklivesmatter.com/global-actions/), which as of posting has not been updated beyond February 2019 (here is a link to the Wayback Machine's [snapshot of this page c. June 13, 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200613093333/https://blacklivesmatter.com/global-actions/) for posterity).

This leads me to wonder:

1) Has the Black Lives Matter organization been responsible for changes in policy at the local, state, or federal level in pursuance of their mission?

2 ) If so, what are those changes, and is there any evidence that they have successfully brought the locality, state, or country wherein they were enacted closer to the organization's vision?
