Fiancée has anxiety during long car rides. How to have a not anxious fiancée. A 6 step process
Step 1: Turn the air-con to minimum temp, which is 50 for us. Turn on recirculation to cool it faster. 

Step 2: Load tank top and shorts wearing fiancée into back seat. Buckle aforementioned fiancée in. Wait for hypothermia to start to set in (just kidding, just enough to be a lil cold) 

Step 3: Lean seat back, put blankets over fiancée. 

Step 4: Adjust neck pillow on fiancées neck,  give iPod (which is plugged into car) and put on Spotify. Place earbuds in her ears, adjust volume to a comfortable level. 

Step 5: Drive for comfort, expect her to fall asleep as soon as we get on the highway. Bring air up to 68F and turn off recirculation. 

Step 6: Awake fiancée on arrival to destination.
