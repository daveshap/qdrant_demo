Using a GLM repeated measures in r to determine at what day do organisms raised at different temperatures become significantly different in weight? So I conducted an experiment that looked at the effect that a range of temperatures had on the weight of shellfish. There are 7 temperature treatments, each temperature is 1 tank (no replicates, I know its a problem). I took samples twice a week for 1 month (each sample was destructive and approximately 20 randomly sampled organisms). I am trying to find at what sampling day did the changes between treatments become statistically different from each other. My thought is to use a repeated measures general linearized model to test day against size with pH as a fixed factor that interacts with day. so this is what my r code looks like:glm(weight ~ Day + Temp + Day*Temp, data = Temp1Does this make sense for what I am trying to do?
