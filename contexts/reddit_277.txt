How can I (18M) approach girls?
I live on a college campus and I'm in my sophomore year. I see girls all the time in my class and I go to the female dormitory from 5:30 pm to 8:00 pm in order to keep a female friend of mine company at the secretary's desk. Besides the typical greeting with girls leaving in and out of the dorm while I'm there and the interaction with my friend, I have no idea  on how to approach girls or how to talk to them. Any advice to help me would be greatly appreciated.
