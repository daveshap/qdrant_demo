Job for a young disabled model?
Hello people of reddit,
I'm a 22 year old disabled young woman. It's a really long story and I don't want to bore everyone with trivial knowledge of my past. So the gist of my story is that I missed almost all of high school due to being very ill and hospitalized (I was given a month to live). I was told to not to go back to school because of how sick I was at the time but I did go back and got 24 credits in 10 months and got my high school diploma. After that I attempted to go to a local College but it was a terrible experience and I was yelled at by professors for being so disabled and when I tried to take a medical withdrawal they did not reimburse my money. I cannot use my right arm at all even though I used to be right handed I can use my left hand type but cannot write. I used to have dreams of becoming a forensic psychologist before I got sick but that takes years of post secondary education. I am currently unable to go to post-secondary education due to lack of funds and I cannot get a job due to my disabilities and so I have no way of saving money. My interests have always been either forensic psychology or history related. Before I got sick I was at a runway model because my mother was living out her childhood dreams vicariously through me. I never really liked modelling because I have always tended to be more scientific minded and despise the idea of fashion and all that. But I cannot even pursue Runway modelling anymore. Due to my disabilities, I can't walk in heels anymore.

TLDR Basically I'm a 22 year-old disabled ex model just looking to find a passion in life because right now my life seems like it's lacking purpose.

Any advice that anyone could give would be greatly appreciated :)
