CARLOS: You like the car?
SETH: I said new, this is an '90.
CARLOS: It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
SETH: So do I just follow you?
CARLOS: Yeah, follow us.
SETH: So let's do it.
CARLOS: Vamanos!
SETH: I'm sorry.
KATE: Me too.
SETH: See ya.
KATE: Later.
