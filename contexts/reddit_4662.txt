I feel nothing
My brother's murderer was brought to justice yesterday and was found guilty. The initial relief that washed over me left me feeling ecstatic. Now it has worn away, along with the trial anxiety, and I am left feeling nothing. This is the biggest nothing I have ever felt in my entire life. I keep dissociating for hours on end and it is the most bizarre thing. I really just need to know that I am going to be okay.
