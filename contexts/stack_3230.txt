Audio series about a kid that goes by X I am trying to find an audio series that we listened to in elementary school ('94 to be exact). From what I remember, it was narrated by a girl, but the character she portrayed (X) could wake up on any day and be an entirely different person. She would live life as this other kid, male or female, for an undetermined amount of time until she would again wake as another person. I cannot for the life of me find anything close to this on Google. Thanks!
