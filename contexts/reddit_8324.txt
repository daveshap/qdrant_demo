What is the legality of the confinement of Gen. John Baker at Guantanamo Bay?
Today, Colonel Vance Spath (USAF) [ordered](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article182031196.html) that General John Baker (USMC) be confined to quarters for 21 days as punishment for contempt of a military commission.  

This resulted from three lawyers for the defendant in the USS Cole case [resigning after an ethical conflict that is at least partially classified, but involved the government listening in on attorney-client privileged communications.](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article178691836.html)

Gen. Baker is the chief defense counsel, and allowed the dismissal of the three civilian lawyers.  Col. Spath is the judge and objected, ordering that only he could allow their dismissal and that he did not allow it.

Gen. Baker refused to withdraw his opinion and was ordered confined for 21 days for contempt.

What is the legality of this detention?  Gen. Baker argued in the hearing before being cut off that the commission did not have jurisdiction over him as he was a US citizen.  Is that correct, and does it preclude Col. Spath's actions?  

Is there another provision of law that would apply?  Does it matter that Col. Spath and Gen. Baker are in different service branches, or that Gen. Baker outranks Col. Spath?
