SUPERVISOR: How'd you get in here.
WILSON: Walked.
SUPERVISOR: You walked. What the hell are you doing here.
WILSON: Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
SUPERVISOR: He's expecting you?
WILSON: I doubt it.
SUPERVISOR: So why would he want to see you.
WILSON: I have a message for him. About Jennifer Wilson.
SUPERVISOR: Jennifer Wilson.
WILSON: You know her?
SUPERVISOR: Yeah. I know her, all right. She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule. If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw. 'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
WILSON: Is Valentine here?
SUPERVISOR: What do you think?
WILSON: Where is he, then?
SUPERVISOR: Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt. Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
