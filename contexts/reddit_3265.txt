How can I pick a career and start over?
I'm a 27 year old female, and I never had a full time job partly because I have been struggling with depression, and partly because I lack marketable skills. Although I have disadvantage I would be happy if I could find my career because it would be sad to spend the rest of my life doing menial labor... I would like to learn skills and get a job, but I don't have idea what I want and can do. I have a B.A. in law, and I speak Japanese (native language), English, and Spanish. I thought about web design, but working condition of the industry is harsh in my country, which is not good for my depression at all. Somehow I thought about pharmacy but 6 years is too long at my age. I'm really at a loss, and I would appreciate if you could give me some advice.
