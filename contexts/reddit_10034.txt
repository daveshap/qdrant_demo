Is it safe to only apply to out of state graduate programs?
Hey everyone!

I am currently a senior and am looking forward to attending a student affairs graduate program in Fall 2014. I've spent all my life in Texas and I really want change. I've spent lots of times researching, emailing, and calling various universities to apply to and I am only applying to five programs, all of which are outside of Texas. I love them because not only are they awesome programs, they will also be providing me with a tuition waiver if I get an assistantship.

Anyways, is it safe to do that? Am I at some sort of disadvantage by only applying out of state? Or is me being out of state treated the same as the in state applicants?
