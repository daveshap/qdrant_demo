Google My Maps importing gpx files I am able to successfully import gpx data to Google My Maps. Most of the gpx files I have imported are in English and I am able to move them into same layer. However, some gpx files are in another language and they can't be placed on the same layer as the English ones. Are there some tricks or tools to convert the gpx file to same format as the others?
