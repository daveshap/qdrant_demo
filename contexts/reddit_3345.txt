Movie, then dinner. Not dinner and a movie.
Everyone always says "dinner and a movie" but that's not a good plan, especially if neither of you are good at starting conversation. 

Think about it. You go to dinner, have awkward conversation over a meal, then sit quietly in a movie before going home.

Go to the movie first, and you have an immediate icebreaker. The movie. Get conversation going, and it's easier to jump into the about you kinda stuff. Not only that, but the last thing your date will remember is the fun conversation and good meal you just had.

Thank you for coming to my talk.

EDIT: So I see a lot of reasons why dinner and a movie are a bad thing, mainly "You can't get to know each other during the movie," but in part that's the point.

Talking to people is a skill, and not everyone is good at it. To everyone suggesting this where it is you, the other person, and basically nothing else, I think you're missing this point. The movie first is meant to give you an entire movie with of things you can talk about to get the conversation started.

For the people saying "dinner first, in case they're a creep so you can leave" you can leave during a movie too. But awkwardness in conversation can be taken as creepy even if it's just a lack of knowledge on how to have a conversation.

To those saying I forgot the word "Ted" I know :p it was on purpose.
