PAMELA: Alright... take it down.
CRONIN: What?
PAMELA: This stays between you and I. We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
ABBOTT: You told me Bourne was dead.
GRETKOV: There was a mistake.
ABBOTT: I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
GRETKOV: Will it track back to us?
ABBOTT: No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
GRETKOV: And the Landy woman?
ABBOTT: She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
GRETKOV: Anything else?
