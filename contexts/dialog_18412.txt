TAYLOR: Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
HUBERT: Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
TAYLOR: Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
HUBERT: Me! Jim--how--?
TAYLOR: You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
HUBERT: Y-yes, Jim.
TAYLOR: I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
