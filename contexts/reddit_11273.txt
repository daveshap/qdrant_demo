I want to move out so fucking bad
I'm currently 23 and still living with my dad. Lately he has been driving me crazy and I would do anything to just get away from him. He babies me like crazy, calling me at work everyday to see what time im done so he can pick me up and give me a ride home(I don't have a car yet so I primarily take the Bus to work and home). He makes me dinner every night and its starting to irritate me. I have to help him with every technological problem there is no matter how simple the fix is. He is constantly barging into my room acting and talking in the most annoying way possible. He is an alcoholic and having to deal with him when he is drunk makes me want to gouge my eyes out. I'm currently working on finding a better paying job so that I can one day move out but until then I have to just suffer for as long as it takes for me to move out.
