My nephew just went to the hospital.
My nephew, nicknamed Gator, just went to the hospital today. For the past few months he's been losing a crazy amount of weight. He's been going to the doctor and getting tests regularly, but they can't find what's wrong with him.

Yesterday, they got the results back of his most recent blood test. They said that it was very inconsistent with his last and he needed to see a specialist in Hershey Medical Center. Now, in this part of the state, if you have to go to Hershey, it's a big deal. They were trying to get him an appointment and all they had was today or the 28th of next month. The doctor told my sister if they waited that long, he might not make it. :'(

So, his appointment was at 11. We haven't gotten word back yet as to what's going on or anything. I'm freaking out. He's 7 years old and down to 38 pounds. He's like a walking skeleton. What used to be an active (almost TOO hyper) boy, is now a half corpse laying around not even eating.

What kind of perplexes me, is that his blood is showing something wrong. Why is he going to a gastroenterologist? I get he's not eating, but I think it's a symptom and not part of the diagnoses. Then again, I'm not a doctor. My first thought was leukemia. And at this point, I'd be happy to know what's wrong.

Just worried sick right now. :(
