CORRADO: Well?
CLAUDIA: Well, what?
CORRADO: Have you decided?
CLAUDIA: All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
GIULIA: Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
CORRADO: Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea
CORRADO: But Corrado... If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
GIULIA: He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
CORRADO: Giulia, that remark is not worthy of our twelve years of honest concubinage. I repeat, once and for all, and publicly, that I admire you. Does that please you?
CLAUDIA: Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
SANDRO: And why haven't they left each other?
CLAUDIA: I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
SANDRO: Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
GIULIA: The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
SANDRO: Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
GIULIA: You men are all so dreadful!
SANDRO: I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
