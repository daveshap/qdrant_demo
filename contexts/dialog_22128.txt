MR. WHITE: Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.
MR. ORANGE: You could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. He talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.
EDDIE: I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
MR. WHITE: It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
MR. PINK: He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
EDDIE: Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
