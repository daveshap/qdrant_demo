SEBASTIAN: What are the terms?
KATHRYN: If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
SEBASTIAN: And if I win?
KATHRYN: I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
SEBASTIAN: Be more specific.
KATHRYN: In English. I'll fuck your brains out.
SEBASTIAN: What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
KATHRYN: Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
