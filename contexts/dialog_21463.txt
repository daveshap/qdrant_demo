HUMPERDINCK: There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
RUGEN: Who won? How did it end?
HUMPERDINCK: The loser ran off alone. The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
RUGEN: Shall we track them both?
HUMPERDINCK: The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters -- -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 42.
RUGEN: Could this be a trap?
HUMPERDINCK: I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
