How do you succeed in business as a shy/introverted person?
So far the biggest thing holding me back in business is being shy. I can typically turn on the charm when I have to, like for a client or for an interview. But I’m more of a quiet reserved person. 

It doesn’t necessarily hold me back professionally, such as I still make and exceed my sales goals, I am very quick to learn new skills, I am patient and calm with clients and can turn around a bad situation by being nice and “sweet”

But it does hold me back in the social aspect of my business life. Some example of this are I have trouble networking and making connections. I don’t make friends easily at the office (6 months in I’m loved by everyone, but up until then I get a lot of heat. They don’t understand why the quiet girl is doing so well and the loud people are just doing ok). I once had a boss call a meeting with me just tell me the thing she hated about me most was that I was shy. I asked her if she thought I wasn’t doing my work well, she said it was all great but she didn’t like that I wasn’t loud and chatty like her. I could understand if a client said something, but I didn’t work with clients at that point, I did research for her. 

I learn by listening and observing, then trying and then asking questions along the way. I’ve had employers tell me that if I’m not asking questions while learning, I’m not paying attention. So then I end up thinking of questions I don’t really need to ask just to appease them by asking *something* and they point this out as a negative also. 

I don’t know how to succeed in business as a shy person in a field that is run and dominated by extroverted people. All answered are greatly appreciated!
