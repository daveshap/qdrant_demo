How do people just..meet other people?
So its as the title says, I(27M) have no idea how people just meet other people so easily. Like is it location? Is there something I'm too dense to get? 

I hear about all these success cases around me for both online and in person meetings all the time. Two of my best friends found their current partners through online services, and quickly at that. So maybe its that online profile wise, I'm boring or unattractive? Could be my crippling phobia of talking to someone I've never personally met before but hard to tell.

In person too though, I work customer service, I see people ALL the time. Sure, I'm not particularly looking for a match while I'm working, but even when I'm just out and about (quarantine not withstanding) I don't just happen upon others like I always hear about. So I'm more curious during this time of isolation (I work customer service though so It's not so much isolation for me), what sets those who can just meet people apart from others?
