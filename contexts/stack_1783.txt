High pass filter for electret mic to mobile phone I\u2019m currently working on making a lavalier microphone for use with my phone and gopro camera. I know these types of microphones are readily available and can be purchased fairly cheap, but where would be the fun in that? I\u2019ve purchased lavalier mics in the past and dissected and realized that they connect the electret microphone straight to the trrs jack using the 2-3v supplied by the mobile device or camera to power the microphone.  I\u2019m trying to do the same but between the ECM and the TRRS I want to add a high pass filter. I attempted to try this on breadboard and there is no signal coming through with a high pass filter of 97 Hz.  Using a 170 ohm resister and 10uf capacitor. I have done some research and I cannot find anything that pertains to my exact predicament.  What I did, Electret mic + to 10uf cap then to trrs but between the Cap and TRRS I put a 170 ohm resister to the ground wire.The - side of mic I connected straight to ground on trrs with the 170 ohm resistor connecting to it. Here is a horribly drawn illustration of how I wired the mic. EDIT!!!!!!! Guys take a look at this circuit now and see if it\u2019s better.
