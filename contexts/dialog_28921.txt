ROSE: So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
JACK: Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
ROSE: A whole ten cents?!
JACK: Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
ROSE: Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
JACK: Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
ROSE: You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
JACK: Sure. If you like.
ROSE: I think I would. And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
JACK: They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
