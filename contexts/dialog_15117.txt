BILLER: Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches... We can do some great logging up here.
JANET: Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
BILLER: I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
BILLER: Jesus Christ!
JANET: Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
BILLER: Get rid of them.
