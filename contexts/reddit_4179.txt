Asked her out.
I’m a pretty shy person when it comes with ladies. But I finally asked a girl to the movies that I’ve been wanting to go with for a long time. She’s a barista. So as I went from doing errands I grabbed some dinner at at store. And there’s a Starbucks kiosk in the store. I got my coffee after my groceries. I didn’t even think or expected her to be there that day, but she was. I ordered my coffee and as I waited we talked. Just as she gave me my coffee I asked if she saw avengers. She said she did but really wanted to see it again. I then asked if I could take you to se it? She said YES!!. Gave her my number and said bye then left. I had a tiny boost of confidence and used it to my advantage. Thought y’all like to hear a good story. 
Thanks
