I can see the bubbles breaking the water's surface
I got a bonus for getting a guy hired here a few months ago and threw it on a debt from my divorce. It put the payoff in reach in ways I hadn't dared dream.

Thanks to some hustles and side gigs and eBay auctions, I just paid it off this morning. Now, my biggest monthly (debt-related) bill is dead and I can actually start my debt snowball for real.

My head is about to break the surface, y'all. I'm about to take a big, big breath.
