SUSAN: In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
THOMPSON: The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
SUSAN: They haven't been tough on me. I just lost my money. But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
THOMPSON: I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
SUSAN: Don't you think I do? You say you're going down to Xanadu?
THOMPSON: Monday, with some of the boys from the office. Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff. We run a picture magazine, you know -
SUSAN: I know. If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond. That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him. He knows where the bodies are buried.
