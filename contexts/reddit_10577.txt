It's So Hard to Find Meaning After Rock Bottom...
In the last 6 years I lost my mother to a sudden illness (amyloidosis) married the love of my life, found a successful career with a sweet company car, bought a house, succumbed to alcoholism, attempted suicide, lost my father to alcoholic dementia, lost my my wife, car, house and my job.  I was sober for about 8 months but have been struggling for the last 4 months, jobless in a town without anyone but my 97 year old grandmother.  

I've been hiding my relapse from everyone.  

I flipped out on a friend on Facebook and said something that really turned the knife in me.  He spewed off all his accomplishments -- owner of two companies, wife and 4 kids, head of three community boards, two houses and then said, "And what about you?  Are you even recovered?"

But honestly, what does all those things even mean?  Do they matter?  Do I matter?  Does it really matter to anyone if I recover?  The stigma is so terrible with addiction that the first thing he went for was that.  He was right, but that just reinforces that addicts are the scum of the earth, and I'm one of them.

So is it really worth it?  We're on an over populated planet with people fighting for their piece of the pie.  Do I deserve anything?
