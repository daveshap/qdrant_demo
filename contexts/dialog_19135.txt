NURSE: Mr. Green?
GREEN: Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
NURSE: Didn't you get?... How are you?
GREEN: I'm fine. Can I go up?
NURSE: Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
GREEN: You want me to wait?
NURSE: No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
GREEN: What?
NURSE: Your wire Ester - she passed away.
