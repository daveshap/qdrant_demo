DICKSON: We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
CLARK: What do you mean, help?
DICKSON: I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
CLARK: That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
DICKSON: I have everything I own in it. It's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
