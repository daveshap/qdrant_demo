CREASY: What am I doing here?
MANZANO: Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can. This page?
CREASY: No.
MANZANO: You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
CREASY: Am I a suspect?
MANZANO: No. It would be convenient, but no.
CREASY: Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
MANZANO: All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
