Post-Job application etiquette
I’m currently searching for a job out of state and found one that is my dream job. It puts my two passions together so perfectly. I’ve applied and sent everything in but now it’s waiting time. (I’m in my career job stage of my life but only a couple of years in) 

What is the post job app etiquette when it comes to calling them back or asking about opportunities later on if I hear I didn’t get it?
