Stats questions 

- Should I retake a 740 USH?  **It’s not related to my major** *no duh it’s not related to your major, you’re probably a STEM major like the other 70% of this sub*

- **stats don’t matter! I had a 3.6 UW and 1410 SAT and got into Harvard!!** (opens post, is a URM or did some selective program with some 5% acceptance rate)

- GUYS YOUR STATS AND ECS MATTER!!!

- my grades dropped freshmen year because I had depression, is an upward trend good? I suddenly cured my depression and “got my act back up” when sophomore year started and now I no longer have depression, (4.0 UW from then on)

- do stats matter?

- If I don’t do Quiz Bowl next year because of a time constraint, will I get rejected?

- Reverse chance me! 4.0 UW, 1600, Asian fe/male CS, California/Massachusetts, founded Hackathon, AP State Scholar, MITES, Olympiad, Research with prestigious professor, recommendation from professor at Princeton, likely/recruited letter from Stanford

- I screwed up one part of my application my life is over

- I was late to my interview, will that hurt my chances

- When applying to the school of animation and arts at Carnegie Mellon university, should I fill out part A or part B of form 246?  I’m a Latino/mix, but there’s no where to put that (Strangely specific application question that little to no one knows the answer to)

- guys are honors classes 4.5 or 5.0? (Question only your school knows the answer to)

- I have a 2.3 GPA because *insert some extenuating circumstance* and I am not applying to ivies because I am going to CC for two years and I feel the need to share this because this sub only has people with 34+

essays

- I haven’t started my essays should I be worried?

- GUYS YOUR ESSAYS MATTER!!!!!

- Is writing about your favorite sock a good idea? I can really talk about myself in that essay

- is writing about my scientific epiphany I reached as a 15 year old working at Stanford’s medical lab a good topic?

- random lost redditor asking about grad school admissions

Sample responses:

- it won’t be the reason you get rejected...but it certainly won’t help (wtf does this even mean)

- GUYs I REALLY WANT TO GO TO HYPSM!! (And I dream about it everyday) *so do the rest of the 32000 people applying*

- “u/williamthereader is a god” || “that’s what williamthereader said” || “I think he’s an AO from Yale?”

- yeah that ACT score is going to get you rejected (response to “I have a 33 SS, can I get into ivies”)

- doNT senD 670 phySics subject Test bC ITs A BAd ScOre

- doNT SEND 1430 to UCHICAGO bC itS a BaD ScOre

- I was also in your shoes...

- it depends...what college are you aiming for?

- guys community college is a good choice if you have lower than average stats!

- there are brilliant, hardworking individuals who attend community college

- *also this sub*: LmaO Community CollEge obviously (in response to a “strong” reverse chance me)

- in for Dartmouth, Cornell and Brown.  If you write good essays, you’ll probably get accepted into HYPSM (a response to a “strong” Reverse Chance MeH)

- ED is more competitive, has more qualified individuals, legacies, recruiter athletes, URMs

- I’ve seen someone with X, Y, Z stats get in so you should be fine :)
