STRIKER: Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
ELAINE: I remember everything. All I have are memories.
ELAINE: Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
STRIKER: That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
ELAINE: But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
