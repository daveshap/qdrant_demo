I’m in my 30s. I’ve never had a gf. I’m about to be a physician. Getting in a relationship earlier would have only decreased the odds of me getting here. Worth it.
I was a nontraditional student meaning I graduated with my bachelors degree, worked for a bank for a while, then went back to school to try to get into med school. I did and now I’m almost done with med school. Trying to get into med school was a weird idea for me before I got in. No one believed I could do it, not even me, but I worked my ass off for it anyway. I can only see a relationship holding me back from getting there in these circumstances. I think I would have been less of a risk taker and more realistic if I had been in a relationship. Which means no crazy med school dreams. So there’s really no reason to beat myself up about this. I should just move forward. I still honestly have all the time in the world.
