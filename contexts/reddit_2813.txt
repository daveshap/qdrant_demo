22F College Graduate and I still can’t find a job?

I’ve been really depressed after graduating from UC San Diego last June 2019. It’s been months and months of constant rejection. I’ve only get offered jobs from minimum wage jobs such as Target. I graduated with a bachelors in science in public health. I’m starting to realize my degree gets me no where. However, a few of my peers with the same degree has found a job related to health. I also have been applying to internships, yet I never get called to set up an interview. I have previous work experience at an office and I have plenty of volunteer experience. None of these has led me to any job entry positions. Am I doing something wrong? Is it my Resume? The way I type information onto online applications. My lack of skills? My degree? I’m just deeply depressed and I even moved back home in Northern California with my parents and they’re financially supporting me. This makes me feel completely guilty as I’m the first to graduate and I can’t get a job anywhere. Not even the public health department at different state counties will offer me an interview.

I’ve been super down and all of that sadness comes from moving back home with my parents, not having any friends at my hometown, and no money. 

Advice?
