What overall evidence supports or refutes that there's a relationship between the Trump administration and Russia?
Today, Eric Trump said:

[“If there was anything that Syria did, it was to validate the fact that there is no Russia tie,”] (http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/eric-trump-russia-syria-strikes-237102)

However, Trump's personal attorney also said today:

["At least there's a relationship that's been started between the president and President Putin...Now he can actually reach out to him and have a conversation with him that's not already predicated on tension.] (http://thehill.com/homenews/news/328227-trump-lawyer-defends-president-on-russia-at-least-theres-a-relationship)

For his part in February, Trump said:

["Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn't. I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago."] (http://www.npr.org/2017/02/16/515624391/nobody-that-i-know-of-trump-denies-campaign-contacts-with-russia)

So does the overall evidence support or refute that there is a Trump-Russia relationship?
