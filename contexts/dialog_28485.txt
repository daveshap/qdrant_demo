MIMI: What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
GILBERT: He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
MIMI: That woman!
GILBERT: She could tell you where father is.
DOROTHY: Mother .... you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
MIMI: I didn't say I would. But we've got to have money.
DOROTHY: Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
MIMI: Shush!
