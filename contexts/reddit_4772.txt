Life fucked me , I'm still 18
Having a rare condition called Bladder Exstrophy(if you could pee like normal people thank god for that because it's a grace not everyone has)
Sole Child
Never had gf( I'm straight)
No best friend
My hair is shedding and I start growing grey hairs
A combination of bad genetics: 
I'm overweight with a decent body fat percentage , I tried very harddddd training, eating healthy , cutting calories etc... . In order to maintain a good physique but in vein (slow metabolism).
173 cm in height.
Problems in teeth , back, legs.
Not the best looking face. 
Father was addicted to drugs in the past , so he did not take care of me (although he is fine now and he loved and still loves me)
Puberty hit me early , so I started growing a beard when I was 12 , so you can say I got bullied  in my life.
I have a fuckkking bad luck , alot of situations  occured to me proved that for me.
This is part of my problems , I'm struggling alot in life and trying to be happy, but now I have no energy to continue living life is a whole misrey. Help me
