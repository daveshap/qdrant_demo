My degree (worth $26,000 and two years time) is worthless apparently.
I have two associates degrees. I got them because all the jobs I was looking for a few years ago required an associates degree. 

Here I am, looking for a job 3 years later and now all the places I look require a bachelors. 

Fuck me. 

I even googled "entry level jobs highest paying" and 39 out of 40 of the top paying "ENTRY LEVEL" jobs are now requiring a bachelors degree. 

Fuck me x2. 

I'm 20 grand in debt for a worthless piece of paper. How the fuck am I supposed to keep my family fed and off the streets? 

I feel like a failure at life. What kind of man can't keep his family fed?
