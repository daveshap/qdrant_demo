So I met this girl . . .
Three weeks ago I matched with this girl on Tinder. We both played PC games so we started talking about that. As we chatted we found out we had some mutual friends. We had started chatting in the evening so she had to go to bed. But she messaged me again in the morning. We’ve been talking every day since.

We text in the morning and throughout the day and play video games, watch Haunting of Hill House on Netflix, and chat in the evenings. We spend hours video chatting every day often late into the evenings. I’ve never met someone who is such a perfect match.

We have the same beliefs and values, we both value communication and discussion, and we both find each other really considerate and caring. But we also have so much in common! We have similar food tastes, enjoy each other’s taste in music, both enjoy PC gaming, and cuddles and both of our favorite stores are the dollar store. The most interesting thing is we both share the exact same birthday just 3 years apart (24M) (21F).

We’ve been really open with each other and we’ve been feeling the exact same way about each other. We are each others type and find the other very attractive. Both of us have been feeling like everything has been going really well and we make the other one happy.

We haven’t seen each other in person yet but we plan on seeing each other on Friday for the first time. We’re both really excited! I think I found the girl of my dreams.
