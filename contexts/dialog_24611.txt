MIKE: Okay?
ELLIE: Unbelievably handsome. You look fantastic in a suit.
TOMMY: Nice threads Dad.
MIKE: Yeah, I think so.
MIKE: Hi.
CLAIRE: I'm sorry. I'm not sure how this works. I have to go out... is that all right?
MIKE: Uh...
CLAIRE: I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
MIKE: I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
CLAIRE: Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
MIKE: Right. That's true.
CLAIRE: Can we go then?
MIKE: I'm supposed to call in.
CLAIRE: There's a phone in the car.
CLAIRE: Do you have another tie? Something more conservative?
MIKE: Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me. It's at home.
