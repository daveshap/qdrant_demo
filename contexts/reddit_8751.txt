Is there legal precedent for Mueller's team behaviour regarding Concord Management's defence, and it is revealing of underlying issues with his legal case against them?
Over the past few days there has been a developing story regarding Concord Management's response to Mueller's indictments. 

For a refresh, Concord Management was one of the principal entities involved in Mueller's original indictment [source](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1035562/download). This is the entity run by "Putin's chef", Yevgeny Prigozhin, allegedly operating "Russian troll farms" to explicitly interfere in the United States 2016 election. A CNN expose [here](https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/17/politics/russian-oligarch-putin-chef-troll-factory/index.html)

I would have thought this entity would have one of the strongest cases regarding the evidence in the indictment.

The developing story over the last few days is that the Concord Management legal team seems to be fighting back [source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/russian-company-s-lawyer-plays-hardball-in-mueller-investigation) and Mueller's team have requested delays [source](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000163-2d3b-d9b5-af73-ffff51b70001) - some legal commentary is pointing to these issues as revealing the case isn't as strong as believed [source](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/is-robert-muellers-russian-troll-farm-indictment-falling-apart/).

Does the current behaviour of Mueller's legal team reveal potential programs? Is the behaviour expected in such legal cases? Specifically regarding delaying discovery over the technicalities of receiving a subpoena?
