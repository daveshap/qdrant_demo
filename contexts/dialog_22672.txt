MAGGIE: Okay, he's on base. Can we talk about my life now? -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah. He's totally out to get me.
PEGGY: For what reason? Some personal satisfaction?
MAGGIE: That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
PEGGY: It's probably because you got him fired.
MAGGIE: Ya think?
PEGGY: Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look! Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
MAGGIE: There he is. Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
PEGGY: Where?
MAGGIE: Over there. Ten o'clock. He's talking to our little Dennis. Dennis will turn into one of those sources say" things."
PEGGY: He looks better with that stuff out of his hair. He's an attractive man.
