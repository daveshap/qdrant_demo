Opinion on living situation/budget for grad students
TLDR: 1000 rent and utilities, 20 minute commute vs. 500 rent and utilities, hour and half commute - 2300/month stipend.  Can I afford to break the 30% rule?

I'm starting my PhD program this fall.  I will be moving an hour and half drive away from my husband who is going to remain at the job he loves and eventually move to the city with me once he finds something that will provide comparable pay and job satisfaction.

As for me, I will be receiving about 2300 a month from my fellowship, and I've been looking at 1 bedroom apartments or the option of living with a friend short term (6 months - 1 year) in her condo, while I wait to see if my husband finds something.

If I go with the 1 bedroom apartment, my finances will look like this:

* income: 2300
* rent: 850
* utilities (including internet): ~150 (it gets cold in winter)
* phone: 50
* car insurance: 75
* food: 200
* IRA (I'm being pushed to almost max it out): 400
* renters insurance: 15
* Hulu/netflix/amazon prime: ~30
* Cat: ~25
* Commute: 20 minutes on bus since there is no parking on campus during weekdays

If I live with my friend temporarily, I will pay about 500 a month in rent/utilities (instead of ~1000), but I will need to commute an hour and half on the bus since the bus route and transfers to and from her condo are clunky.  Other expenses should look similar.

Is the extra 500 worth it for a much longer commute as a 1st year grad student?  Will I be okay with almost half of my income going to rent and utilities (when the recommended percentage is 30%)?  I'm reluctant to get a roommate because I don't know when or if my husband will find a job over the next year and I'm not comfortable living with someone I don't know.  I also find it difficult to live and function under extremely noisy conditions, so I'm trying to find quieter buildings.

I should have a solid 3-4 month security fund saved up (if I were to live in the 1bed apartment), and I don't have any debt.
