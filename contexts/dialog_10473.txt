JOHN ADAMS: George, I'm sorry. We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
WASHINGTON: Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand. What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here? Who are those people in there? The fat ones in silk?
JOHN ADAMS: They are... friends of Congress.
WASHINGTON: Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
JOHN ADAMS: Partially...
SAM ADAMS: It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
