What's a good, steady career for an introvert who absolutely hates talking with other people?
I'm the kind of person who hates talking with other people. I'm typically polite and nice towards my coworkers, but talking to others stresses me out in ways more than any deadline could. 

I prefer eating lunch alone and taking walks by myself around the building. If possible, I would love to find a career where you could just come to work, sit at your desk, get stuff done, and then go eat lunch by yourself. 

Are there any steady careers that can provide that kind of introvert lifestyle?
