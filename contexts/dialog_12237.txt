MAUDE: Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life. They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in. Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can. Go team, go! Give me an L." Give me an "I." Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!! Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room."
HAROLD: I like you, Maude.
MAUDE: I like you, Harold. Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
MRS. CHASEN: This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
EDITH: What kind of a car is it?
