ALVY: I have some very good memories there.
ROB: What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
ALVY: Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.
ALVY'S FATHER: You fired the cleaning woman?
ALVY'S MOTHER: She was stealing.
ALVY'S FATHER: But she's colored.
ALVY'S MOTHER: SO?
ALVY'S FATHER: So the colored have enough trouble.
ALVY'S MOTHER: She was going through my pocketbook!
ALVY'S FATHER: They're persecuted enough!
ALVY'S MOTHER: Who's persecuting? She stole!
ALVY'S FATHER: All right-so we can afford it.
ALVY'S MOTHER: How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
ALVY'S FATHER: She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
