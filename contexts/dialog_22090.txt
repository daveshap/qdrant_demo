NICK: Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
RUDY: Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
NICK: Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
NICK: They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
RUDY: You gave them me.
NICK: I gave them me. Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along.
