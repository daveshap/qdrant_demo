This sub really helped me, just wanted to say thank you.
I'm using a new account, but previously with my old account I posted here quite a lot. One of my friends discovered my old Reddit account and all the posts I made here, and we had a pretty lengthy conversation about it.

This sub has some of the most genuinely helpful people, and I really wanted to say thank you to everyone who reached out and helped me on my old account.

stay safe everyone.
