MARCUS: She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
FRANK: Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date? She hit you with a bottle?
MARCUS: She loves me the way no woman ever has.
DISPATCHER LOVE: Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
MARCUS: I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good. Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
DISPATCHER LOVE: I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
MARCUS: Ten-four, hon. This is for you.
