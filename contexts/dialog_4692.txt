CONKLIN: I'm going to Paris.
ABBOTT: <u>No you're not</u>. You're not going anywhere. I'm shutting this down.
CONKLIN: You're not doing shit. You're so scared you can't even think.
ABBOTT: You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over. Call it off.
CONKLIN: I can't call it off. He's not responding. Get out of my way.
MARIE: It doesn't matter who you were before. It's who you want to be. That's all that matters. We have this money. We have what we have. I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but... I say we leave here. We leave this place. We go until we can't go anymore.
BOURNE: You could do that?
MARIE: Yes. That's who I want to be.

CLERK: My husband's out looking for him.
BOURNE: He run away often?
CLERK: That old beast? Miss his breakfast? Not a chance. It's always something, right?
BOURNE: Get in the basement.
CLERK: What?
BOURNE: Get everyone down in the basement.
CLERK: What the hell're you talking about?
BOURNE: You're in danger. All of you. I have no time to explain.
CLERK: Wait a minute --
BOURNE: I'm sorry.
