Dad thinks expiry dates are meaningless.
My Dad has no problem eating / drinking / using an ingredient / etc if it has passed the expiry date. I'm not talking about the bread that is a day passed, or the box of pasta that expired a week ago. He thinks its perfectly acceptable to drink juice that expired 8 months ago, or use deli meats that expired over a week ago "AS LONG AS IT HASN'T BEEN OPENED" 

Now, I could be way off when I say this (honestly), but isn't the purpose of an expiry date to tell the consumer when it is no longer recommended to use the product?

When I ask him if the sandwich he made me for lunch has any expired ingredients in it, he takes it personally and gets angry and violent at me. Sometimes he just dances around my question, not giving me an answer.

Me: "Hey what's the date on this muffin?"
Dad: "Smells fine to me"
Me: "No, is it expired? what is the date on the package"
Dad: "Son, I just had one. they're fine."

Occasionally for dinner, a part of the meal will taste sour or something to that effect and someone will complain. 

What my family says:
-This food doesn't taste good because it's expired

What my Dad hears:
-This food tastes bad because you don't know how to cook.
(and no amount of talking to him makes him understand)

If I try and throw away something thats expired, he says "Even if you wont eat it, I will. Put it back and I'll eat it." Problem is, he doesn't eat it. He eats the fresh food like everyone else and our cupboards fill up with expired food.

I had a girl I liked come over and she wanted a snack. I was so embarrassed having to tell her as she takes things out of the cupboards "that's expired, don't eat that."

Money isn't a concern. We're a very well off family so my Dad isn't trying to cut costs by eating expired foods.
