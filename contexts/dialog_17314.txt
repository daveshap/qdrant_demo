ORACLE: Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise. He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
NEO: What?
ORACLE: You're going to have to make a final choice. In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life. In the other hand, you will have your own. One of you is going to die. Which one, will be up to you.
