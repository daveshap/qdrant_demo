Ettercap man in the middle - ARP poison I am experimenting a bit with Ettercap in my local Wifi Lan.I have a router (R), my pc (P) with Ettercap running on it and my smarthphone (S).In particular am testing the ARP poison MIM attack and it seems to work, but I have some doubts.I have been able to make R believe that P has the S mac address and to make S believe that P has the R mac address. So the router maps the smartphone IP to my PC mac address and the smartphone maps the Router IP with my pc mac address.Now, when the Smartphone sends packets to the Router it uses the PC mac address and when the Router sends packets to the Smartphone it uses the PC mac address. Let's suppose that the Router sends a packet that should be for the Smartphone, the smartphone will get the packet as am using WIFI so everyone can see everything but will it drop because Mac Address mismatching?Also, the PC will be able to get Smartphone packets from the router, but layer 2 will not drop the packets as Mac address matches with PC Mac address, but as the IP does not match, the Kernel should not drop it?
