Any woman out there who feels that flying solo for the rest of their lives seems much more pleasant than having relationships?
I'm in my mid-twenties. Have dated seriously a few times, put everything I had into the process. After a while, I always reassessed the situation and asked myself what I got out of it. The answer always is very little, other than sex. 

My life, when I'm single, is very pleasant. At this point, I'm seriously questioning the values a relationship, no matter how trouble-free, would bring into my life.
