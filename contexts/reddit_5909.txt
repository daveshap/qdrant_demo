Almost finished with high school but don't have diploma yet. Should I go ahead and apply for a job?
I want to start working at the hospital in a tech position. It it a starting position and you work while you get certified. Problem is that the job listing requires a high school diploma but I don't have mine yet technically. I'm about to finish up with my final class and just have a senior project to do before I am finished which would take 3 weeks at best. Should I just go ahead and apply or wait until I'm done?  Thanks.
