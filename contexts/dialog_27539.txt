JACQUES: Why?
ENZO: Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
JACQUES: I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
ENZO: No. All you need is to want to be the best.
JACQUES: You're the best, Enzo!
ENZO: That's too easy! Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me: D'you know that French guy
DUFFY: This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete. Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
JOHANA: What kind?
DUFFY: Johana, am I boring you?
JOHANA: Sorry. Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little. What did you say?
DUFFY: I said that the file is incomplete.
