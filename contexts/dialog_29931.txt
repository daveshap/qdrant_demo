WOMAN: I call the policia.
JOHN: No!
JOHN: No police.
WOMAN: But, Senor--
JOHN: No police! Wait until I'm gone.
WOMAN: Senor, you need a doctor.
JOHN: No police!
JOHN: Hey.
DARRELL: Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
JOHN: Nothing.
DARRELL: Don't look like nothing.
JOHN: Just banged my head. It was an accident.
DARRELL: Another accident? You got to be more careful.
JOHN: Look, I just want to pick up my car.
DARRELL: She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
JOHN: How much?
DARRELL: Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
JOHN: How much!?
DARRELL: Hundred-fifty.
JOHN: To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
DARRELL: A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang. You know how long it took me to find that hose?
JOHN: About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
DARRELL: That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy. What you expect but fancy damn prices?
JOHN: That's a Ford, not a Ferrari. You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
DARRELL: That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
JOHN: What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
DARRELL: I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through. Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
JOHN: It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
DARRELL: Then you ain't gonna have the car.
JOHN: Listen, man. I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
