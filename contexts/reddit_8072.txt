Advice on finding scholarships?
Best places to look? I have found a few small scholarships to apply for but am finding that a lot of grad school scholarships that I've found so far are super specific as in you can only use them in certain schools and in certain subject areas. For reference I am going to be doing an MA in Strategic Public Relations at USC Annenberg!
