Regarding 'The Science of Interstellar', space warping section While reading Thorne's 'The Science of Interstellar', I came across this piece of information: <blockquote>  'Now, the Sun\u2019s equatorial plane divides space into two identical halves, that above the plane and that below. Nonetheless, Figure 4.4 shows the equatorial plane as warped like the surface of a bowl. It bends downward inside and near the Sun, so that diameters of circles around the Sun, when multiplied by \u03c0 (3.14159 . . . ), are larger than circumferences\u2014larger, in the case of the Sun, by roughly 100 kilometers.'</blockquote>Has anyone that has read this book got an explanation for me, I do not get the d*pi compared to circumference part, why does it differ?
