HELPMANN: Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
SAM: Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
HELPMANN: Gillian Layton?
SAM: Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
HELPMANN: I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
SAM: Help me!
HELPMANN: I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
SAM: This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
HELPMANN: Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
SAM: I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
HELPMANN: Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
SAM: Please, I've got to find Jill.
HELPMANN: Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
