I fucked up. Oh God did I fuck up. (x-post from several other subs)
Jesus Christ am I in deep. The last few days I've been texting a girl I used to be very close to, let's call her Allison. Well, I'm anxious to speak to her again because she was really a 'one that got away' sort of deal. She always had a thing for me but she never seemed that serious. Well, she texts me to wish me a Happy Thanksgiving, and I use the opportunity to strike up a conversation. I tell her I've missed her and have thought about her. We talk all night, and express that we've had deep feelings for each other that we've held back for a variety of reasons. We start talking about stuff that we can do to catch up, we've been flirting, everything is going amazing.

We talk all day for three days and I'm thrilled. She seems to be a little more mellow now than she was, but everything is fine. She also says that I've changed a lot since we've last spoken. Anyway, tonight we actually start talking about things of substance, and she brings up her ex-husband....

Allison was never married.

I'm texting a different fucking Allison....

This isn't the amazing ambitious girl that works at the homeless shelter and wants to become a nurse, this is the 35 year old that drove 40 minutes to watch me leave work. The one who I immediately regretted giving my number to because she texted me 40 times a day. The one who told my coworkers we were dating when I didn't even know her name.

So many details are coincidentally related, her ex lives in my college town, the distance is the same, all the little details are intertwined that I didn't realize for days.

What the fuck do I do now? If I just say "oops my bad lol" she'll be heartbroken, if I keep up the act she'll catch on eventually because I genuinely don't like her.... For fuck's sake help me.
