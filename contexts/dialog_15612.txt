FATHER: To where?
MAURICE: Pacifica, California.
FATHER: From where?
MAURICE: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
FATHER: I see.
FATHER: Why?
MAURICE: Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
FATHER: Most certainly.
MAURICE: And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
FATHER: That's a reasonable assumption.
MAURICE: I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
FATHER: Doubts? About what?
MAURICE: About my love for her.
FATHER: You don't have to prove anything to her.
MAURICE: I'm not proving to her. I'm showing her. And I know I don't have to. I want to. I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
