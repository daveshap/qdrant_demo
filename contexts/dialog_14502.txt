BRODY: What's that?
HOOPER: Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
BRODY: What? What?!
HOOPER: Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
BRODY: How can you tell?
HOOPER: Florida license plate.
BRODY: He ate a car?
HOOPER: No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
HOOPER: ...Nothing.
BRODY: What do we do?
HOOPER: If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
BRODY: Chum?
HOOPER: Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him. It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...
