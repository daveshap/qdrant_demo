ED: But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
ERIN: They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
ED: So what made you think it was?
ERIN: It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
ED: What medical records?
ERIN: The ones in the box of files. The box of files? The one from your office?
ED: I didn't see any medical records in there.
ERIN: Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh? And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>. Jesus.
ED: That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
ERIN: Course I did.
ED: Lemme see it, will you?
ERIN: I want a raise. And benefits. Including dental.
ED: Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
ED: Okay. A 5% raise, and --
ERIN: Ten. There's a lot of other places I could work.
ED: A ten percent raise and benefits. But that's it. I'm drawing the line.
ED: This is the only thing you found?
ERIN: So far. But that place is a pig sty. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
ED: Find out.
