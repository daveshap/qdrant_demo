Graduated college almost 3 years ago, but I haven't gotten into my field yet. Did I miss the boat? Am I still competitive?
Hey, Gurus. In June 2017 I graduated from the University of Washington with a BS in Information Technology. In the months after I sent out lots of applications, but never made any headway; a lot of denials, a handful of interviews, and even 3 precious last-round interviews, but I never managed to seal the deal with anything. Now nearly three years later, I'm wondering if it's too late. Can I still compete in today's market with an aging degree? Can I leverage my 7 years of customer service experience and 5 years of leadership roles in my favor? Should I just suck it up and live the Walgreen's life? Any advice on the matter would be so so appreciated. Thank you all in advance.
