Unemployed and unsure of priorities 41/F
I worked for a major telecom company for 15 years in network engineering/data engineering.   I was laid off at the end of 2017.  Due to health issues plus having severance I decided to freelance part time for a year.   In the middle of 2018 I became extremely ill due to a chronic condition I have had since birth.   Thankfully (and I am so grateful) I was able to find a new treatment and in January my family and I decided that returning to full-time employment would be the most prudent path.

My severance was spent by January 2019.   We have been living off of my husband's salary and savings.  I waited too long to apply for unemployment (has to be within a year of termination), the reason being that I was ill and couldn't work.  So we are OK for the moment but if something doesn't change we will be in a bad place.  We probably still have 6-9 months of wiggle room.

I am willing to do almost anything for work.  I have no pride issues over taking a minimum wage (or close) job.  I do have concerns over my physical health - while I am better I do not know if I could handle being on my feet for 8 hours in a work day.

Plus I have marketable skills! So many.  I can program computers.  Most of my last position at the telecom company was writing system engineering scripts for various purposes, moving data around so other platforms could pick it up and utilize it.  I have been a UNIX/Linux user for more than 20 years and have 10 years of experience working on Linux systems.  I have a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in network/computer engineering.   I can do data visualization in the major BI tools (power BI/Tableau).   And more!

Given my experience and skills I have been applying for jobs with databases, programming, Linux, and data visualization.  Up until two weeks ago I was getting 4-5 calls from recruiters per week.  In 3 months of searching I have had 4 phone interviews and two in person interviews.   The last in-person really looked like it was going to work out but I didn't get it.  OK that happens.  But for the last two weeks I have only gotten one call from a recruiter for a job that I wasn't remotely qualified for.  Only one application I've sent in so far has resulted in a response. So panic is definitely settling in.

I have no idea what to prioritize at this time.   Should I be looking for an "any job" no matter what it pays?   How much should I worry about my salary history?  If I take a "stop-gap" job will that interfere with my ability to find a professional level job?  How worried should I be about my health when we may not be able to pay the bills in a few months?  

&#x200B;

The real crux of this boils down to: will an "any job" affect my chances of getting a "real job" down the line?   There is so much conflicting information about this.   I also don't think my chances of getting hired for an "any job" are that high given my age/previous career.  They will take one look at me and know the minute I have a real offer I will be out the door.
