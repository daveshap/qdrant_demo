MERLE: I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
NICK: What are you, God?
MERLE: Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
NICK: They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
MERLE: What are you, hoping?
NICK: What else?
MERLE: I thought you might be praying.
NICK: I'm doing that too.
MERLE: I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
NICK: What do you think?
MERLE: Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
NICK: You're right... Okay, you're right.
MERLE: Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
NICK: Okay, okay! Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
MERLE: Forget Sal.
NICK: What do you mean?
MERLE: I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
NICK: Forget Sal?
MERLE: Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
NICK: Merle...
MERLE: LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
MERLE: We gotta play with more bullets.
NICK: We what?
MERLE: We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
NICK: More bullets in the gun?
MERLE: More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
NICK: With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
MERLE: Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got!
NICK: How many bullets?
MERLE: Three bullets -- minimum.
NICK: No way. No fucking way!
MERLE: I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
NICK: No. No way!
MERLE: When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
NICK: YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
