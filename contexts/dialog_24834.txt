TAYLOR: Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
BARNES: Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking. You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
TAYLOR: What is the condition of the bridge?
BARNES: The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
TAYLOR: Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline. Override the airlock sensors and hurry! We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
BARNES: Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
TAYLOR: What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -
BARNES: Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency! I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
