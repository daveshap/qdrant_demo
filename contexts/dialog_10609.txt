KINNEAR: How about that, Jack? Old Harry thought I was having him on.
HARRY: Shut up.
KINNEAR: Not going, Jack?
CARTER: I have to. Things to see to.
KINNEAR: Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
CARTER: Yeah, I'll do that. Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
ERIC: Jack! I didn't like that.
CARTER: You should have told me who you were working for.
ERIC: Cyril didn't like it, either.
CARTER: Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
ERIC: He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
