KASTLE: Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top.
KASTLE: Profits down there, philanthropy up here. Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
THEO: Nice set-up.
KASTLE: If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
THEO: What if he wants to get out?
KASTLE: He's earned an early retirement. But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future. I wanna show you something.
KASTLE: Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
THEO: What ever happened to just bowling?
KASTLE: There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
THEO: I like the sport the way it is.
KASTLE: A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! - shish kebabs. Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good. I think I could help you, Theo.
THEO: How Mr. Kastle?
KASTLE: You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
THEO: Why would you help me?
KASTLE: I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
