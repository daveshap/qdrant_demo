How efficient is a Peltier TEC1-12706 and TEC1-12715 I need to know some details about Peltier coolers before moving into making an air-conditioner. I have watched several videos on YouTube that demonstrate making air-conditioners with Peltier thermo-electric coolers. They show that there is a decrease in temperature, on the cool side, which is about -10 &#176;C to -20  &#176;C.We also know that Peltier coolers have an avg delta Tmax of ~65 &#176;C. But I am a bit confused about this Tmax. I think it is generally about 30-40 &#176;C because in practice absolute conditions can't be maintained. So, does the hot side temperature depend on the surrounding temperature?How much temperature decrease, would I get if the surrounding temperature is 40 &#176;C with 12 Volts? I also want to know if it is efficient for cooling a 10 ft x 10 ft room. I think using 5/6 Peltier cooler can handle that, but is it efficient? Or should I use a compressor?And should I use only a heatsink with a fan, or a heatsink + fan + watercooler, for cooling the hot side?
