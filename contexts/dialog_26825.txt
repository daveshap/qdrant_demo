DICKIE: You like jazz!
RIPLEY: I love jazz.
DICKIE: This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
MARGE: I never said that!
RIPLEY: Bird. That's jazz.
DICKIE: Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
RIPLEY: I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
DICKIE: Bird!
MARGE: Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
RIPLEY: He's not a man, he's a god.
DICKIE: Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
MARGE: It's vile.
DICKIE: Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come. It's great. You're going to love it.
