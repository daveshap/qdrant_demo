GFCI with 2x 20 amp 1 pole breakers I had a 15 amp 1 pole breaker connected to a gfci in my backyard.Now I need more juice. I decommissioned this 15 amp circuit.I fished a 12/3 from a 2 x 20 amp 1 pole breakers thinking I was connecting a regular outlet outside as I've got 2 hot wires now.I thought the GFCI would connect like a regular outlet until I remembered the load/line and my mistake.Could you recommend a solution for this kind of situation. I would rather not install a double box and 2x gfci. I would like to have a single receptacle with 2x 20 amp and be able to gfci it somehow.I could fish a new wire. Else, I ran out of idea.It's a Nova panel 200 amp. 1985 I guess. I use Eaton cutler-hammer DNPL breakers.The double breaker fits bottom right. Not installed on the picture yet.
