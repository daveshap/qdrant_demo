SEFTON: Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
DUNBAR: My legs are frozen.
SEFTON: You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly -- -- one minute and twenty seconds.
DUNBAR: Sefton!
SEFTON: What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
DUNBAR: Not you.
SEFTON: What some brandy?
DUNBAR: Yeah.
SEFTON: Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
DUNBAR: It's on me.
SEFTON: You won't get off that cheap.
DUNBAR: What are the chances busting out of here?
SEFTON: We'll know in forty seconds. Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
