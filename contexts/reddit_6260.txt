Got a job at a grocery store. Haven't been called and given training schedule/other info.
So, on 7/22(a Monday) I went to an interview at a local grocery store. I wasn't even really interviewed, and was basically asked if I had open availability and did I want the job. Said yes, obviously. 

Was told that the next day I would receive an e-mail with a link to fill out tax info and other paperwork, then after I filled it out it would take a few days on their end to finalize whatever they had to do and I would receive a call with my training schedule and all that. 

I filled out the on-boarding paperwork about 10 minutes after receiving the e-mail the day after I was interviewed. Then I waited for a phone call. 

I called the next Monday and talked to someone and told them I had filled out the paperwork. Was again told that it would take a few days. OK, whatever. 

Two weeks from when I was interviewed go by. I call and ask if there was something I needed to do and was told that I was in the final step and I'd receive a call on Wednesday. 

It is now the following Wednesday, over 3 weeks from when I was first interviewed. 

What do I do? 

At this point I feel like I should just give up and start looking for something else. This wasn't a must-have job for me, since I'm going to be moving in the middle of October. I just wanted a job so I wouldn't have to dig too far into my savings to cover my recurring bills. 

I'm kind of pissed at myself because the day after I got this job, I received a call from Panera Bread and told them I had already found something. I used to work with a guy who works there and I asked him to give my name to his manager. I should have gone to that interview.
