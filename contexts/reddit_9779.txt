Questions about getting a job in academic advising? I can help.
I feel like I consistently see questions about getting into advising, including job interviews, resumes and cover letters, gap years, etc.

I'm graduating with my Masters this week and I accepted a full-time advising job a month ago among a few offers. I have worked in an advising setting for two years inclusive of my graduate work experiences. 

I am a very young-age professional, but went through a few interviews, and am happy to provide tips, advice, and more to help people out.
