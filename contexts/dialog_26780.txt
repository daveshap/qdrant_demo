DYSON: Do you know about the chip?
SARAH: What chip?
DYSON: They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne... It's gotta be from the other one like you.
TERMINATOR: The CPU from the first terminator.
SARAH: Son of a bitch, I knew it!
DYSON: They told us not to ask where they got it. I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know. I didn't want to know.
SARAH: Those lying motherfuckers!
DYSON: I was scary stuff, radically advanced. It was shattered... didn't work. But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of. All this work is based on it.
TERMINATOR: I must be destroyed.
SARAH: Can you get us in there, past security?
