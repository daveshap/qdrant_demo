GEORGE: That was him.
JILL: Yes.
GEORGE: You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
JILL: Yes.
GEORGE: Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
JILL: I'd like you to leave now.
JILL: -- and take this with you.
GEORGE: Where did this come from?
JILL: Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
JILL: So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
GEORGE: Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
JILL: Obviously there were others, weren't there?
GEORGE: Obviously.
JILL: How many?
GEORGE: What do you wanna know for?
JILL: I just want to know, that's all.
GEORGE: What difference does it make?
JILL: I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
GEORGE: Baby, please don't... I love you.
JILL: I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
GEORGE: Baby, don't do this --
JILL: -- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
GEORGE: -- please, baby --
JILL: -- no, it'll help me, really --
GEORGE: How?
JILL: I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
