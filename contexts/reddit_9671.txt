Anyone done a NACA summer internship?
I'm trying to find someone to reach out to in regards to getting a little more info about NACA summer internships, specifically for grad students. I'm currently in housing, and thinking about doing a NACA as opposed to an ACUHO-I, just to diversify and get some new experiences. However, as a housing grad, my dates are a little less flexible than others regarding when I have to be back on campus for training, and just wanted someone who has gone through the process before to ask some questions and talk a little bit more about. Also, because I don't really want to pay an application fee for something I wouldn't go through with if it isn't matching up to my expectations when I finally get deeper into the process.

Any help is appreciated, thank you!
