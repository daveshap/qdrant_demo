BUD: Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
FRAN: No -- I like it.
BUD: Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
FRAN: Of course not.
BUD: Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side -- is that better?
FRAN: Much better.
BUD: Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
FRAN: This is a bad day for me.
BUD: I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
FRAN: I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
BUD: Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
FRAN: Why?
BUD: He and I are like this. Sent me a Christmas card. See?
