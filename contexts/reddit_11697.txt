I am in no way gaining any weight and I'm hating this
Since I was a child I've always been really tall and slim and though the kinder type tells me it's always better this way than being fat it still bothers me A LOT.
My family and doctors said I am like that because of my habitude but that's so bullshit. Everyone is able to put some weight on when they want it, why cannot I do the same?

I can't say I was bullied in school, but there were times I was called something like "skeleton" and similar. (English is not my mother tongue)

Probably because that's why I often feel ashamed of my body and disgusted by it. Usually I am a cheerful pal, have friends, I go out fairly often and I'm working out which finally shows some minimal results but I am still not gaining weight.

I've been tested for many things, all of them negative but they say I probably have IBS, Irritable bowel syndrome. A stress-related issue which is almost impossible to get completely rid of.

As you can see I'm not in the perfect mood, I'm having moodswings changing from + to - in a matter of few days. 
Sometimes I feel great and see hope in the future, through God and love with someone but it tends to fade after a time.

I am currently thinking about switching to a very strict diet which usually puts the actual symptoms to rest regarding the IBS but it is not confirmed to help me with my desire.

I read a lot, I tried a lot. Nothing helped me so far.  I am 21, 193 cm and around 72kg.

I feel like if I do this and if it's not helping I am left with no hope in life to accept my body which is crucial for mental health in the long term.

Thank you for listening!

TL;DR: I am tall and slim and I haven't gained any weight in literally 3-4 years.
