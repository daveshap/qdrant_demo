Does anyone else find dating to be exhausting and potentially psychologically harmful?
You hear it all the time:

When you are interested in someone, you can't show too much interest. You have to make time for other things and show them you are too busy for them. You shouldn't make yourself not too available and keep your options open. You are basically told to play all these crazy mind games on a potential significant other. 

Personally, I have spent time going on many dates that go nowhere because both parties are too busy playing this ridiculous mind game. At some point, both parties give up because we both assume we lost interest in one another. It seems just like an endless cycle of dating people for a few months and then moving on to the next one. 

I also feel like this situation has not only affected my self esteem but also my sanity, in a way.
