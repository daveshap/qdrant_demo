For people working in tech, your thoughts on taking a business / non-technical job in the tech industry?
For people with tech background, especially in the Bay Area, what are your thoughts on taking a business oriented job in a large tech company? e.g. Google, etc. For example, sales, product marketing, finance / accounting, etc.

I know engineers are what's in demand, but how feasible is it to make a good career out of a non-technical job in a large tech company?
