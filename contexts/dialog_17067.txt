GRAHAM: Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
CRAWFORD: He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
GRAHAM: Get him to Atlanta.
CRAWFORD: You said the guy down here is good.
GRAHAM: He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
CRAWFORD: What do you want to do?
GRAHAM: Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack. And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
