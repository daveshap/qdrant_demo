JODY: What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
KENNY: Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
JODY: I'm making you feel like meat?
KENNY: Yeah.
JODY: You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
KENNY: That's not why we broke up.
JODY: You flaunt some slut in my face.
KENNY: Sharon's far from a slut.
JODY: And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
KENNY: Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
KENNY: Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
JODY: This party is sick.
KENNY: Jody. Wait.
JODY: What?
KENNY: I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
JODY: Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
DAD: I know where you're going.
SANDY: 
DAD: Your brother told us.
SANDY: Daddy....
DAD: Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
SANDY: You're not?
DAD: No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you.
