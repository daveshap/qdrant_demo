Feeling very discouraged after first job interview rejection?

Hey guys, 

I’m graduating this spring with a bachelor’s degree in health sciences. I have 4 years sales experience at Nordstrom as a top seller, along healthcare experience as a primary care intern. I recently had an interview with a genetic testing company (prenatal testing), for an associate sales rep position. I truly felt like the interview went really well. I was very enthusiastic about the position, and I felt like I connected well with the person I was interviewing with. Our convo was upbeat, I asked a lot of questions, and there was no awkward silence during the 45 minutes we spoke.
Today I got a call and was told they are no longer going to consider me a candidate for this position, primarily due to my lack of experience as a recent college grad. The recruiter then told me that the only feedback they could give me is to have “a little bit more energy”, which completely caught me off guard. Although I would describe myself as outgoing and a people-person, I definitely have a calm demeanor. I don’t have a super hyper personality all the time, but I can’t change that. I feel very discouraged and like I’m not cut out for a career in medical sales because of this. I know this was my very first interview, but Im finding myself questioning my abilities. Does anyone have any advice out there? Or similar stories to share?
