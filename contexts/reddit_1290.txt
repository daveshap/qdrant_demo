Anxiety about making noise
Does anyone else have such anxiety about being loud and making noise? You don’t want to annoy anyone or draw attention to yourself. Making popcorn makes me extremely anxious because it’s me making so much noise. I can’t play the TV or video games loudly out of fear someone will hear. And sexual or romantic activity is the worst noise anxiety. Does anyone else experience this? If so, do you have any advice?
