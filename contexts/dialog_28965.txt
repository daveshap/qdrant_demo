SHORTIE: Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
DAN: How?
SHORTIE: Where do you live?
DAN: In New York.
SHORTIE: Your wife knows that, don't she?
DAN: Sure.
SHORTIE: Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
SHORTIE: Will be back in four weeks"-- --that saves you eighty cents right there!"
DAN: That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
SHORTIE: Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
DAN: How?
SHORTIE: Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks.""
DAN: That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
SHORTIE: Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out. Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word."
DAN: Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
SHORTIE: Just a minute--I don't think we need the word Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?"

SHORTIE: Now we get it down to two words--next month.""
DAN: Send that.
SHORTIE: Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?

DAN: June? That's my wife's name.
SHORTIE: That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
DAN: O.K.! Send that!
SHORTIE: Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
