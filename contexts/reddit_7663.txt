Any current/past PMFs here?
Just got accepted as a Presidential Management Fellowship finalist. I'll mostly be applying for Forest Service and BLM jobs (maybe some USGS etc., depending what's available). Any other new finalists on here, or past finalists with advice?

Edit: for those who don't know, the PMF program is for people who just finished or are about to finish graduate school and want to work for a federal agency.
