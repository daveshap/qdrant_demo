I've been ghosted by 28 of my last 30 attempts at dating
First of all, by "attempt at dating" I am refering to having either matched and subsequently talked to, or met and subsequently talked to a girl. I dont count getting ghosted directly after a match by not getting a reply to my first message.

Also, I have stopped double-texting long ago. If you dont reply to my message within a week, or, even worse, leave me on "read" for a whole week, I consider myself ghosted and will remove you from my contacts.

I consider myself an average looking guy, a 7 on a good day, slightly chubby. I work out but I guess I need to work on my diet as well. 25, got my own place, own car(s), working in IT. In many ways I am a stereotypical introverted nerd, with the exception that I usually dont have troubles communicating with people. Which makes it even worse to be ghosted, since it just shows that even more "socially adjusted" people are worse at communication than a "socially awkward geek".

Since the beginning of 2019 I had roughly 30 shots at dating women as outlined in my first paragraph. From a dating app standpoint that might not be alot, but what can a 6-7/10 chubby geek do, amiright?

Of the 30 girls I met 8 of them through normal means and 22 of them through OLD. Honestly I dont try to differentiate between the two, OLD should just be a shortcut to meeting people the normal way anyway.

I actually **got a second date with ONE** of them. In fact, I got all the way. Best sex I have ever had honestly and we had a brief FWB thing but it ended when she actually got a real boyfriend, since I wasnt looking for a serious relationship at the time. Still, she was probably the most mature out of all of them, and she was 22 years old.

Another **one** was up-front with me, albeit only 6 hours before our first date. Apparently she had another date the day before and the guy was so great she was going to just roll with it. Might have been an excuse, might have not, but at least she told me anything.

And thats where the "positive" experiences end and the sad shit starts.

**Three** of them ghosted me after the first date. Fine, I probably didnt make a good first impression. Maybe I just wasnt attractive in person. Maybe I was overbearing, or too quiet. Maybe there just wasnt any spark. But please, telling me "Sure, we can do this again.", then ghosting me two days later is the worst of the worst.

**10** of them ghosted me after exchanging numbers, which is probably the weirdest thing. In modern day dating culture exchanging numbers is pretty much the equivalent of being "in". If you give somebody your number you kind of let them into your social circle. So why ghost them right after? It literally happened to me that I got a girls number, we exchanged like 5-6 messages on Whatsapp and then I was left on read forever. Why? Just why?

And the **15** others, well, they all ghosted me on a dating app itself, which I dont consider worth talking about, because its (sadly) just par for the course. Get a match, talk to match, get a better match, ghost first match and so on and so forth. Ive learned to not even waste a single thought on people who ghost on dating apps, because its just that easy.

Overall it paints a rather sad picture. I am not mad for not having gotten laid with 30 women, in fact over half of them had in the end turned out unattractive for me, but even then just getting to know them for some much needed perspective is always fine for me.

What makes me sad is just how less others tend to care anymore. Dating is no longer about getting to know other people and see if youre compatible, its fishing for your perfect opposite which will never exist and everyone else is just thrown aside. And OLD is nothing but a game these days, except with real people. 99% of people on OLD actually have zero space for more people in their lives, they just like the brief distraction and confidence boost of playing the game.
