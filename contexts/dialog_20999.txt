SUSAN: I'm going to go out for a while. I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
O'BRIEN: What did you want my hair for?
SUSAN: Something else I want to try.
O'BRIEN: I could go with you.
SUSAN: I think it would be better for me to go alone. I'm sure Sim is looking for you. Just sit tight. I'll bring you back a pizza.
O'BRIEN: No cheese.
SUSAN: I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
