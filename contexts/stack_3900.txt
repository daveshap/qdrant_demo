Calculate confidence that a population is evenly distributed between several values I apologize if this is too basic, or is poorly worded. It's been a long time since I sat in a stats class, and I'm having trouble figuring out how to search for what I need.I have a system that generates results of 7 different types. It could be modeled as a bag of infinite size, filled with balls of 7 different colors. I have a sample set of 97 results, and they are distributed among the 7 types: 11, 17, 9, 10, 17, 19, 14.It is my theory that the likelihood of getting a result of any one of the 7 types is 1:7, i.e. the results are expected to be evenly distributed among the 7 different types.How can I calculate a confidence value to support or refute my hypothesis?
