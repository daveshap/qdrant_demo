SANDY: You were late.
JEFFREY: I'm really sorry.
SANDY: What am I going to do?
JEFFREY: You want to go talk to him?
SANDY: Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
SANDY: You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
JEFFREY: That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
SANDY: Shoot.
JEFFREY: Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
SANDY: Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
JEFFREY: Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
SANDY: Oh yeah?
JEFFREY: Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
SANDY: Jeffrey!!
JEFFREY: Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
SANDY: I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
JEFFREY: Yeah.
SANDY: Jeffrey?. Why?
JEFFREY: I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
SANDY: You like mysteries that much?
JEFFREY: Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
