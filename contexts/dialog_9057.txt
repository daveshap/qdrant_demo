ANNIE: Not bad...I shoulda warned you. Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
JACK: Like what?
ANNIE: One year he had a solar system named after her...
JACK: Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
ANNIE: Mom liked it.
JACK: Maybe there’s a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
ANNIE: That’s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
JACK: Right. That’s a major oversight... So if I’m Kate...I can’t really afford the finer things, my husband’s career is a crushing disappointment to me, I’m trapped in suburbia...
