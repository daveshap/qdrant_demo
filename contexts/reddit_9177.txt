My step daughter's birthday was yesterday and she received more cash than I have in my bank account.
Let me preface this by saying that although about 110% of my income goes to bills, only about 90% of my husband's income goes to bills (this is an ongoing point of contention), so our family isn't at risk of being homeless or starving. 

Yesterday was my step daughter's 12th birthday. Between everyone in her families, she received $540 in just cash. I was so happy for her as she proudly counted it out in front of us last night, but it also made me want to cry. What kind of life am I living that my dependant has more money than I do?

I'm so ashamed of my financial situation that my husband is the only one who knows how bad things are so I just needed to get this off my chest. While it is crushingly depressing, I have never been more motivated to get my finances under control.
