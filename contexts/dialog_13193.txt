BRAD: C'mon, Joey. I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
JOEY: Yeah? Well, you just struck out. It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way. Not tight skirts. Tight stories.
BRAD: Right. Like last night's doozie.
JOEY: I know what I saw.
BRAD: And I believe what you say. But this is TV. No pictures, no story.
