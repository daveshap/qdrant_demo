REESE: But outside, it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair...blood. Grown for the cyborgs.
SARAH: Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...

SARAH: Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
REESE: No. Not yet. Not for about forty years.
SARAH: So, it's from the future, is that right?
REESE: One possible future. Four your point of view. I don't know the tech stuff.
SARAH: And you're from the future too?
REESE: Right.
