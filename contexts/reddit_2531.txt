How do I say "I want a chill job" without using those words?
Due to health reasons and a desire to survive while I transition to a  more creative career in music and writing, I want to take an easier day job. I work in marketing and it's pretty brutal. The work itself is not difficult, but I've yet to meet a CEO or director who isn't flying by the seat of their pants, that actually has a mission, yearly goals, and vision of what things we do and, more importantly, what we *don't*  do. Every day there's a new fire. This is beyond crisis communication -  that's different, I don't do that. This is like, "we need a campaign on  XYZ in three days including radio, tv, print, billboards, social media,  etc etc etc," which they will then forget about the next week and that campaign just fizzles and dies. Meanwhile, the actual steady work we have been doing gets pushed back and is in danger of not meeting hard-as-steel deadlines.

AnYwAy, I  want to work a job where I'm not asked to create Michelangelo's David  in three days, where the biggest emergency is that we need to run an errand during office hours. I'm thinking administrative support type jobs. However, I'm overqualified in that I've had loads of responsibility and the work I do is very big and splashy.

My initial thought is to highlight what I bring to the table (project managing, creativity, desktop publishing) rather than my own desires.  However, most places will ask "why do you want this job?" or "why do you want to work for us?"

How do I tell, say, a university department or contract law firm that I want a more chill job *without saying* I want a more chill job? 

(or if you know of a chill job using the same skills, lmk!)
