Can a hiring manager or recuriter contact your adviser about how bad you interviewed?
So, I have a really smart doctorate graduate student friend who recently had her first computer science interview for an internship in a long time. She doesn't interview well at all and wasn't able to answer things she would know. The recruiters asked for her adviser and now is freaking out about them contacting the adviser and losing her funding. She is scared of being revealed as an imposter based on how much she bombed the interview. She suffers from a lot of imposter syndrome issues. 

First of all, is this even ethical for a recruiter to do?   And any thoughts about this scenario?
