Stop asking for nudes!!!
I don't know if this is just the name of the game, but does anyone else always have the problem of people constantly asking you for nudes on the dating apps? So this is across Tinder and Bumble. It would start off as a normal conversation, getting to know each other, and then out of the blue, they would ask for a nude. 

I guess I don't understand why they would think that would be appropriate to ask or maybe they've done it in the past and people have said yes? Personally, I am just shocked someone would ask that and it just makes me think they were only talking to me to get to that point. They were only talking to me in hopes I would send them a nude. Part of me wants to ask them why they think it's okay to ask that, but I typically will just unmatch and not engage. 

I guess with dating apps, it is the luck of the draw but it is still unsettling, to me, whenever I get asked to send someone a nude.
