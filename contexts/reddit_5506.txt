how can I explain discord moderation/management to an employer?
So the title pretty much explains it all, (will be re-posting on other subs) I have over three years of discord moderation and management experience including staff management and anything that really would be required to have an IRL management job, just any way I look at it I can't really seem to find a good way to explain that in a resume, That's all the job experience I really have and I think some attributes from that stuff can really help in an IRL management job. To help a little more, my duties included hiring and firing of staff, making reports via google docs and doing monthly staff evaluations as well as handling reports about staff member's complaints or issues regarding other staff + customer complaints.
