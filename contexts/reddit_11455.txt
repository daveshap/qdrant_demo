Kneecap popped out today, life feels over.
Today was the first day of soccer conditioning, after about an hour my right kneecap popped out. The medical term is patellar dislocation I believe, and it happened after some running and playing. It hurts like a bitch, the swelling is bad and my knee looks like a lump. I can't walk or move hardly. I bet after my visit to the doctor's tomorrow I will be sent to physical therapy and that worries me because my mom doesn't have all the money in the world. I feel like such a fucking burden, I got $70 cleats, my mom paid $75 for a camp that I entirely just fucked myself for. I don't even know if I should go on with the season, I feel pathetic and such a flake. Everyone else, the good players, will continue and have fun while I just sit and cry like a baby. I also was supposed to take my driver's test tomorrow, but with my right leg being my dominant one, and having it practically disabled for the time being, I know I won't be able to drive and take the test. School is starting on Thursday and I won't be able to drive myself and all my friends whom I told I would be able to drive will be disappointed in me fucking up like usual. 

Sorry for the wall of text, and I'm sorry if it feels like I'm whining or complaining. I just needed to get it out and have someone to talk to.
