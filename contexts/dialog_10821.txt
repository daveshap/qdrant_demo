VENKMAN: This is the one that looked at Dana.
JANOSZ: It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
VENKMAN: I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory. If she says it looked at her, it looked at her. Hey, you! Vigie! Look at me. I'm talking to you. Hey! Look at me when I'm talking to you.
VENKMAN: Beautiful, beautiful. Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it. Okay, he's playing it cool. Let's finish up and get out of here.
STANTZ: I'll get one more reading.
WINSTON: Now that's one ugly dude.
STANTZ: Huh? What?
WINSTON: You finished here?
STANTZ: What? Yeah.
WINSTON: Are you all right? You coming down with something?
STANTZ: No, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for a second there. Let's go.
JANOSZ: So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
VENKMAN: Not. Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
SPENGLER: There's definitely something going on in that studio. The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
WINSTON: I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
