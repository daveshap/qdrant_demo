EARLY: Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
ADELE: I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
BRIAN: Carrie, watch for Early.
CARRIE: What are you going to do?
BRIAN: I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free.
CARRIE: What about you?
BRIAN: I don't know.
