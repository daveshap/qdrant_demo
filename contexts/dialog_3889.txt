HEATHER: You gonna be alright?
DOMINI: Sure. I'm sorry.
HEATHER: No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
DOMINI: Get some more beer.
HEATHER: I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
DOMINI: Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
HEATHER: What're you afraid's going to happen?
DOMINI: That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
