im ugly, overweight, and cant talk to the girl i like.
Ever since I was little, it seems like I've been screwed over. My older sister was being treated like royalty, and i was pushed to the side. I've always been ugly, and over the past 6 years, I've been steadily gaining weight. I'm now weighing in at 280 pounds, and I'm only 14. Although I'm going to the gym, the weight keeps increasing, and I'm eating right. The girl I've like for the past 4 years barely pays attention to me, and whenever we are around each other, I have to tiptoe away because she's not paying attention. I'll try and talk to her, but nothing,happens. I've never considered suicide, but my options are becoming increasingly smaller, and I'm not sure my parents would even notice if I left. I don't know what to do, and I need help desperately. Here's a pic to put into perspective how big I am. https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/1150967_3271421602139_321185713_n.jpg
