NICK: Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
VADA: And I thought I was weird.
NICK: You are weird. Let's just go.
VADA: Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
NICK: Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
VADA: This isn't just a mood ring.
NICK: Does it work?
VADA: Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
NICK: Boyfriend?
VADA: Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
NICK: Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
VADA: Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
NICK: Let me see if it changes colors on me.
VADA: ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
NICK: Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
VADA: Don't force it, you'll break it.
NICK: I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
VADA: I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
NICK: Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
VADA: Give it to me!
NICK: Come and get it.
VADA: Just give it to me!!
NICK: Just come and get it...right here!
VADA: DON'T, come on!!!
NICK: Woah, watch it!
VADA: DON'T!!!
NICK: Uh oh...
VADA: What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
NICK: ...I dropped it.
VADA: In the tar??
NICK: It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
NICK: Where are you going???
VADA: Owh...
