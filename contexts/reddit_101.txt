How do I forget a crush
I grew up going to a v small catholic school w about 25 kids in each grade (nursery-8th). Since sixth grade, I kinda like this one kid and he kinda liked me but I was always quiet so nothing ever rlly happened. We went to the same high school and we both found a friend group and basically grew up, but when we had classes tg we would always sit and laugh and joke and j generally have a good time. Last year he would always snap me, dm me, try to start convos, uk. Then we talked a little over the summer but again, I’m pretty quiet, so not all the time. I always knew I liked him deep down but was always afraid to say it and I was pretty sure he liked me too, bc that’s what all my friends said. When this year started, we still talked for a little, but as the months went on, he found a new friend group full of toxic people and girls who are all over him. We barely talk anymore and even tho I sometimes see him trying to talk to me in the hallway, he’s just a completely different person-the attention has gotten to his head and he usually acts like a total asshole now. At the beginning of the year, I was considering telling him I liked him bc, hey we’re about to graduate after going to school tg since nursery so what do I have to lose? But now I wanna stop having feelings for him bc he’s just not the same. How do I forget someone I’ve been interested in for six years??
