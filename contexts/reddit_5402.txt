How do you deal with wanting to leave your current job but not receiving an offers yet to quit and start a new job?
Hi everyone, just looking for advice on the emotional/mental aspect. I really want out of my job, but so far I've only had a couple interviews with no callbacks yet so I have to grin and bear it until something else bites. I know I need to stay on the horse and keep applying and interviewing, but how do I deal with the misery I feel in my current job? I have no interest in the industry nor do I have any interest in the product we sell. I am the project lead for an aspect of the service that requires giving feedback and suggestions, and I am just not interested in participating in the conversation because I really don't care about enhancing the product or making it better or its future in any way. How best can I deal with this without having a negative appearance/energy?
