Abusive father in quarantine. What exactly am I supposed to do about it
I usually just leave or go somewhere if he flips his shit, or at the very least I go the next day or that weekend. I've been trapped in my house for three weeks now and I've been screamed at and threatened on a virtually daily basis save for a few lucky days. I'm really losing my will to try at this point. I feel like my whole body is revolting against the idea of living here in quarantine for much longer. What the fuck do I do about it

Just an edit: thank you all for your advice and support. It means the world to me that anyone cares at all. Thanks for shining a little bit of light on my life in these dark times. It makes me feel a little less alone in it all.
