BROWN: One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges. It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it? Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
ARCHIE: So? Someone'll send it on ahead.
BROWN: Aye, but will they?
ARCHIE: John, it's not your problem what she eats.
BROWN: The woman's surrounded by fools! She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning. Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
ARCHIE: She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
BROWN: But I'm the only one she trusts.
ARCHIE: She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does. You want to be careful.
BROWN: I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway. That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs. I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out. There's no stopping me now.
