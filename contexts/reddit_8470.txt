What are the upsides and criticisms of a "Medicare for All Who Want It" plan?
Pete Buttigieg is currently running on a platform that includes ["Medicare for All Who Want It"](https://peteforamerica.com/policies/health-care/), a more moderate alternative to Sanders' and Warren's "Medicare for All" plan.

From his website,

>The Medicare for All Who Want It public alternative will help America reach universal coverage by providing an affordable insurance option to the currently uninsured. The public alternative will provide the same essential health benefits as those currently available on the marketplaces and ensure that everyone has access to high-quality, comprehensive coverage.  
>  
>The plan will automatically enroll individuals in affordable coverage if they are eligible for it, while those eligible for subsidized coverage will have a simple enrollment option. A backstop fund will reimburse health care providers for unpaid care to patients who are uninsured. Individuals who fall through the cracks will be retroactively enrolled in the public option.

Proponents of the plan argue that it provides all Americans with affordable healthcare coverage without the expense that comes with replacing private healthcare, and would incentivize private healthcare to keep their prices low. Opponents ([New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/medicare-for-all.html) incoming) argue that: "the price of health care services — not insurance or pharmaceutical profits — is the primary driver of America’s ballooning health care spending. Only a single-payer system can restrain those costs." [Conservative critics](https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/29/why-pete-buttigiegs-medicare-for-all-who-want-it-is-a-sham/) of the plan seem to fear that it will eventually lead to the elimination of private insurance altogether.

What are the benefits and drawbacks of this type of plan (particularly compared to the Medicare for All and/or our current system)? How feasible is this? I am having trouble finding reliable & detailed arguments for this, since searching "Medicare for All Who Want It" usually just returns results about Medicare for All.
