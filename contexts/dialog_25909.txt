LUKE: Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
RACHEL: For what?
LUKE: Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
RACHEL: I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
LUKE: You don't need to. I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
RACHEL: Can't handle them myself is what you mean. Can't.
RACHEL: You don't trust me to be alone with them.
LUKE: I trust you of course I do but --
RACHEL: But? But what?
LUKE: But you're not good at this. Not yet. I'm sorry.
RACHEL: I know how responsible, caring adults parent children. I'm bribe 'em. But 'em a dog or something. Maybe a Doberman.
RACHEL: Look. I know they hate me.
LUKE: They don't hate you --
RACHEL: And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
LUKE: Nobody's telling them to hate you --
RACHEL: Really? Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
LUKE: It's complicated for Jackie. It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
RACHEL: Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
LUKE: No you don't. And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
RACHEL: You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long! Jesus what did you see in her? I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
