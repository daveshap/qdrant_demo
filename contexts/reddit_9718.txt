Negotiations in Job Offer
Has anyone ever negotiated salaries and/or a PTO/working from home/etc.  in a Student Affairs job offer?

 I have not heard of this from many of my peers but wanted to know if any mid-level or senior professionals have successfully navigated negotiating when they receive job offers (from a private or public institution).

Thanks all!
