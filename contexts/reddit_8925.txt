Can I get a summary of politics of the African Union and how it compares to the EU?
I came across [this article](http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2017/01/gambia-170113211403895.html) and I realised I know very little about the African Union and its politics. 

How strong is the AU? Does its strength vary by region (Africa is really big after all)? What are its plans for the future? 

What is the relations between member states like? How does it compare to the EU? In the article above, they threaten military intervention, which is something I don't ever see happening in the EU.
