Wife cheated update
Edit: So I've been getting a lot of DM's asking how I caught her etc and what I did. So I came back from a late night jog as I find it peaceful and relaxing as the streets are empty, I came back home to have a shower of course as I was sweaty as fuck. I entered the apartment and just headed to the bedroom and there is where I saw her with another man in bed. My god damn silk sheets tainted by them 😔😂, but yeah it's weird cause I thought I would lash out but I was unusually calm about it. I told the guy to leave and he was literally shitting himself and scrambling to pick up his belongings, like this guy is literally tripping everywhere. 

I think he was afraid as I was just very calm and he didn't expect it. Anyway I spoke to my wife asking how long it's been happening and she told me who he is etc, it's a childhood "friend". After that I went to the train station which is where the first post came in.

Edit 2: People are also asking how long we were together. So I met my loyal and faithful wife at 14 and we got married at 20. So in total that's 12 years of faithfulness from the amazing wife. 

Edit 3: Holy shit whoever gave the platinum thanks so much???

Edit 4: People are surprised that I'm over this so quick and I'm calm about it, I guess it's down to the fact I live by the rule that is "the pains compulsory, sufferings optional"

So it's been about 10hours since I posted this and honestly thank you so much everyone for all the support and comments. 

I'm not going to lie when I posted the previous post I was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped. 

I've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, I have now burnt. Which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but I wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much I scrub them. 

It felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, I've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. 

Her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that I cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and I just sent them the videos 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Now her family has pretty much disowned her which I feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly I couldn't care less.

I'm free, feeling a bit shit but I know I'll be happier and honestly if it wasn't for you guys I probably wouldn't be here. 

Thank you so much everyone, especially the dude that was talking about pasta 😂
