Worth remembering if you're having a bad day.
1. Your levels of norepinephrine, cortisol and adrenaline are off the charts. Your fear is a neurophysiological illusion, not a fair representation of the way things actually are.

2. Your anxiety is feeding on your fear. Why are you latching on to the thoughts you fear the most? What makes them feel more true than other, more neutral or pleasant thoughts? Contemplate for a couple of minutes.

3. Is your breathing shallow? Is your body feeling tense? Relax the body and take some deep breaths for a couple of minutes. Be mindful, and wait, with no fear. Remind yourself of the fact in point 1. Take note of the difference now.

4. Let out a deep bellylaugh at all this non-sense.
