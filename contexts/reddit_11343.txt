I’m ready to date, but I’m scared because of my last relationship
I want to try dating again, but I’m terrified of winding up in a relationship like my last one. My last relationship was not good, looking back on it, I was always pushed to the wayside. My ex and I would plan dates, usually on skype because we were long distance, and then at the last moment, she would tell me that her friends wanted to hang out and do X. This would’ve been fine if it were just a couple of times, but it would happen about 90% of the time. I get it, I really do, you want to hang out with your friends, but this is the issue: you can’t expect a relationship to last if you don’t put any time, care, or love into it. I mentioned it from time to time, and things would get better for a few days, then go right back to before, I was upset and sick of it, but I didn’t want to break it off because, “what if this is my one chance at love,” so I would bear with it. Then when I went to see her for a date we had planned for months, I traveled 100+ miles to go see her, and she bailed on me. I started to get fed up with it then, and then a few weeks later she called and broke up with me on the phone. A couple of months later, we started talking again, trying to make things work, and then things went on like that for a couple of years, talking on and off. Eventually I got fed up with it and told her that I never wanted to be in a relationship ever again, but the relationship itself left bad scars on my confidence, my sense of self worth, and my ability to open up to others in a romantic relationship. I’m scared that the same thing will happen again now with my future relationships, and I’m scared that maybe I’m not good enough
