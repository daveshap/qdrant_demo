BRENT: Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
TOM: The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
BRENT: She's my daughter, Tom.
TOM: So?
BRENT: So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
TOM: Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
