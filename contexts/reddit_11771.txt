I'm just kind of shit at everything
So yeah, the title pretty much sums it up. I'm shit at everything, or at least not very good at anything. Video games are my primary passion, and I've never been any good at them. Not horrendous, but never better than average. Drawing? I have no artistic talent, I've practised loads and never gotten anywhere. I can write academically, but my fiction is awful. I'm not unfit, and can perform in sports, but you wouldn't want me on your team. The only reason I played soccer as long as I did is my friends were compassionate enough to let me play with them. Programming? I'm not particularly logical anyway and despite it's what I want to do with my life I'm desperately mediocre at that too. Music? I've tried learning the guitar and the piano, never any good at either despite taking lessons for over a year with guitar, I can't sing for shit either. Warhammer? I like to play, have done for 4 years, can't paint for shit though. I just feel like I'm not good at anything.
