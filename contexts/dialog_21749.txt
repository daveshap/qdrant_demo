CAPTAIN: You killed him! Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!
SPARROW: No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
CAPTAIN: But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
SPARROW: No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
CAPTAIN: You lie!
SPARROW: It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue!
