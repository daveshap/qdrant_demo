TOYOTA: I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
NICKY: Everybody else does. Why not you?
TOYOTA: You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
NICKY: Oh yeah?
TOYOTA: Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars. Where's your white Lincoln limo?
NICKY: Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
TOYOTA: The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
NICKY: Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
TOYOTA: Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
NICKY: How come you got the kid with you?
TOYOTA: Matthew's my grandson.
NICKY: A grandmother. God bless you.
TOYOTA: He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
NICKY: It's the kid's lucky day.
TOYOTA: This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
NICKY: Now that's a complicated subject.
TOYOTA: That's a simple subject.
NICKY: Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.
