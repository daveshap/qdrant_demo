GUILD: This gun yours?
NICK: No.
GUILD: Who's is it?
NICK: I'll have to try to remember.
GUILD: Okay. There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better. Come on.
NORA: I wish that doctor'd come. How do you feel?
NICK: He'll be here. Give him time to get his trousers on. Where's Asta? Asta! Asta!
NICK: You're a fine watch dog.
NORA: He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
NICK: On it! I'm in it ... They think I did it!
NORA: Well, didn't you?
