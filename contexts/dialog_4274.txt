DULANEY: Yeah -- what are you doing up?
SHARON: We have to talk.
DULANEY: What's wrong?
SHARON: That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
DULANEY: Sharon, it's late. Can we get to the point?
SHARON: Where have you been?
DULANEY: Working. Charlie and I were going over some statements.
SHARON: Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. You were with her, weren't you?
DULANEY: Yes.
SHARON: Why did you lie to me?
DULANEY: Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
SHARON: This isn't a courtroom. Don't try to turn this around on me.
DULANEY: I'm not.
SHARON: You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
DULANEY: No.
SHARON: It's bad enough that you are. It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
