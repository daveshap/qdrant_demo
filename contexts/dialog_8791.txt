LANCELOT: Yield. I have the advantage.
ARTHUR: I will not.
ARTHUR: Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
LANCELOT: I sought only not to harm you, sir.
LANCELOT: Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
ARTHUR: So be it, to the death.
LANCELOT: It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.
