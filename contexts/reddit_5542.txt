How hard is it to learn basic Excel?
I really want an on-campus job that lists, among other things, a basic knowledge of Excel as a required skill. I don't really know how to use it, but I can generally pick up computer programs pretty easily, and I can always google. Is it a bad idea to apply for this job? (It's a research assistant position for a department, but I don't know how much research they'd actually be having me do; it seems almost more like an office assistant job).
