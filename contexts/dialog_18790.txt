SAUNDRA: What's the trick here ?
BRUCE: We drown.
SAUNDRA: Obviously, but what's the way out ?
BRUCE: Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
SAUNDRA: How long till the room fills ?
BRUCE: I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
