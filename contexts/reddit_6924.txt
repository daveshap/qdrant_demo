Getting Laid Off Soon! In Need of Career Advice!
Hi Reddit, I'll try to keep this short, but my buddy and I are looking for career advice, so I'll give you our situation and the options we are faced with. We've been at the company for about 6+ months, and we were told last month our branch will be closing next summer. I'm a fresh grad with 6+ months experience in the field, and my friend is a grad with way more years in the field. We were given 3 months pay severance packages, but told to stay until the layoff around early summer 2020, so neither of us should have trouble finding a new job, but when do we make our move? What's better, collect severance and keeping working, then find a new job when the field in more saturated or start looking now when the field is less saturated and rely on steady paycheck rather than a lump sum later?

**Variables of the situation:**

Our branch is closing when our local university graduates it's students resulting in my job applicants within our field during this time.

After our closure, we get a couple months pay, a bonus, along with a job hunt/outplacement service, but we have to stay with the dying company until it's closure.

We are currently in a season where the field is too heavy with new applicants, prompting us to look for jobs now, rather than wait.

Thanks for any help or advice in advanced!
