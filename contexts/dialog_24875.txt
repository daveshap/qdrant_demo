SID: Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
THEO: Tell your little pal to let go.
SID: Breeze, give him his ball back!
THEO: Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
BREEZE: Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
BREEZE: Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
THEO: It belonged to my dad.
THEO: Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
MILLIE: Who wants to know? Zeus!
THEO: I'm a bowler.
MILLIE: I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
