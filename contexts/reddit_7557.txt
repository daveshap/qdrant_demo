Great end to a stressful semester
Fall 2019 semester was definitely a stressful one. I just completed my 3rd semester in a STEM PhD program and I’m still recovering. My program requires us to TA a lab class in our 3rd semester. There was a lot of pre-runs and solution prep that had me working more than 20 hours a week to insure everything was ready for the class. I then took two class to fulfill my fellowship and program requirements. I then decided to take the qualifying exam (an oral exam that tests our in depth knowledge in our field). All of this plus extensive research experiments for my thesis project. I’m so happy I was able to pass all my classes and my exam and I’m making great progress in my research. 

PhD is hard and stressful but we can all do it and don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Hope everyone had a great semester as well.
