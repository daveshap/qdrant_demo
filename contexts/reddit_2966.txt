Does anybody else feel lonely in their office at work?
I recently started a new job and this is the first time I’ve had my own office. I’ve only ever worked in open air offices where I was sitting next to someone with another group sitting across from me. This made it really easy to bond with coworkers. However, at my new job, everyone else, unless they’re high up, have a cubicle or a shared office (really don’t understand why I have my own) so I don’t get to chit chat with them. This usually means I’m sitting by myself for hours without seeing another person. It’s kind of lonely. Does anybody have any tips with how to deal with this or can share their experience?
