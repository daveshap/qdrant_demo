How credible are "allegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government"?
CNN released an article on its website the title of which prominently took up nearly its entire front page, that "[Intel chiefs presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/donald-trump-intelligence-report-russia/index.html)".

CNN's report claims that there were also "allegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government, according to two national security officials."  Furthermore, according to CNN, "these same allegations about communications between the Trump campaign and the Russians, mentioned in classified briefings for congressional leaders last year, prompted then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid to send a letter to FBI Director Comey in October, in which he wrote, "It has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government -- a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States.""

Is there any way to validate CNN's findings, especially given the classified nature of the materials involved?
