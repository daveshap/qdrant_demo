She had a boyfriend the whole time.
Long story short, she(23) moved here from California about a year ago. I(20) met her 4 months ago(she asked for my number). We've literally done everything together for the first 3 months (only had sex once). Met some close family members and everything. But about a month ago she ignored a text (and I'm not the type to double text ever so I just let it happen) still hasn't texted back in a month. 

So yesterday I see her posting on her instagram story that shes with this unnamed guy and I thought it was a family member (because I stupid). Later on that day she posted on her feed something along the lines of "my honey bun came to visit me from California ‚ù§‚ù§" with a picture of her and the guy hugged up. She moved from California a year ago again.

The last time I've seen her was January 10th, its February 12th.

Now what's weird is that I'm not blocked or anything like that. Also I found out she has post notifications on for my story and she, without fail, is the first person to view what I'm doing within minutes on posting. 

Am I just the side chick who fills in when this guy isnt here üòÇüòÇ

Her and I have never talked about being in a relationship or any previous relationships ever. And I've never asked her to be my girlfriend 

(Heads up I'm not worried about loosing this girl, I already lost lmao, just curious what your take on this is)
