SETH: Who else?
JACOB: Pass.
SETH: Why not, against your religion?
JACOB: No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
SETH: Suit yourself, more for me. Scotty?
SETH: How 'bout you? You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine. Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
SCOTT: Okay, I'll have one.
