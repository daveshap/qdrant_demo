I can't prove it, but I think dating apps group less attractive people together when swiping.
I realize this is entirely an opinion because beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But at least for me, when I am swiping, eventually I'll get to a point where I literally swipe left through 50+ people in a row that I would classify as unattractive. 

When this happens, I actually start to say "when am I going to see someone attractive, what the hell?" Literally one after another. It must be how their algorithms group people. There is certainly not a "mix" of attractive and ugly people when I get to these groups. 

Does anyone know if this is actually the case? Thanks.
