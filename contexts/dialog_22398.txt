VINCENT: What the fuck happened?
SAM: I don't know...
VINCENT: You don't know? Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
SEAMUS: What in bloody hell is going on?
DEIRDRE: They're part of the team. One of them's the guy I told you about.
SEAMUS: From Interpol?
DEIRDRE: That's him.
VINCENT: Why didn't you kill her?
SEAMUS: Why didn't you kill him?
VINCENT: You slept with her!
SEAMUS: How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
