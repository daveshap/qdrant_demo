Why does living with depression just feel like a series of necessary distractions?
Every single damn day I have to find at least one thing to distract me from the fact that I want to die. 

I don't want to hurt.  I don't want to suffer. I don't want to take anyone with me in the process.

I don't want to fail at it and end up with some kind of neurological issue or permament physical injury. 

I don't want to hurt the ones who care about me, either.  Like my parents. I love them. 


But I am just so damn tired of living.  It would be so nice if I could just fall asleep and not wake up.  

How nice it must be to not have depression. To not want to die.  I can't imagine how nice it must be going a day without fighting my own self...
