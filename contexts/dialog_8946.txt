JACK: Stay off it.
FRANK: No, let's stay on it. I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig. He left a wife and two sons. He wasn't a hero. He was a fool.
JACK: You weren't there.
FRANK: That's right. I wasn't there. I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
JACK: Fuck you.
FRANK: No, fuck you. And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
