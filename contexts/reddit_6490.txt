Odd job listings in Chicago?
I’m not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I’m not sure where else to post. I have recently been applying for entry level marketing and editing positions in Chicago. Two companies I have heard back from are called Arrow & Atlas and Balance & Buzz.  Both companies emailed me in a similar fashion for a similar marketing assistant position. When I look on Glassdoor, there is nothing for either business. When I looked up the recruiters names on LinkedIn, I get nothing. There are websites for both, but they are vague at best. There is no other information on them except for these websites. Still, when I email with these companies, I’m talking to a real person who answers my questions. Is this a scam, or am I just paranoid?
