ROY: Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
BALLARD: I know that...
ROY: Well, do something, then, damnit!
BALLARD: You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
ROY: Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
BALLARD: No, I didn't have to.
MERCEDES: Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
ROSA: Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
