DEPUTY: As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
BRENT: No?
DEPUTY: Should we close down any eruption?
BRENT: Are you sure?
DEPUTY: We're seeing all the signs in town.
BRENT: I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
MISS DUNLOP: Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
JODY: Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
MISS DUNLOP: They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
JODY: Twenty eight years ago.
MISS DUNLOP: Follow me.
JODY: This place is empty.
MISS DUNLOP: Everyone's getting ready for the party.
JODY: You heard about that?
MISS DUNLOP: Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
JODY: Don't you think it's sick?
MISS DUNLOP: Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
JODY: You Miss Dunlop?
MISS DUNLOP: Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
JODY: No.
MISS DUNLOP: You're sweet. I really wish someone had thrown a party like that when I was your age. My life might have been very different.
