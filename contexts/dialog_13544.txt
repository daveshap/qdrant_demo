PRESIDENT: I could have evacuated the cities hours ago. You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
PRESIDENT: Any news on my wife?
GENERAL GREY: The helicopter never arrived at Nellis and there's been no radio contact.
