Why do jobs in America have a “at will” contract - what I mean, even in a corporate job, you can get fired at will and very quickly ?
I’m an American but i live in the UK and never worked in America but I’ve heard it’s very easy to lose jobs over there. Anyone know why that is? 

If I’m wrong in anything I said please correct me :)
