WILLIAM: I think you have forgotten... what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule. Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
MAX: That's not fair.
WILLIAM: No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
BELLA: Still loves you though.
WILLIAM: In a depressingly asexual way.
BELLA: I never fancied you much actually...
BELLA: I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny. But all that kissing my ears...
WILLIAM: Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
BELLA: Do you want to stay?
WILLIAM: Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
ANNA: Hi. Can I come in?
WILLIAM: Come in.
