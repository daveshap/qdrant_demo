TENZIN GYATSO: Did you love your husband, before you married?
TIBETAN WOMAN: I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
TENZIN GYATSO: Hmm.
TIBETAN WOMAN: The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
TENZIN GYATSO: Does he treat you fairly?
