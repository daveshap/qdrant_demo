CARLA JEAN: Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
BELL: You ain't heard from him?
CARLA JEAN: No I ain't.
BELL: Nothin'?
CARLA JEAN: Not word one.
BELL: Would you tell me if you had?
CARLA JEAN: Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
BELL: It's not me he's in trouble with.
CARLA JEAN: Who's he in trouble with then?
BELL: Some pretty bad people.
CARLA JEAN: Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
BELL: These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
CARLA JEAN: He won't neither. He never has.
BELL: I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
CARLA JEAN: He can take all comers.
