bruh. ik there are far more pressing issues rn but if i seriously have to stay in my toxic ass household for one more year and spend the first fall semester of college online i legitimately don’t know how I’m going to survive lmao.
it feels like a cruel joke I’ve been lookin forward to getting out of here for so long and just when i thought the waiting was over... i’m stuck in this hell of a place 24/7 and chances are i’ll have to remain here for awhile and ugh. the prospect of having to deal with this for one more year just terrifies me.
