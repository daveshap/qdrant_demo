Public Administration or Higher Education?
I just graduated in May '14 with a BS in Public Health.  I was offered a position before graduation as a student advisor for a new program.  Basically, this is a grant-funded program that allows students a different pathway to get a degree.  

I have loved this for the past 4 months and now I am thinking about continuing my education.  Since I work for a university, I can take three free classes per year at any state-system university.  I would like to work my way up to Associate/Assistant Director, VP, President, Vice-Chancellor, etc.  

I know that the Higher Education route would be best for this type of work, but it also severely limits me to only doing university work.  A Masters in Public Administration would be the most versatile, but I am not sure if a university would look at a MPA for those positions.  I thought the best thing to do would be to look at actual job postings and see what they say.  I found a range of things from just having any Masters Degree, a Masters in HE, to having specific Master degrees for the area that the departments deal with. 

Any advice or suggestions?
