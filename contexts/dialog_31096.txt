LULA: Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
SAILOR: What could I be up to, Lula?
LULA: He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
SAILOR: I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
LULA: That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
SAILOR: That was in Vietnam.
LULA: He's the kind liked it.
SAILOR: Lula, I got to get some sleep.
LULA: Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
SAILOR: What?
LULA: Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
SAILOR: Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
