LILA: No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?"
ROSE: Lila, it's Rosie.
LILA: Go the fuck away, Rosie.
ROSE: Please, honey, let me in.
LILA: Rose, please go away.
ROSE: Lila, I want to help you.
LILA: How'd you know where I was?
ROSE: Nathan told my brother.
LILA: Your brother should have his license revoked.
ROSE: Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
LILA: Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
ROSE: I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
LILA: Oh, Rosie.
ROSE: Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back. Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
