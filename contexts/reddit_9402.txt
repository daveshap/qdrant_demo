Six months ago I was 18 and homeless
For a while it felt like I'd never be safe again. Today I'm 19 with a place all to myself, food in my belly, and hope in my heart. It took a lot of doing to get here. Two jobs, days of searching for somewhere I could afford, trying to find places to stay so I could keep off the streets... 
I'm proud of how far I've come.


Things may seem impossible now, but you'll get through it.
