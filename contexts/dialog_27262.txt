STRUGHOLD: We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
WELL-MANICURED MAN: In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
STRUGHOLD: Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old. What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
WELL-MANICURED MAN: And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
STRUGHOLD: Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
