KASTLE: I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
KASTLE: See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
SHEILA: After we eat, Dad.
KASTLE: He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
JUNIOR: It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
SHEILA: Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
KASTLE: You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
SHEILA: That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
KASTLE: She ran away to be with that... that Motocross champion.
