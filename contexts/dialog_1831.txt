BUD: Marry Christmas.
FRAN: Thank you. I thought you were avoiding me.
BUD: What gave you that idea?
FRAN: In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
BUD: Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
FRAN: I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
BUD: I forgive you.
FRAN: You shouldn't.
BUD: You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
FRAN: Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
BUD: Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise. Cheers.
FRAN: Cheers.
BUD: One more?
FRAN: I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
BUD: You're so right.
BUD: By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order. Shall we join the natives?
FRAN: Why not? They seem friendly enough.
BUD: Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
FRAN: How many of those drinks did you have?
BUD: Three.
FRAN: I thought so.
