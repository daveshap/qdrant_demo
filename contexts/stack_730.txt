Ubuntu Restricted Extras Won't Work Ok, so, I installed Ubuntu-Restricted-Extras on Ubuntu version 16.04 LTS. I have all the updates. I used the terminal to install it because I couldn't find it in Ubuntu Software. But what I want to know is the Ubuntu Software Center, is Ubuntu Software and Ubuntu Software Center the same thing? Because if they are there is something wrong with mine, I can't install things like preload at all and flash player won't work (has it been removed?). In the Ubuntu Software app there are hardly any programs, and again, nothing like preload or Ubuntu restricted extras. Help me I am going bloody insane.
