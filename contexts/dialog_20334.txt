BOB: Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
SHIRLEY: That's life. My kisses are alive.
BOB: Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
BOB: All of my books are based on fact, or legend. Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.
SHIRLEY: Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight. I can't see a thing! Let's turn back.
BOB: There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
SHIRLEY: I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
BOB: Okay.
