I’m not sure what to do
I’m a male 15 and I have this friend from church. I had feelings for her since the 6th grade. I do somewhat have Christian morals. She’s been through a lot and she does drugs and she’s not a virgin. I’ve hated myself my whole life. Today was actually a really personal day. I spent the whole day with her usually me and her. She gave me my first kiss. Biggest problem is she wants to just be friends with benefits. She’s also bi, so that doesn’t help. I knew she was talking to some guy but I don’t think I deserve to get hurt like that. I did tell her that if she isn’t mine fully that I don’t even want to be around her because that shit’ll hurt me worse than how I am right now. I deeply care about her. If she gave me the chance I’m sure I could be there for her ways that no one else has. She doesn’t have the same feelings that I do ofc. I feel crazy when I think about her. Again she was my crush for 4 years and I never said a thing. Despite of all of those red flags I still love her. I just don’t want to be hurt. Right now I can’t stop thinking about her so I’m typing this at 3 AM
