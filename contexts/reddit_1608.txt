I was a B student in high school, did well at a state school for undergrad, and now I'm at MIT for a PhD
As a high school student, I definitely fit the bill of a depressed, unmotivated student wasting their potential. I would consistently show up late or occasionally skip school, and I only started working on assignments the night before they were due. I was in the IB programme, and my GPA was around a 3.1 with a handful of Cs and 2 Ds. I had a 1370 on my SAT which is good, but not incredible. At the end of my junior year, I realized that I was only setting myself up for failure in life and I wanted to start trying in school for once. I would go to places like collegeconfidential and feel like shit about myself because of my grades. Sites like these naturally attract the high achievers, which is fine, but it's demoralizing going online trying to get a better education and seeing peers list your reaches as safeties.

I ended up going to a state school for college (not going to name names for privacy reasons, but think Ohio State, Arizona State, etc.) and found a subject I was passionate about. More importantly, I found the motivation to work hard and go the extra mile because I was sick of not living up to my own expectations. 4 years later, and now I'm the first person from my department to ever attend MIT.

The reason I want to make this post is to tell the people who feel this way that you can still go on to do big things (even in school!) despite a mediocre high school GPA. If you have any questions you can comment or DM me.

I'd be happy to send proof to the mods if they want.
