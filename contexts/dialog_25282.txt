KIRK: Gillian... Would the whales be at sea by now?
GILLIAN: Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
KIRK: All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
GILLIAN: What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
KIRK: You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
GILLIAN: What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
KIRK: I have no time to argue, Gillian. Or even tell you how much you've meant to us... The <u>frequency</u>.
GILLIAN: All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
KIRK: Thank you. For everything. Beam me up, Scotty.
