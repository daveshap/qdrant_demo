GEORGE: She's swell.
MRS. BAILEY: Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
GEORGE: Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
MRS. BAILEY: Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
GEORGE: Uh-huh.
MRS. BAILEY: Came back three days ago.
GEORGE: Hmmmm . . .
MRS. BAILEY: Nice girl, Mary.
GEORGE: Hmmmm . . .
MRS. BAILEY: Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
GEORGE: Hmmm . . .
MRS. BAILEY: Oh, stop that grunting.
GEORGE: Hmmm . . .
MRS. BAILEY: Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
GEORGE: Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
MRS. BAILEY: Hmmm?
GEORGE: Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
MRS. BAILEY: Well, she's not crazy about him.
GEORGE: Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
MRS. BAILEY: No.
GEORGE: Well then, how do you know?
MRS. BAILEY: Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
GEORGE: Oh . . .
MRS. BAILEY: And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
GEORGE: And all's fair in love and war?
GEORGE: Mother, you know, I can see right through you –– right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
MRS. BAILEY: Uh-huh.
GEORGE: Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
MRS. BAILEY: Oh, George!
GEORGE: Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . This direction? Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
