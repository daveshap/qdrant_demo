Questions about gap year employment
Im currently a graduating senior and want to pursue a career in student affairs, but planned on taking a gap year before going to graduate school for higher ed. My plan is to work during my gap year but I had a couple of questions.

What types of jobs should I apply for and whatâ€™s the best time to apply for them?

How feasible is it to find a job for just a year and then enter grad school? (E.g., will a place want to higher someone for just a year?)
