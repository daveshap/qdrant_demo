DUFF: You heard me!
JOSIE: I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
DUFF: Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
REVEREND DAWSON: I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
DUFF: Don't look like there's a right way.
REVEREND DAWSON: Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
DUFF: It ain't in me.
REVEREND DAWSON: You'll be in trouble, son. Now just how do you intend to support your family?
DUFF: I guess I'll rob a bank.
REVEREND DAWSON: Don't you get smart with me, boy.
