REBA: Come on in. How about a gin and tonic?
DOLLARHYDE: Tonic will be fine.
REBA: In the kitchen.
DOLLARHYDE: How did you come to Gateway?
REBA: They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
DOLLARHYDE: You worked out well.
REBA: You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
REBA: I'll probably go back to it someday.
DOLLARHYDE: Uh-huh.
