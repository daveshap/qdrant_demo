CARTER: Secret Service Agent Carter. This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
LEE: We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
CARTER: They don't know that. What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview? I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings. You saw the way she was staring at me.
LEE: She never even looked at you.
CARTER: You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me. I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
LEE: I am not third world ugly. Women like me, they think I'm cute. Like Snoopy.
CARTER: Snoopy is about six inches taller than you. I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
