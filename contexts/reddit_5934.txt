I’m stressing out on what I should do in the future.
So i’m pretty much stuck on a limbo here. My passion is videography such as video editing, i have had temporary jobs then and there but have trouble getting a permanent job in that field.

I currently work casually as a kitchen hand, i do enjoy the environment, but it’s still a casual job. I could work part time, but the pay isn’t that great.

While I’ll continue doing what I love, i decided to go back studying on something that gives me a higher chance in getting a permanent job.

I’m thinking of studying tafe (technical school), most likely in business administration so i could get an office job. Do you have to be incredibly good in maths and communicating with people? 

I have a weakness in that i stumble my words alot and have anxiety, also i failed maths class in high school. When i go job searching, they always ask for people with good accuracy and strong communicating skills and I feel like I’m not up for it.

What’s your experience in admin or any other entry level office jobs? Should i study something else that’s more suitable for me?
