please help me
my friend has completely disappeared. i have no means of contacting any of her friends/family. she lives in a different state. she has made a suicide attempt in the past, but she seemed very happy the past few weeks. it's been 2 days since i've last heard from her. yes, she could be busy, without internet connection/phone. but, she never has disappeared like this before. what do i do? she's one of my best friends.
