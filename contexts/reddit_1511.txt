Reddit doesn’t understand anxiety
There was an r/askreddit post that got some popularity the other day that said “what instantly put your anxiety from 0 to 100?” And people said things like, when a cop gets behind me, or when I lose my wallet, or when they’re at their MILs house. And all of those things give me nerves, but they don’t compare to my anxiety. Things that give me anxiety? When I touch my phone charger and it feels warm so I don’t want to charge anything the rest of the day in case it catches fire. When I leave my house and wonder if I left the hair straightener on even though I always every day turn it off. It’s a habit. But I still wonder. When I stand up and my foot is numb and I go check the mirror to make sure my face isn’t sloping and my eyes aren’t dilated in case I’m having a stroke. I’m in my 20s and have no health problems. Driving, either riding or driving makes me anxious. These little things that never bothered me before now all of a sudden do. But just randomly. And that, to me, is what anxiety is. Sure, a cop driving behind me makes me nervous. But it’s not the same.
