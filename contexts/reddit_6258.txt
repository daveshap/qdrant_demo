Company made me an offer but the background check company has terrible reviews
The background check company that my potential employer uses has 70 1-star reviews on Yelp.

Reviewers say that they make harassing calls, steal identity, make people lose income for weeks by delaying background checks. Reviewers advise to not give any personal information to them.

They have 70 1-star reviews since 2014, and no other reviews, this pretty much means that this is deserved, and the are really bad. Otherwise, how to explain that 70 different people all said bad things?

What do I do? Do I still give my personal info to this company? I will have a job, but my identity would be stolen and some people I know would get harassed.
