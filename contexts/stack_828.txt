How to enter hexadecimal values from the extended ASCII table I am running Ubuntu 14.10, and I would like to enter characters from the console using hexadecimal code. To do this, I am using the combination Alt+ Shift+u+Hexcode. On my computer this works fine until Ascii character 127, but entering a value above will result in a character different from the extended Ascii table. For example, Alt +Shift+u+FF results in a y with two dots above. This is not the correct value from the ASCII table. I guess I need to configure my character set, but I don`t know how. I only found foreign sets like hyroglyphs. How can I ender ASCII characters from the extended Ascii set?Best regards,Thomas
