Should I get this this third master degree?
Hey,

I have a Bsc in communication (not my best decision in life), an Msc in management and an Msc in political science (that I'm finishing now). I'd like to extend and do an MBA in corporate finance because I'd like to work in investment and banking and create my own company eventually, but I'm afraid potential employers will see my three masters as a weird thing. But in the meantime, I don't want to be employed by whole life. I'm 25 and I would finish this MBA when I'd be 27. Also, I believe that this virus crisis has significantly decreased my chances to get a job, so I thought staying at school a bit longer wouldn't be a bad idea. I'm from Belgium so tuition fees here are not a problem.

Any advice?
