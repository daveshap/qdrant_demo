Was it wrong telling my friend that I like her boyfriend?
Before I share this story, I just want to let you all know that my intentions were to never hurt my friend or make her mad. Anyway, last week I told my friend that I like her boyfriend but I made it perfectly clear that I would never make a move on him, flirt with him, or do anything to get in between them because I respect their relationship. I thought it wasn’t a big deal to tell her and I didn’t know that she was going to react the way she did. So it turns out that she got mad, and she hates me now and she even told people which makes me upset because I thought that would be something that would just be between her and I. And many people are making a huge deal about it and are mad at me which is freaking me out because I never met to hurt anyone. Now I feel like I bad person and I just want to hear your guy’s opinion on this and maybe make me feel better about this situation because I can’t stop thinking about it. Thank you!
