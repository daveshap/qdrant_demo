JAKE: Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
REPORTER: Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
JAKE: You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight...
JOEY: He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
JAKE: I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
REPORTER: You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
JAKE: I tell you what. You hit me here. Sugar Ray hits me here. I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
VICKIE: Are you sure we should be doing this?
JAKE: Come over here.
VICKIE: You said never to touch you before a fight.
JAKE: If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
VICKIE: You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
JAKE: Come here.
JAKE: Take off my pants.
VICKIE: Jake...
JAKE: Do what I say.
JAKE: Now take the rest off.
VICKIE: Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
JAKE: Go 'head. Do it.
VICKIE: I like the gym smell.
JAKE: Now take your panties off.
JAKE: Now, touch me... ...here.
VICKIE: Oh, Jake.
