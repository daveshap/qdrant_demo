Resource required for learning simulations in physics I know basic programming in C and Fortran. I want to learn simple simulations in physics to have some idea about it. Right now I don't have any idea about it. Can someone refer some online/offline sources (at beginner level) from where I can have a clear understanding of what simulation means and how is it done? If there are beginner level textbooks on physics simulations please also refer. Right now as a beginner, I am not interested in specialized or research-level simulation techniques. Rather than simulation for basic textbook problems in classical or quantum mechanics, if possible. Since I don't have any understanding of what a simulation is I could not be more specific. Sorry about that.
