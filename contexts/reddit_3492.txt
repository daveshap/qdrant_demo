Feeling good I stood up for myself
So I matched with this girl on tinder and she seems attractive and nice. She goes to my university and we both want to go into the medical field. We talk for a week and it turns out were actually from the same background and lots of other similar interests. We make plans to grab drinks when things are safe again. She then asks me how tall I am and I tell her I'm 5' 8''. She hits me with the "....ya loooool that's a dealbreaker for me" because shes a little shorter than that in heels. I roll my eyes and tell myself I just wasted a week when I could've been studying. I've dated before and I realized that trying to date someone when you aren't their type is just gonna be a mess anyway so I wish her the best of luck with school and work. She replies to me anyways saying that we should keep talking bc height isn't THAT big of a dealbreaker. But I tell her I'm good anyway and that we should just go our own way.

I've dated in the past and I've come to realize that I'm not going to be a  perfect match for everyone, and that being single is ok. I also don't want to date someone wondering if I'm "good enough for her" the entire time.  I've done that before and it makes me toxic and insecure.

Ya, just wanted to get this off my chest. It feels bittersweet. I realize that I'm smart, fit, hardworking, good looking, albeit average height guy. Someone out there is right for me. But until then, back to studying!
