Do voters abandon politicians who reverse policy positions or "flip-flop"?
It's commonly accepted that being seen as a [flip-flopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_\(politics\)) is [bad for a candidate's electoral chances](https://theweek.com/speedreads/583116/hillary-clinton-flipflop-charge-im-progressive-but-im-progressive-who-likes-things-done).

But in actual fact, ["not all flip-flops are created equal. Voters take some of them in stride. Others are devastating."](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92426950)

[Research on the issue](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/702234) suggests that, in the age of Donald Trump, "when citizens evaluate a leader who has reversed, policy preferences will supersede any consideration of a flip-flop."

So, which is it? Is flip-flopping a guaranteed negative for a politician or doesn't it matter? What factors contribute to whether a candidate's reversal of position affects their electoral chances?
