After years of online dating, I deleted all the dating apps in early January and now I feel SO much better!
I’m a dating app veteran of about 4-5 years. Long story short, they didn’t work out for me at all. Constant ghosting, flaking, and games. However the “grass is greener” mentality of online dating may be the worse part.
I deleted everything the first week of January and I’ve been so much more happier and stress free. 
I’d like to encourage anyone who is suffering from online dating fatigue to delete all their dating profiles (even if just for a little while), and relax for a few weeks/months. Or... just quit all together and go about finding somebody in real life! The choice is yours.
