Online courses for tech skills
**also posted in r/csquestions**

Hi guys,

I'm looking to make a career change from finance to techâ€”roles relating to customer support, onboarding, documentation, or sales. Since I don't have a degree in anything tech related or any job experience in tech (however, I have significant experience in customer facing roles), I would love to take some online courses to be able to put on my resume and to get a working knowledge of the industry.  Are there any reputable online courses that you recommend for me to take? 

TIA
