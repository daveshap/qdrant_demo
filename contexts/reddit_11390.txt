I just worked a 14 hour day and I desperately wish I had someone to come home and cuddle
My job has me outside so as bundled up as I was I eventually started freezing. I miss the times when I could come home and crawl into bed and just hold someone, or be held. I had that with my ex who I dated for 5 years. I miss that, not her. It's a very lonely feeling.
