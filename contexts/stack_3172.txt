Story ID - Man forced to hunt to pay off debts Searching for a novel that I remember reading in college, but probably published a few years earlier (So the late 80's/early 90's timeframe). Details that I remember:Protagonist was enslaved to pay off debts or sent to prison planetEventually employed by family monopolyFamily plotted against each other for control/influenceJob was to hunt a dangerous animal on a specific planetEssentials had to be bought from family (increasing debt)IIRC the cover was either red or yellow, and had a picture of the protagonist in hunting gear.
