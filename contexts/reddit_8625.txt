Given the United States' for-profit healthcare system, how can Trump keep coverage for pre-existing conditions while still allowing insurance companies to profit?
Trump reported during his [60 Minutes interview](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-open-to-amending-obamacare-affordable-care-act/) that he would want to keep coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. This is something about which I am confused, as I previously was under the assumption that the mandate was the method by which insurance companies could remain profitable even while covering the most expensive individuals. I've attempted to search the internet for more specific policy points, but I've found little. By what method could a Republican health care plan cover pre-existing conditions without a mandate while keeping insurance companies profitable?
