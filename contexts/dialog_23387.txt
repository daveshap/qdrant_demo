NANCY: Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
MARY: Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
MARY: What have you done about Irving August?
GREGORY: Oh, I'm making investigations.
MARY: You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
GREGORY: Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
MARY: Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
GREGORY: There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
NANCY: Is it fifteen minutes yet?
MARY: No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
