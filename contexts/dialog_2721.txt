CAPTAIN O'REILLY: Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
RODERICK: I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
CAPTAIN O'REILLY: Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin. Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
RODERICK: Which O'Higgins do you know? For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
CAPTAIN O'REILLY: Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown. General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
RODERICK: Ah -- I see. No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
CAPTAIN O'REILLY: I have heard of them.
