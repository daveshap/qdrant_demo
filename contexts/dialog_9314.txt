DAMONE: You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
THE RAT: What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
DAMONE: It's definitely your mama.
THE RAT: Damone, you gotta listen to me.
DAMONE: All right... where did you see her?
THE RAT: She's in my biology class.
DAMONE: Did you get her number?
THE RAT: No.
DAMONE: Did you get her name?
THE RAT: No. It's too soon.
DAMONE: It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
THE RAT: Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
DAMONE: I would. Yeah.
THE RAT: Really?
DAMONE: I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
THE RAT: You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
DAMONE: Okay. Okay. Here's what you do.
