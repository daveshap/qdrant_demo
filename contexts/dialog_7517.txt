SONNY: The gun's right on your back...
MULVANEY: Give me the keys...
MULVANEY: What is it, Sam?
SAM: Everything's all right? You okay?
MULVANEY: Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.
SAM: You all right?
MULVANEY: Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
SAM: Yeah. Well, you're okay?
MULVANEY: Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
SAM: Okay.
MULVANEY: Thanks again, Sam.
SAM: I'm glad it's okay.
MULVANEY: It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.]
MULVANEY: For God's sake, will you please go now? We gave you every nickel we got.
SONNY: You're goin' outside with me. If there's no cops around, we just split. Otherwise, you go with us.
