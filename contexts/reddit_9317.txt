A small victory - I took my $450 tax return last year and put it into my savings. It's a year later and it's still there!
I've been trying to save money over the past year+some months. I basically paid all of my bills every pay cycle, made sure there was food; and anything leftover before receiving my next paycheck would go into my savings. Sometimes it was $50, other times it was $200+. When it came time for tax season last year, I vowed that I would put all of my return into my savings. In prior years, I'd look at my return and then decide on something expensive to buy myself instead of saving it, so last year was a big change. I just did my taxes two days ago and I'm getting $450 back again this year. When I take that same $450 and put it into my savings this year, it'll push my savings up to over $6,000. It's the most money I've ever saved by myself and I'm proud that I was able to change some of my spending habits.
