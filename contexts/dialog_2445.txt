STAN: How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
RYKO: I don't know.
STAN: What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
RYKO: Maybe I did... I don't remember.
STAN: I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
RYKO: Can you believe how perfect it fits?
STAN: Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
O'NEILL: Hey, you guys...
RICK: Who's your friend?
STAN: Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
RICK: Great. I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
