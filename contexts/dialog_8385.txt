THORFINN: Are you all right?
IVAR: No, I'm not.
THORFINN: You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
IVAR: How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
THORFINN: I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
IVAR: I know. I know.
THORFINN: Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
IVAR: Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I just feel ILL.
THORFINN: He used to puke in his sleep.
IVAR: Bastard.
