COULMIER: Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
ROYER-COLLARD: This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
COULMIER: Of course.
ROYER-COLLARD: It's a formality; truly.
COULMIER: You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
ROYER-COLLARD: I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
COULMIER: If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
ROYER-COLLARD: It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
