HANNAH: Are you in a bad mood?
ELLIOT: I don't know. Um...I'm just antsy.
HANNAH: Yes. I know. The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself. And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
ELLIOT: Was I?
HANNAH: Yes, you were. A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
ELLIOT: Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
HANNAH: Why not?
ELLIOT: Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
HANNAH: Why do you say that? Is there something wrong?
ELLIOT: I don't know.
HANNAH: Well, tell me. Should I be worried?
ELLIOT: But, you got four children!
HANNAH: I want one with you.
ELLIOT: Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
HANNAH: But what do, what do you-- what's that mean? W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
ELLIOT: You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured. A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut. I-it's all very...preconceived.
HANNAH: Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that. When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
ELLIOT: I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
ELLIOT: Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
HANNAH: Are you angry with me?
ELLIOT: No!
HANNAH: Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
ELLIOT: I didn't say that.
HANNAH: Are you in love with someone else?
ELLIOT: My God! Wha-what is this? The Gestapo? No.
HANNAH: Well, what? What, wh-what are you not telling me?
ELLIOT: What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes? I-I-I am disenchanted. I am in love with someone else.
HANNAH: Are you?
ELLIOT: No! But you keep asking these, these awful questions. My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
HANNAH: What, you, of c-- What are you talking about? Of course not. I'd be destroyed!
