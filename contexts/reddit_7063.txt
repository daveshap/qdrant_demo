How do I get hired
I got experience but I want to have another job. This one doesn’t pay much and to get a higher position someone has to die it seems. I tried applying to different places. I hear constantly of people saying “oh I got another job” like what the fuck. Why them, why never me when I work hard and all. How do they get jobs seemingly on a whim, while I can apply to 100+ jobs, and not even a call back.
