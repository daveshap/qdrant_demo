What legal consequences can a sitting POTUS be subject to if s/he engages in slander or libel?
[There was a recent post in this forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5xhbef/president_trump_has_accused_fmr_president_obama/) opening a discussion about Donald Trump's claims that Barack Obama while POTUS ordered a wiretap on Trump tower.

Developments since then:

[Marco Rubio](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/05/politics/marco-rubio-trump-obama-wiretap/index.html), who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was not sure to what Trump was referring.

[James Clapper](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/05/politics/clapper-trump-wiretap/index.html), who was Director of National Intelligence during the time in question, declared unequivocally that "For the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI, there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the President-elect at the time, or as a candidate, or against his campaign." 

[A spokesperson for Obama has declared](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/04/trump-accuses-obama-administration-wiretapping-trump-tower-phones.html) that "Neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false."

If this accusation turns out to be false, what would be the legal consequences for Donald Trump?  Can a sitting POTUS be subject to libel or slander lawsuits?  [This article](https://bol.bna.com/could-obama-sue-donald-trump-over-birther-conspiracy/) references potential lawsuits Obama as POTUS could have filed against Trump for the birther conspiracy, but it doesn't mention whether or not a POTUS can get sued for libel/slander.  Can anyone clarify?
