MRS. BOATWRIGHT: But, Charlie --
CHARLIE: NO! N-O, NO!
CHARLIE: I see you found what you was lookin' for.
MRS. BOATWRIGHT: I did look, Charlie, but I--
CHARLIE: No buts, Rita!
MRS. BOATWRIGHT: Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
CHARLIE: Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
MRS. BOATWRIGHT: You would do that, wouldn't you?
CHARLIE: You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.
