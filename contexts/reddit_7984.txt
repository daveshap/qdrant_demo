Is it ethical to be seeking other positions in case my transitional internship is cancelled?
My internship coordinator tells me that as of now, all internships are a go, but I want to know if it's unethical for me to be actively searching for other positions in the meantime? 

I'm moving states in approximately one month and would like to have a backup plan in case covid-19 stops my internship and makes me completely drain my savings before grad school begins
