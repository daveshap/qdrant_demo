JACK: Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
MAYA: No, we're paying for the wine.
JACK: I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
MAYA: Well, in that case...
STEPHANIE: What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
MILES: Exactement!
MAYA: I'm having the salmon.
MILES: That's what I'm having.
STEPHANIE: I'm thinking about the duck breast.
JACK: Me too.
