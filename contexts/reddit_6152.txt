Question about pre-employment drug test
I was offered and accepted a job, but have to take a pre employment drug screening, and attend a physical. 

The drug screening and physical are this Tuesday. And I am going to be at a small get together with some family.

When we are together we drink, not a huge amount, but we drink. 

My question is, if I drink at this get together am I going to have my offer rescinded?

I am from the US, Ohio specifically. Thanks in advance!
