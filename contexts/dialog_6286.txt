JAKE: And I think it's because of this redhead...
BUTCH: Know who I am, Jake?
JAKE: The Anti-Christ?
BUTCH: No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
BUTCH: Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
JAKE: Gee... What makes you say that?
BUTCH: Your life flashing before your eyes?
JAKE: Just the last three weeks.
BUTCH: That's not a bad place to start.
JAKE: I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
LIONEL: Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
JAKE: I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him!
LIONEL: I can't be here! You understand? I can't --
JAKE: Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
LIONEL: Oh Jesus!
JAKE: LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
LIONEL: What -- What do we do?
JAKE: Help me.
