Intimidated by the “business world”. Any tips/advice?

Ive been a meat cutter for the past 4 years. Currently at whole foods and pretty good at what I do.... But im about to graduate with a degree in accounting and analytics. Going to pursue a career in data science, and I just happened to see last night that my salary will be close to 100k a year... I make $15 an hour right now. 

Im used to punching in and punching out. Taking lunch. Having things that have to be done every single time you work. Im used to coming home covered in meat/fish. 
Idk how to prepare myself for the business world. Im used to structure, and dealing with customers. Im not a huge people person honestly and id rather deal with customers than have to maintain relationships with coworkers. I love data science though. And im really good at that too. Just nervous that Im not “mature enough” or whatever to work in a professional environment like that. Im moving to another state this summer, and applying for jobs this week. 
Has anyone had an experience like this? Was it difficult to adjust?
