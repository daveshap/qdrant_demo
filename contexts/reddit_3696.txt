As a guy, how do you know how physically attractive you are?
Just wondering if there's an easy way to tell how physically attractive you are. Personally I don't think I'm  good-looking. Not sure what can be done to make myself more attractive to girls. They have  rejected me/ have ignored my messages, which makes me feel as though they find me physically unattractive.

Any advice would be appreciated.
