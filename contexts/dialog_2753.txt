LIPNIK: ...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
LOU: Excellent picture.
LIPNIK: We got a treatment on it yet?
LOU: No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
LIPNIK: Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill. Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest? Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
LIPNIK: ...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
BARTON: ...Both maybe?
LOU: ...Maybe we should do a treatment.
LIPNIK: Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it. He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades. Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
