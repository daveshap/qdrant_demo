WES: What are we going to do!?
EPPS: We're going to keep driving.
JAEGER: They'll shoot us!
EPPS: We run they'll shoot us anyway. If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis. Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
JAEGER: They're not going to--
EPPS: It's the only way. We drive!
