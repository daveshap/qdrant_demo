NORA: Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house? Oh, it's you.
MACAULAY: Yes?
NICK: My wife.
MACAULAY: How do you do? What did you say?.... He is?.... Where is he? Very well. He's back in town.... Wynant. Thank heaven. He's waiting for me now. Forgive me, Mrs. Charles... but I've been so upset. It's no joke working for a man like that. I must be off. Goodbye.... Goodbye,
NICK: S'long.
