Since everyone else is posting it- here's what I'm doing to get ahead
I've mostly worked retail jobs and warehouse jobs- 5 years or so I worked in a public library system. I've never earned more than $13 an hour- not even in my library job or in my management roles. I got to go to community college for a couple semesters back when I was 18. My parents only wanted me to go to nursing school- some job appropriate for young ladies. Gag.

December 2018 I decided I was going to change everything. I studied my butt off, passed 36 CLEP credits. Enrolled in the BS in accounting program at WGU. Finished it in one 6 month term. Went right into the MAcc program, finished that in one term. Passed my final class last weekend.

Went from no degree to a graduate degree in one year of college and 4 months of CLEP.

I'm currently working as an accounting intern, still making $13 an hour.

Cross your fingers for me though- I have an interview in about 10 minutes for a job paying $50k salary with full benefits.

Edited to add: Well, I was too enthusiastic. Need to cut back on caffeine before interviews. I'll find out if I made the next round in a week or so.

I also feel obligated to add that I took the minimum loans out for this project and made myself finish in one term even though it was absolute hell to do so. I owe $8000 total for both degrees and my previous brief college stint.
