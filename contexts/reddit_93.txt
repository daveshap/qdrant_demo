Should I be annoyed?
I’m not sure if this is to personal for this, I don’t usually post on these a lot so I’m sorry if it is. I’ve had problems with this in the past with ex-friends and even sometimes random people but I’ve never really been affected as much as I have now as my supposed ‘best friend’ is the one doing it. I (f16) have never had a boyfriend and the most I’ve done with a guy is hold hands. One of my friends (f16) hasn’t even done that (not that that’s a huge deal but you get where I’m coming from) yet she still thinks it’s okay to judge me for not wanting to have sex yet and barely wanting to have my first kiss. Although in the beginning it was a lot more light hearted, lately she’s been a lot more blunt with that saying about how my boyfriend will be annoyed at me and implying that I’ll be a bad girlfriend. Am I overreacting or is this something to actually get annoyed at?
