What is the difference between the study of Evolutionary algorithm vs. Optimization? I have a course named \"Evolutionary Algorithm\". But, our teacher is always mentioning the word \"Optimization\" in his lectures.I am confused. Is he actually teaching Optimization? If yes, why is the name of the course not \"Optimization\"?What is the difference between the study of Evolutionary algorithm and Optimization?
