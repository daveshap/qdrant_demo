AUSTIN: Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag! They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
VANESSA: Sure.
AUSTIN: Do I make you horny?
VANESSA: What?
AUSTIN: Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
VANESSA: I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.
AUSTIN: Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.
VANESSA: I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever. If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
