BEAUMONT: Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
ORDELL: Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
BEAUMONT: What'd ya mean?
ORDELL: Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
BEAUMONT: What?
ORDELL: I need a favor.
BEAUMONT: That requires me goin' out tonight?
ORDELL: A bit.
BEAUMONT: Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
ORDELL: Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home. Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
BEAUMONT: What's the problem?
ORDELL: Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
BEAUMONT: Uh-huh.
ORDELL: I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
BEAUMONT: Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
ORDELL: Let me finish. Can I finish?
BEAUMONT: Go ahead.
