CATHERINE: You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
NOVAK: I did, yeah.
CATHERINE: You were right. There's a part of him that knows the truth. About what he did, about himself.
NOVAK: What about Julia?
CATHERINE: This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore. Not to him. He never finished her. The others...he was able to make them his.
NOVAK: You think you can do this, don't you?
CATHERINE: He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be redeemed.
NOVAK: This is Stargher we're talking about?
CATHERINE: Not Stargher, not really. He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster. And an innocent child. If I could reach the boy.
NOVAK: Whoa. Hold on. Aren't they the same guy?
CATHERINE: Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. We're all human.
NOVAK: It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like remorse.""
CATHERINE: Then what is he?
NOVAK: Evil.
CATHERINE: If you believe that.
NOVAK: Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
CATHERINE: What happened to Charles Gish?
CATHERINE: What happened?
NOVAK: What difference does it make...?
CATHERINE: Tell me.
