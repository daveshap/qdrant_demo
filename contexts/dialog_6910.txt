ALICE: But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats -- are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
MISS CALLAHAN: But you don't keep a cat, do you?
ALICE: We don't even like them, I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it. It was his first wife's favorite picture. She was an artist.
MISS CALLAHAN: I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
ALICE: Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday — about Oliver's first marriage — and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy — although he'll never realize it.
