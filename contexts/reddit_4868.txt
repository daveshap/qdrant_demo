My problems are ruining my relationships. (I’ve also realized that I really don’t like myself.)
Like a month ago I’ve met a girl and we’ve been texting every day since then.

She has a very good influence on me. 
My problems (stress, sadness, anxiety etc.) are getting easier to deal with thanks to her.

But feeling better naturally comes with worrying about losing this “goodness”... a lot...

I worry about losing her so much that it’s probably not having a very good impact on our relationship...


Even though I feel better that doesn’t mean I’m totally fine.

I still get these waves of [insert any of my problems here].

We very often argue when this happens.

I’m extremly worried that this will end up ruining my relationship with her.

She will not like me anymore if I keep having these waves...


Yesterday we were talking and she brought up how I have very low self-esteem. 

She wanted to help so she recommended something that has helped her with her self-esteem issues.

Go to a mirror and say “I love myself.”

I was almost unable to do this... I mean- I said it but I didn’t belive it and it made me feel way worse because I didn’t think it was THIS BAD...

Then I realized how much I don’t like myself...

I’ve felt like shit because of that since yesterday. (It’s getting better today, thankfully.)


She probably isn’t too happy about having to deal with me in these situations...


I’m not sure what to do... I really don’t want to lose her because of this...

I hope someone has some good advice for this...
