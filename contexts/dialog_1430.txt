JESSE: You almost ended my career before it began.
PINKERTON: Pity.
PINKERTON: How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
JESSE: Last February?
PINKERTON: Mmm.
JESSE: You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
PINKERTON: Yes?
JESSE: The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
PINKERTON: Damn.
JESSE: Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
PINKERTON: I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
JESSE: No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
PINKERTON: Oh. That's nice to know. We're going to hang you, you know.
JESSE: I figured.
PINKERTON: Was it worth it?
JESSE: Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
PINKERTON: That's what I would have done.
JESSE: I'm not hanged yet.
PINKERTON: You cocky little bastard.
JESSE: Ahh, you'll miss me.
PINKERTON: No, I'll hang you. But I may miss you just a bit.
RAINS: This is him.
PARKER: I remember you.
