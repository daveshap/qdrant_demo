A change of mind <br/>In my language we have an expression which literally translated is \u201cHe was born a fireman but died in a fire\u201d as a nice methaphor for a big shift in your way of thinking (like from conservative to reactionary). How would you say that in an elegant English?By the way, the original expression in Italian is Nacque pompiere ma mor\u00ec da incendiario (and you can say also the other way round).
