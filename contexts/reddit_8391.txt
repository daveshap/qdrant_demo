Is the "Trump Doctrine" a radical departure from the US's stance in international politics since WWII?
[CNN's Fareed Zakaria](http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2017/06/04/fareed-take-trump-dismantling-world-order-gps.cnn) recently declared the existence of a "Trump Doctrine" as defined by Gary Cohn and H.R. McMaster, that Trump has a "clear-eyed outlook that the world is not a 'global community' but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage."

Is Zakaria's assertion that this doctrine entails a dismantling of "the international order in the Western world since the end of WWII" valid?  Why or why not?
