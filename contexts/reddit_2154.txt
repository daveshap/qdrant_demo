If I get accepted to a top school, I can’t wait to flex on the people I hate
1. My former teacher who tried to convince my parents I’m special needs

2. My stupid math teacher who told me to calm down about my grades and who I constantly argued with

3. That dumb senior boy in math class who told me I’m better-suited to a state school and that I’m stupid for trying to go to a top school

4. Everyone who has ever condescendingly tried to convince me to go to my state school

If I get accepted someone good, I will flex so hard on all the people who doubted me and got in my way, especially my math teacher. My personal vendetta against her is one of my biggest motivators. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

Edit: To clarify, I am not special needs. My teacher knew full well I wasn’t special needs, but tried to convince my parents I was.
