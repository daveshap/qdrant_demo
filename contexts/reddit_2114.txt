My Life: A Comedic Tragedy
Johns Hopkins just called me after rejecting me ED. The AO confirmed my name over the phone then proceeded to ask me about my financial aid information. I replied: wait what? And she goes: you're a Maryland resident, right? As an Oregonian, my heart shattered once again. "I'm not," I replied. She ended the call by telling me she called the wrong student. If this isn't the cruelest thing I've experienced in the college admission process I don't know what is.
