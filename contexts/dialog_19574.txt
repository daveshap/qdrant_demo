GRADY: So, you live around here.
JESSE: Not too far. My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
GRADY: Elm Street? You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
JESSE: Yeah, why?
GRADY: Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
JESSE: What the hell are you talking about?
GRADY: They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years. That place is bad news. Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy. She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
