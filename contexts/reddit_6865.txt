Laid off and denied unemployment, where to look?
As the title says I found out that since I was only at my last job 2 weeks they can’t use that job for unemployment and since I left the previous job voluntarily I get nothing. I’m 3 weeks away from finishing my bachelors, I’m 30 with 3 kids and a good amount of restaurant and sales experience and am starting an MBA program in the Fall. And what  do you know, those are the two business getting hit the hardest and not hiring... I managed to secure a job as an agency recruiter but that’s where I got laid off from, and haven’t heard anything about them hiring me back. 

I spent most of my life savings being off work for 8 months prior to taking the agency job mostly cause one of my kids was sick and I couldn’t find the right job to start working again. Where am I suppose to look so that I don’t get corona and can make a decent wage? Seems like we’re just going to suffer as we ride this out.
