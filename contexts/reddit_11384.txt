A simple statement. A day ruined.
20M, sophomore in college.

I was just about to leave my physics lecture. The instructor talks about being safe since a lot of people seem to be getting sick. She says “stop kissing each other”. That’s all it took to throw me down a pit of depression and sadness. The people around me can relate with that statement, because being intimate while in college is normal. Relationships are normal. Not for me. I don’t have any experience with love and it ruins me. I’m not fucking kissing anyone. Never have. I’ve never done anything. Nearly all the people around me do though. I feel left behind. I feel unworthy. I feel like shite. My post history has more info if anyone cares. I’m sorry.
