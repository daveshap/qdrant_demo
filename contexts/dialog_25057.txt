HARRY: Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
STOSH: Stop it, Harry!
HARRY: Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
STOSH: Why do you do this to me every morning?
HARRY: Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
STOSH: I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
HARRY: Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
SCHULTZ: Good morning, Sefton.
SEFTON: Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
SCHULTZ: Fine -- fine!
SCHULTZ: Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here. Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
PRICE: Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
SCHULTZ: Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day. Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
STOSH: Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
SCHULTZ: Russian women prisoners?
HARRY: Jawohl!
SCHULTZ: Some are not bad at all.
STOSH: Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
SCHULTZ: Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
