Does anyone else bite their lips or inside of their mouth because of anxiety?
I’m always biting my lip especially at night when I’m trying to fall asleep sometimes causing it to bleed a little. Any tips on how to stop doing this? It causes red marks on my lip that I get insecure about but I just can’t stop. :/
