After seven years in college, I graduated yesterday!
It took longer than most but I did it! I remembered lurking on this subreddit a few months back and reading someone finishing their degree. I didn't think I'd make it this far, honestly. But that post gave me hope when I just wanted to runaway and hide from everyone.

The past 10 months had some of my worst anxiety moments in my life. So if you are reading this, please believe in yourself! You can do it! And do not be afraid to open up to people who matter. Believe in them believing in you.

Edit:
Hello! I just realized I basically ghosted everyone here. I came back to my hometown and was travelling.

I'm really thankful for the support from everyone in this community. I posted here so I that I may pay it forward - the old post gave me the push I needed when times were dark. Hopefully it can help anyone who is reading this also.

Being an irregular student does take a toll on you. Thoughts about being delayed made me feel embarrassed and ashamed. Oftentimes I felt alone and left out, group projects ended up being a solo thing for me and then I would think I wouldn't be able to finish it. When I enrolled on my last year, I had friends and relatives tell me they were excited that I was finally graduating. That expectation crippled me for a good portion of the year.

It wasn't because my family and friends weren't supportive - they were, they cheered me on. It was I that held me back. And I am glad I overcame my anxiety.

Thank you to this subreddit. It really does help to lift each other up. May we always give each other the boost we need!
