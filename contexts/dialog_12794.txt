BURNS: Exclusive? That's great.
HILDY: It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
BURNS: Never mind that. What's the story?
HILDY: Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
BURNS: You'll get it. Now what's the story? I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
HILDY: Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
BURNS: I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
HILDY: Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
HILDY: Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
BURNS: No kidding, Hildy. Say, this isn't a rib?
HILDY: No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
BURNS: That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
HILDY: It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
BURNS: Hold on a minute.
