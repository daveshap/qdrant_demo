HUNSECKER: I got that boy coming over here. What's so funny?
SIDNEY: With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
HUNSECKER: I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
SIDNEY: Can't hurt...
HUNSECKER: Can't hurt? I had to get him back his job.
SIDNEY: I like that, too. Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion. We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze. Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
HUNSECKER: But it's too late. I got him back the job...
SIDNEY: No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor! The manager yes, but not the boy.
HUNSECKER: Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
SIDNEY: Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
HUNSECKER: And who's feet is she on now?
SIDNEY: Presumably yours... That's according to St. Dallas.
HUNSECKER: What's this boy got that Susie likes?
SIDNEY: Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
HUNSECKER: What does that mean - integrity?
SIDNEY: A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match! It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's integrity"."
HUNSECKER: Full of beans, ain't you? But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
SIDNEY: Calculated risk. Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me. I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
