SIMON: To our assignment.
HELEN: What is it you need me to do?
SIMON: Helen, I want you to be my wife.
HELEN: I'm married!
SIMON: Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married. They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
HELEN: We're going to Paris?
SIMON: Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you. Can you get away? Just for two days.
HELEN: I don't know. I have to think...
SIMON: Here. Sit down. Be comfortable.
