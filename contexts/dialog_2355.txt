LANDON: Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
JAMIE: You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
LANDON: I don't want to be just your friend --
JAMIE: You don't know what you want --
LANDON: You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
JAMIE: And why would that scare me?
LANDON: Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
