POLICEMAN: We just found another body.
DEPUTY: Who's?
POLICEMAN: Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
DEPUTY: Jesus. Any word from Brent?
POLICEMAN: Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
DEPUTY: Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
POLICEMAN: Ok.
