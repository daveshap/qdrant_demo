TRAUTMAN: Hello, John.
RAMBO: Colonel.
TRAUTMAN: Mind if I sit down?
TRAUTMAN: I hear you're not enjoying it here.
RAMBO: I could take it or leave it.
TRAUTMAN: Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
RAMBO: Am I out of here?
TRAUTMAN: That depends on you. Christ, look at you. I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
RAMBO: There were treating me like a headcase.
TRAUTMAN: Hard to believe. You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken. No sense of humor. What did you expect? An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
