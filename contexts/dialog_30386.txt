BOYD: All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
FISHER: I'm calling the police.
BOYD: So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them. Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
BOYD: A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
MICHEAL: Not really, no.
BOYD: Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
