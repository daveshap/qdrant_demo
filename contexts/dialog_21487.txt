INIGO: No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
FEZZIK: -- what? --
INIGO: -- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
FEZZIK: -- where?
INIGO: To find the Man in Black, obviously.
FEZZIK: But you don't know where he is.
INIGO: Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
