Confused
How do I tell my boyfriend that I can’t forgive him. Yesterday he wasn’t happy with me and he wouldn’t tell me why(he does that a lot) and he said “f**k you” to me. He’s never done anything like that towards me and I told him it was okay because he apologized but I can’t forget it. Recently we’ve been fighting a lot and I really do love him and he loves me, he just doesn’t communicate enough. He’s always talking about things he wants to do when we’re together and sweet talking me but I just want to have a normal conversation instead of talking like that. What should I do?
