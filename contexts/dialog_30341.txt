MIDGE: Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
DOCTOR: It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
MIDGE: He won't talk.
DOCTOR: No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
MIDGE: I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
DOCTOR: Ah? That complicates the problem.
MIDGE: I'll give you another complication: he still is.
