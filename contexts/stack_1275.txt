130 PSI- Irrigation system, water line in house Had irrigation system installed 2 months ago. Due to location of meter and PRV, the POC was after PRV. After done was  told pressure too low even though static pressure was at 63psi, dynamic flow was 45-47psi.  Had plumber change POC before PRV and ran this in 1\" PEX from front of basement to rear basement and out to backflow. The house pressure is at 65 but the irrigation line is now 130psi.<br>Now irrigation guy said will need a pressure reducer at the valve box My main concern now is that I have a charged line running from front of basement to back of basement that is charged at 130psi.<br>     How concerned do I need to be?
