DAE feel like their anxiety was taught/acquired through traumatic experiences and the "real you" is completely opposite from the person your anxiety makes you?
For example, I can be really really anxious and unsure in social situations, but sometimes when I can overcome it, I find myself very easily and very confidently talking to people. It feels like that person is the "real me" who just gets smothered by uncertainty and anxiety.

As in, I don't think my personality is anxious or shy or unsure, but I so rarely get to see that part of myself because I'm constantly bogged down with anxieties.
