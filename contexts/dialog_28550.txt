THIN MAN: Couldn't help but overhearing. Two fine young people starting out on the road of life. I wish you the very best.
ALEXANDER: Thank you...
THIN MAN: I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
ALEXANDER: Sir...?
THIN MAN: And your jewelry too. I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
ALEXANDER: I don't understand.
