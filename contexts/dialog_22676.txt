MAGGIE: I'm going to kill myself.
PEGGY: Why?
MAGGIE: Because you think I'm all like... Hey man
PEGGY: No, I don't think you're like, I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you". Very hard to compete with. Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery."
MAGGIE: But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
PEGGY: No. I'm weird. Weird and mysterious are two different things.
MAGGIE: But I'm weird.
PEGGY: No. You're quirky. Quirky and weird are two different things.
MAGGIE: Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up. Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
PEGGY: I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up. But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids. And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
MAGGIE: I think you're right. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
PEGGY: Something that brings warmth to my heart. Duckbill platypus.
MAGGIE: It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
PEGGY: You're right. It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
MAGGIE: Thanks. Will you fix my hair?
