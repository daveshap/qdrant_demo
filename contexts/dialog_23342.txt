MRS. ACKERMAN: ...Browsing.
MOM: Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
MRS. ACKERMAN: I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
MOM: Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
MRS. ACKERMAN: NO! I could never hurt anyone!
MOM: That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
MRS. ACKERMAN: Yes, but I lent it...
MOM: And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
MRS. ACKERMAN: Yes... but... I didn't...
MOM: Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
MRS. ACKERMAN: No... I don't have room in my kitchen...
