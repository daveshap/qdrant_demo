I have two cellphones that are exactly the same, SIM card and all, and I make a call on one of them. What happens? Say I had a cellphone, let's call it cellphone A, and made a perfect copy of it - SIM card and all - and let's call this one cellphone B.If I were to call someone on cellphone A, what exactly would happen to both cellphone A and B?This stems from a short film I'm planning where a character goes back in time with his smartphone, and his younger self - that is now in the same time as him - makes a phone call.EDIT: This takes place in modern-day Australia, specifically Victoria. Also, the call from cellphone A is to emergency services.
