Isn't anxiety great when all you want to do is sit around because you're mentally exhausted but your brain convinces you that you're going to get cancer/heart disease/fucking every illness ever from not exercising
But you still don't exercise bc you're exhausted and have no motivation to do anything and then there's this endless cycle of beating yourself up? Absolutely love it.
