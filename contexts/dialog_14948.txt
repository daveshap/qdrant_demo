AMANDA: Well what?
PAUL: Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, itâ€™s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
AMANDA: This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
PAUL: That one time was just the bumper.
AMANDA: He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe. I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
