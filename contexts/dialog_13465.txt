BEN: We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
HAROLD: And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
BEN: -- Well what am I supposed to call you?
HAROLD: That's besides the point.
BEN: I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
HAROLD: Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
BEN: You know, dah--
BEN: Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
HAROLD: Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
BEN: Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
HAROLD: -- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
BEN: But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
HAROLD: -- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad? You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
BEN: -- What advice? You never --
HAROLD: That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
BEN: -- 73
HAROLD: -- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
BEN: But...
HAROLD: But what?
BEN: But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
