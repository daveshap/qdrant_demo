grandpa died yesterday, seeing my dad for the first time since
my dad's dad died yesterday. we knew it was coming for the past week. my dad was in a different country and just had to travel for more than 24 hours to get here. now i will see him for the first time and, i guess im just freaking out because, hes not a very expressive person
and
im not sure what to do or say. its harder than seeing a dead body, somehow...
