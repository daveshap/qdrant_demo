PENGUIN: Thanks. Jeez. Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
CATWOMAN: You're off the hook, Ozzie. But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
CATWOMAN: He napalmed my arm. He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
PENGUIN: Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
CATWOMAN: I want in. The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty. Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
