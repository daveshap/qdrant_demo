FOLEY: I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months. Soak the prison off me.
BUDDY: There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
FOLEY: Oh, man.
BUDDY: There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person. It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean? There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know? Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
FOLEY: I know exactly what you mean. It's just a feeling. You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
BUDDY: There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
FOLEY: Sounds great.
