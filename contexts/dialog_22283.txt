ADRIAN: ...Paulie. Stop now!
PAULIE: I want 'im outta here -- Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo? That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo! You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs! I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
ADRIAN: Only a pig would say that!
PAULIE: You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
ADRIAN: You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
PAULIE: I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
ADRIAN: Don't do that again!
PAULIE: Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
ADRIAN: Owe you what?
PAULIE: You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
ADRIAN: Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
PAULIE: You busted?!
ADRIAN: What?!
PAULIE: You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya! Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
