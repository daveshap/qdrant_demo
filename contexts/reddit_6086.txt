Should I take reduced hours/reduced pay?
My company is offering voluntary reduced hours due to COVID - 3 day work weeks for up to 4 months with pay reduced to 60%. Heath insurance and other benefits stay the same. Part of me looks at this as an opportunity to refresh and reflect, catch up on training and education goals. I'm in my mid 40's and have never taken a break from working since I was 15. The pay cut would have almost no effect on my bottom line - my wife works, we have no debt, we have a very healthy emergency savings account. After running the numbers, even with the cut I will earn more than I did 2 years ago. However, another part of me feels like this would be an irresponsible move.
