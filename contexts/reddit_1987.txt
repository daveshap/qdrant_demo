Ivy admissions are indistinguishable from a lottery
I'm a mod of a sub that commonly gets the same question repeatedly misdirected to our sub, so I thought I'd address it here: How hard is it to get into an Ivy?

The answer is that, for your purposes as an applicant, Ivy admissions are indistinguishable from a lottery.  Getting a 4.0, good test scores, and all those great ECs are the equivalent of buying the lottery ticket.  Once you've got your ticket, all you can do is hope your name gets pulled randomly out of a hat.  

It's not actually random, of course, but it might as well be for all the control and visibility you'll have into the process.  There are so many qualified students applying for so few seats, the admissions offices are making decisions on differences so thin that they could split an atom.  You don't know what those factors will be any given week, much less any other year.  And you'll never know why you did or didn't get selected.

So, if this is the world you want to be in, buy your ticket and don't hold your breath.  If you get in, congratulations, you won the lottery.  If you don't get in, it's not because you're not good enough, it's because you weren't lucky enough.

Happy applications, everyone.
