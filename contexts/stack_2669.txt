Adding a data dictionary to Trimble R1 reciever through ArcOnline I don't even know how to properly google this effectively, so maybe someone can help me on here. My company purchased a Trimble R1 GNSS Receiver. The data is managed through ArcOnline. I have a data dictionary that I need to use, but I can't figure out how I am supposed to upload it in ArcOnline. I have been creating Feature Layers to collect other data with generic data dictionaries - I use Field Notes Template currently. Is there a way to upload a data dictionary to ArcOnline to use with ArcGIS Collector on my phone?
