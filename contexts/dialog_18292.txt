MISCHA: This is one-way street. You go down the block to the middle.
MARIAN: This way?
MISCHA: Yeah. Not far. You will be fine. It's still day.
MARIAN: I see. How much?
MISCHA: Forty-five all total.
MARIAN: Forty-five? I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
MISCHA: Thirty is base price. Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
