JOE: I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
SUGAR: Looks like they're on the wrong track.
JOE: Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
SUGAR: It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
SUGAR: It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
JOE: Just regulation size. We have three like this.
SUGAR: Three?
JOE: Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
SUGAR: My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio. Which is the port and which is the starboard?
JOE: Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
SUGAR: Love it. Which way?
JOE: Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
SUGAR: Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
JOE: Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
