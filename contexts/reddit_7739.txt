Planning my future and teaching at the university level
Hey guys,

&#x200B;

I'm in the final stages of my 3.5-year-ish PhD, and will hopefully submit by spring. My dream is to teach at the university level, ideally in a position which is more teaching-focused than research-focused.

&#x200B;

I was able to supervise a few projects here and there, but my department is small and teaches in a non-native language so I don't have any experience lecturing or arranging seminars (I asked my supervisors each semester if I could help out, but they almost always didn't need my help). I'm keen to get more experience wherever possible though.

&#x200B;

I have two questions:

* What is usually the best route into teaching -- continuing with postdocs, accruing teaching experience on the side, and hoping a teaching position opens?
* If/when I apply for postdocs, should I make it clear in my applications that I'm very passionate about teaching?

Thanks for any advice.
