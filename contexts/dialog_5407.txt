CHUCK: There was a coffin?
KELLY: Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
CHUCK: What was inside?
KELLY: Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
CHUCK: That about sums it up.
KELLY: Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
CHUCK: The plane went down. My friends died. I washed up on an island. Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
KELLY: Yeah?
CHUCK: The tide came in, the tide went out. I survived. That's the headline. I survived.
KELLY: Don't overwhelm me with the details. You know how I hate that.
KELLY: Come on. Try.
CHUCK: Cliches, mainly. Don't take anyone for granted. Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
KELLY: So simple to say, so hard to do.
CHUCK: Not when you have no choice.
KELLY: You hated being alone. Couldn't stand it. Busy every minute. Always plugged into something.
CHUCK: I didn't know what really being alone was. No one back here does.
