WILL: What's the matter?
MAURA: Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
WILL: Oh come on...
MAURA: I just, I don't know...
WILL: What will Aubrey think?
MAURA: Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
WILL: Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it. She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
MAURA: You didn't think much about that before.
WILL: Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura. It's over. You know that.
MAURA: It's just going to take a while.
WILL: Whatever you say.
