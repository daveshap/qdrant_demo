JOHNNY: You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
TERRY: Listen, Johnny—
JOHNNY: Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
TERRY: You want to know somethin'—?
JOHNNY: I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
TERRY: You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros— —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing— Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
JOHNNY: Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
TERRY: I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad what I done!
JOHNNY: You ratted on us, Terry.
TERRY: From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
JOHNNY: Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
