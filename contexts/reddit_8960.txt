Is it possible for a United States president to be impeached for actions they committed prior to being elected?
[The twelve](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_impeachment) articles of impeachment are fairly open, and can be based on [high crimes and misdemeanors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_crimes_and_misdemeanors).

That being said, is there potential for a president elect to be effectively immediately impeached?

Would blatant lying during the campaign be considered "high crime" enough?


Who decides when an impeachment is applicable, and investigations began? I know the House of Representatives calls it to action and the Senate does the trial, but does the house require any sort of push?

**effectively I'm asking if the American public could petition for an impeachment proceedings to occur.**


Edit:  three words reads better than one.
