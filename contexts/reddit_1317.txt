I need to go to the gym to help with my anxiety but I can’t go to the gym because of my anxiety.
EDIT: Can I just say all of you are amazing and so incredibly supportive holy hell! You guys have given amazing suggestions and I’m happy to say I was given my correct meds today and will be hitting the gym tomorrow for my first day back! I’m nervous but you guys have been so encouraging I know I can do this. I wish I could hug all of you, and make all of you my gym buddies ♥️
