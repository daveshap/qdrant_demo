boost converter for ultra low power application I want to design a dc-dc boost converter and manage power (MPPT) for an ultra-low power fuel which contains input voltage &lt; 1 V and input current &lt; 500 uA.if I choose simple boost converter, I will have problem with inductor design because low input current (about 500 uA) will cause extremely high inductor.Here is the formula for calculating inductor for simple boost converter [L= (Vin*D)/(fs*0.3*iL)]I need to choose high freq and high L that means an inductor with more than 10 mH inductance and work in 5 MHz freq. (we don't have inductance in this spec)what should I do for power managing of this ultra-low fuel?
