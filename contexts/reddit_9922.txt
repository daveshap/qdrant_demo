Citing ACPA Professional Competencies
I'm trying to cite ACPA's Professional Competencies in one of my papers, but can't seem to find a date or any other information anywhere. I just have a PDF rubric on my computer that has the contributing writers, but no dates. 

I'm not sure how to cite them. Any help is greatly appreciated.
