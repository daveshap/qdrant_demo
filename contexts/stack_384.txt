Ctrl+R acting like holding space bar So I believe I've narrowed this down to a problem in Ubuntu or somewhere in software. Whenever I press Ctrl+R, it acts like I'm holding down the keyboard (i.e. typing tons of spaces). If I press the space bar, it stops.I first noticed it in PyCharm, however I've also reproduced it in gedit. Also, it's not the keyboard as I plugged in another one (into a different USB port) and the same behavior happens.I've tried updating ibus to 1.5.11 as suggested by PyCharm (however the problem was present both before and after the update). This didn't seem to change anything.Any ideas of what could be causing this?
