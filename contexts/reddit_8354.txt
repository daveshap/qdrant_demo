Does the new "third country" rule put forward by the Trump administration comply with US law and US treaty obligations?
This morning the Trump administration [published a regulation](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-15246.pdf) they plan to start implementing tomorrow which would require that:

>with limited exceptions, an alien who enters or attempts to enter the United States
across the southern border after failing to apply for protection in a third country outside the
alienâ€™s country of citizenship, nationality, or last lawful habitual residence through which the
alien transited en route to the United States is ineligible for asylum. 

In effect, this would mean that persons who claim asylum at ports of entry along the US/Mexico border and who are not Mexican citizens or residents will automatically be rejected.  

The ACLU has said that [they believe the rule to be "patently unlawful" and they plan to sue.](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-comment-new-trump-asylum-restrictions)

This action is unilateral, and without an agreement from any other countries.  President Jimmy Morales of Guatemala [pulled out of a meeting planned for today with President Trump](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/15/741769333/u-s-sets-new-asylum-rule-telling-potential-refugees-to-apply-elsewhere) where a safe third country agreement was to be discussed.

Currently the US has a "safe third country agreement" only with [Canada.](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/safe-third-country-agreement/final-text.html)
