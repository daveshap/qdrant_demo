FRANCES: Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
HARRY: Huh?
FRANCES: You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
HARRY: Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
FRANCES: I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
HARRY: Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
HARRY: There's just one more thing.
FRANCES: What's that?
HARRY: Will you marry me?
HARRY: It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.
FRANCES: Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
HARRY: You give up on her?
FRANCES: Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
HARRY: Frances, You're crazy.
FRANCES: I know. Don't tell anyone.
HARRY: Anyway... if you need me...
FRANCES: I got your number, Mister Man.
