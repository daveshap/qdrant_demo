I put $20 into my savings account today.
Hey /r/povertyfinance, 

I don't really have anyone to tell this to but you. 

This summer I had no car, a job barely above minimum wage that I hated (hotel front desk is not the ideal job, trust me), and almost no money. I was sleeping on a makeshift bed in my dad's living room. I saved everything I could, which was most of my income thanks to my dad covering the mortgage and most of the groceries (thank you, dad). 

This fall I moved out to go back to school and got an apartment with two friends off campus. I also got my first office job, an internship in software engineering. There was a gap of about a month between quitting my old job and starting my new one, and buying a car was the last of my money. I started the school year and my job with less than $50 to my name, plus a car loan for a few thousand and a maxed-out credit card, thankfully with a $500 limit. 

Now, 4 months later, I am making regular payments on my car loan and credit card, and can pay my bills on time. 

The reason I'm writing this is that I just put $20 into my savings account. I haven't had money that wasn't immediately needed for something since I moved in. It's almost surreal. 

I know it's a small step, but I'm making more than I'm losing.
