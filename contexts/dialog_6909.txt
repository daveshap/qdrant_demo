ALICE: What song, dear?
AMY: The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
ALICE: Oh, you'll remember it some time.
AMY: Mommy --
ALICE: Yes, darling.
AMY: Did you ever make a wish?
ALICE: Oh, lots of times.
AMY: Did your wishes ever come true?
ALICE: Sometimes.
AMY: I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
ALICE: Where did you get this ring?
AMY: That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
ALICE: But where did you get it, Amy?
AMY: At the old house with the voice.
ALICE: Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
AMY: On the back street — a green house
ALICE: The Farren house
AMY: Do you know the people?
ALICE: No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
AMY: Are they nice?
ALICE: I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
ALICE: Well — the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
AMY: I got my wish anyway.
ALICE: You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
AMY: But it's already come true.
ALICE: Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
EDWARD: Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
AMY: But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
EDWARD: You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
AMY: Will you come soon?
EDWARD: Soon as I finish.
AMY: You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
EDWARD: I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
AMY: That means I can go alone?
MISS CALLAHAN: Hello, Amy.
AMY: Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
MISS CALLAHAN: No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
AMY: I live right here.
MISS CALLAHAN: Maybe I'll drop in and see your Mommy.
