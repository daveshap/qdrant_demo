Looking to be a medical assistant
Greetings, I am about to graduate college and want to be an MA for a few years before applying to PA school. I am not a certified MA but have an EMT-B certification. I have seen that many people are able to get this position with an EMT-B certification so I began applying all around. Unfortunately, I have only received one call back. Do you think this is because of COVID-19 and the fact that I would need training to begin working and it's just not the right time? I am getting pretty upset but I don't want to give up. I have an excellent resume, I have been published in research, and I'm pretty sociable/outgoing, etc. I DEFINITELY didn't expect immediate callbacks (I am aware I am not a certified MA) but can someone just agree that it might just not be the right time to hire a person like me? I have patience and can wait until the fall/early next year just looking for some advice! thanks everyone :)
