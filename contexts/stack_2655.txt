How to turn a string field with 2 numbers in two numerical fields in the atribute table? I have a feature class with a big number of features. In the attribute table I have a string field made from two numbers separated by an underline (e.g.: 0_1, 98_237, 31_31...). I want to create two new numerical (long integer) fields with the numbers before and after the underline (e.g.: 0_1 0 1, 98_237 98 237, 31_31 31 31...)How can I do this using field calculator?
