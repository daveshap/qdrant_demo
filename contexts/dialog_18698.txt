MUMFORD: I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
GILROY: My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
GILROY: It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
MUMFORD: Do you want to come in?
GILROY: No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
MUMFORD: Mr. Gilroy --
MUMFORD: What brought this on?
GILROY: I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
