Is it possible to boot a 64 bit ISO image with a 32 bit Grub2? I'm trying to make a USB stick with multiple OSs installed however wanted it to run on most computers so I made sure to install a 32 bit Ubuntu version. I also want to put a specific ISO on the end and add it as a boot option but the distro only comes as 64 bit. I tried to start up the USB on a 64 bit computer (but 32 bit Grub2 from the Ubuntu install) and tried to boot the ISO (after messing with the grub config) and I ended up getting a kernal freak instantly. I was wondering if it could be because a 32 bit boot loader was trying to start a 64 bit OS or if it's even possible.
