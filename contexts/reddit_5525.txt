How do I become a personal assistant?
Hey all, I'll try to word this as best as I can. Currently I'm a cook, but I'd really like to leave the restaurant industry and do something else, hence the title. Honestly I'd even like something related to it like admin work, I just have no idea how to get started, what kind of classes I should take, etc. I'm not looking to become wealthy or anything, I just want to live instead of just survive, if that makes any sense. Any and all help is appreciated, thank you! I live in the southeast of that makes a difference? I know some places work different than others.
