AMBER: Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
IRIS: Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
AMBER: But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
IRIS: Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
AMBER: This, this... This is bullshit!
IRIS: Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
AMBER: Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
