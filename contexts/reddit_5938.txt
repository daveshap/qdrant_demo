What kind of jobs can I get with the type of degree I have?
I graduated with a bachelors of science in international relations and psychology minoring in holistic medicine. I’ve spent a lot of my working life working as a teacher with preschoolers but I actually want to use my degree and do something that can push me into a better pay grade. What can I do? 

Are there certifications that could help boost my degree to make me look more appealing to employers? I’d like to find a new job by June 10 of next year.
