Applying Bayesian Gaussian movement question I have a question from my stats class that I am confused about how to proceed with. I have a general idea of what I am to do but I am not sure how to start.The question is about a car that is moving on a road. It's beginning position is b, and b is normally distributed ~N(0,6). At b the car drives around, the distance the car drives is d with d~N(0,5). If d is positive, the car went up. Otherwise it moves to the down. Given that b and d are statistically independent and the car's final location is 6 or c = 6 (c being the final placement of the car). Find the most likely location b or where the car first began moving.From what I understand, c=6 is just an observation and we are to find P(b|d=6) with b ~N(0,6) and d~(0,5), maximizing for the probability that d = 6. But I'm not sure how to proceed from that.
