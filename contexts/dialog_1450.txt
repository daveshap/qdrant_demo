COURTNEY: Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.

BATEMAN: Lucky, I guess.
CARRUTHERS: That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?

CARRUTHERS: It looks so soft.

OWEN: Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
BATEMAN: I've been great. And you?
