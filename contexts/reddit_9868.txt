Can I count my experience as related work experience?
Hello r/studentaffairs community,
I am looking to break into the student affairs field, but I am hoping for some advice/guidance from some knowledgeable folks. I am applying for anything and everything at the colleges and universities in my area with the goal of working in academic advising, ideally.

I graduated with a BS in sociology with a minor in organizational leadership in summer 2017. Following my graduation, I worked unsuccessfully in several unrelated jobs for about 2 months each, and found that none of them fit me. 

A year ago I took a job working in hospitality so that I could move to the area where I wanted to live. If I'm being completely honest, I had no idea what I wanted to do in my career, and after working successfully in a field that does not fulfill me, I've realized student affairs is for me.

During my undergraduate career I was involved in orientation, Greek life, student conduct board, and leadership in several other capacities. I worked as a student assistant in the President's office and completed two internships. This is a very simplified summary of my involvement and undergraduate experience. 

Now for the actual questions:
1. Does my undergraduate experience count as the "one or more years of related work experience" that most of the jobs I've found require?
2. How can I frame my experience, relevant and irrelevant, as a selling point in applications and interviews?
3. Should I be applying for the academic advising/registrar jobs that I'm hoping for or start smaller?

I appreciate this community and thank you all for any advice you may give.
