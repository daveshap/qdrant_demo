She told me she loved me!
I've \[19M\] been seeing a girl \[18F\] for around 2 months, and this morning, before we had to go about our day, we were lying there, and she was looking into my eyes, and muttered quietly. I asked her what she said, and she kept smiling and couldn't say it. I knew what she was going to say, we both did, and eventually she said the words! I returned the phrase, and we both smiled at each other.

Just wanted to write this here to make a note so I can remember this moment <3
