CLARICE: Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this William Rubin"
DR. LECTER: Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
CLARICE: I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
DR. LECTER: I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
CLARICE: Then tell me how.
DR. LECTER: First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?

CLARICE: Later, listen, I'll -
DR. LECTER: I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
CLARICE: And - one morning I just - ran away...
DR. LECTER: Not just

CLARICE: I heard a strange sound...
DR. LECTER: What was it?
