YU: Mu Bai...It's been too long.
LI: It has. How's business?
YU: Good. And how are you?
LI: Fine.
YU: Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain. He said you were practicing deep meditation.
LI: Yes.
YU: The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you. My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
LI: I left the training early.
YU: Why? You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
LI: During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared. I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
YU: You were enlightened?
LI: No. I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment. Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow. I couldn't bear it. I broke off my meditation. I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
YU: What was it?
LI: Something I can't let go of. You are leaving soon?
YU: We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
LI: Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
YU: The Green Destiny Sword? You're giving it to Sir Te?
LI: I am. He has always been our greatest protector.
YU: I don't understand. How can you part with it? It has always been with you.
LI: Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
YU: You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
LI: It's time for me to leave it behind.
YU: So what will you do now?
YU: Come with me to Peking. You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
LI: First I must visit my master's grave. It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet to avenge his death. And yet I'm thinking of quitting. I must pray for his forgiveness.
YU: Join me once you have finished. I can wait for you in Peking.
LI: Perhaps.
