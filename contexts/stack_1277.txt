What is required clearance from mechanical exhaust to garage door? I'm looking to add a new tankless water heater, which allows for pvc exhaust.In California, USA, I think clearance requirements for a door is four feet horizontally or one foot vertically. Does this also apply to garage doors?What clearance is required by code from this exhaust to garage door?I see the required clearances from the manufacturer but many of them say refer to local building codes.
