JASON: Okay... Okay, now what.
BRANDON: Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility. The bowels of the ship.
BRANDON: Commander, do you have a camera? I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.

BRANDON: Okay, so do you see a door marked CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left."
JASON: Yes...?
BRANDON: Okay, that's where you want to be.
