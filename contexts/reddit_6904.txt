How to discuss recent redundancy in job interviews and with Recruiters?
27 year old male, working in sales in the SaaS industry.   Unfortunately my company just made me redundant before Christmas and my contract is due to end on the 15th January.  The reason for the redundancy is that the bigger organisation we are part of were not happy with how our entity was performing - therefore some people were let go, with the Sales department being the main target. 

In terms of job applications, I know the drill and just to focus on my strengths in my CV and Cover Letter - no need to mention the redundancy.   When it comes to the interviews however, and conversations with Recruiters, I could do with some casual guidance.

My plan is to just be like ''Yeah there was some restructuring going on due to the recent acquisition by the bigger organisation, and this restructuring included some job losses''....... and then to turn the conversation back into the new job which I'm applying for, how it excites me, and what I can bring to the table.

I would however appreciate some further pointers and advice from people who have been in this situation before, or who may have some good ideas.
