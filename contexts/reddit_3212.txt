People who struggled to choose a career, how did you eventually decide?
I have no clue what to do, finished college with sub par grades and don’t know what to do about university. I just am clueless about what I want to be. Is just experiencing different fields the best? Any help or advice would be great!

Update: Thanks for all the advice and stories they’ve been really useful to me and I hope this post will help anyone else stuck about their career path. I think I’m set on doing a film and media production degree. I can do it with my grades and I can’t think of anything I’d rather do.
