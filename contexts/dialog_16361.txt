OTIS: I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
SAM: And that was the last time you saw him?
OTIS: Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
SAM: That was the night he disappeared?
OTIS: Could of been. That was white people's business.
SAM: And when my father was Sheriff?
OTIS: What about it?
SAM: What was your deal with him?
OTIS: Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side. Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
SAM: He ever accept cash for a favor?
