FOLEY: That's funny, Adele. How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
ADELE: Till it's not funny any more. What do you want, Jack?
FOLEY: You know that Super Bowl party? They changed the date. It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
ADELE: Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
FOLEY: I said not as a rule.
ADELE: So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
FOLEY: Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth. Out there in the free world.
ADELE: What's free about it? I'm looking for work.
FOLEY: What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
ADELE: Emil the Amazing. The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes. How's this sound--
FOLEY: Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now. So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
ADELE: And the one driving the other car?
FOLEY: What're you talking about?
ADELE: Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two. He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
FOLEY: Glenn Michaels.
ADELE: Yeah, that's him. Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
FOLEY: He did, huh. Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em. I might not even take 'em off first.
