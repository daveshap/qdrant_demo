When did companies get so stingy?
I recently got hired for a part time job. I'm scheduled for 20 hours a week. My boss comes up to my last pay period and says you have to be careful with your time, you went over by 15 minutes (for two weeks since we get paid bi weekly). He was nice about it, but I was just surprised this was such a big deal. This wasn't 15 minutes of over time mind you, this was 15 minutes on top of the 20 hours. This is not a mom and pop shop, this is a fortune 500 company. Has anyone encountered this? Are companies all like this now a days?
