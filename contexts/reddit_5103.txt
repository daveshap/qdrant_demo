Received rejection letter for a job that was opened for me?
Hello

I received a rejection letter for a job that the hiring manager and team opened up for me to fill. I was once employed there with a different department, and when I left the hiring manager of the current opening has been trying to get me back. 

I was told by an existing employee that HR is preventing the hiring manager from viewing candidates until they refine their list. When I received the rejection letter, my counterpart and reference for the job notified the director.

Can HR still interview me despite being initially “rejected”?
