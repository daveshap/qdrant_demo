Dating apps would be vey different if people were honest
Imagine a world where people were honest in the dating apps, after reading so many post and using my own experience I've realized that these apps lack this important aspect

\-Be honest on what are the reasons why you are on this app. If someone is looking for a one-nigh stand he should find someone who is also looking for that instead of playing with other's emotions

\-Be honest and tell me that you are just looking for attention

\-Tell me that you are not feeling it instead of just ghosting me

\-Instead of slowly pulling away just tell me that you are not that into me

\-State that you are also dating other people early on
