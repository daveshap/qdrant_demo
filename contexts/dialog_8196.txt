DEAN: Where's Stacy?
JENNY: She doesn't want to talk to you.
DEAN: What are you talking--
JENNY: She can't talk to you right now.
DEAN: Why?
JENNY: Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
DEAN: Stacy?
STACY: How could you let me find out like this?
DEAN: Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
STACY: Robert--
DEAN: It's not true.
STACY: Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--"
DEAN: I've seen it.
STACY: At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks.""
DEAN: Yeah...look--
STACY: You <u>swore</u>!
DEAN: I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
STACY: I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
DEAN: I know.
STACY: You had an affair with this woman, Robert, we went to a fucking <u>counselor</u> for a year.
DEAN: I see her for business.
STACY: You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
DEAN: I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
STACY: The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
DEAN: It's not real... That's not me.
STACY: Oh, please--
DEAN: It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
STACY: I think you should leave now, Robert.
DEAN: Stacy--
STACY: Leave this house.
