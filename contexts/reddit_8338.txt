Is the request to delay tax bill until the newly elected Senator from Alabama is confirmed in line with typical procedure or out of line?
Democrats are calling for a delay on the Republicans' tax bill until the newly elected (Dem) senator from Alabama is confirmed.

In 2010 when Democrats were in control of the Senate and Republicans got Scott Brown elected they demanded that progress on the Affordable Care Act be delayed until Scott Brown was seated. This delay occurred.  
 
Was the delay because of the Republican request or was it due to some other reason(s)? **And more importantly is that how things have worked in the Senate historically?**
