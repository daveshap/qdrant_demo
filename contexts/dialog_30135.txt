WW: I... I... think I'm... shot.
MUNNY: You ain't shot.
WW: P-p-p-please, I'm not armed. M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
MUNNY: You sure you ain't armed?
WW: I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
MUNNY: A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
WW: B-b-books. You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
MUNNY: Yeah.
WW: Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
MUNNY: Huh?
WW: Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
MUNNY: Yeah?
