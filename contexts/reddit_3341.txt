If you can’t take 3 months without dating you have a problem
I’m seeing far too many posts on this sub about people going crazy because they aren’t able to meet up with people. Even worse I’m seeing people break lockdown to go on dates. This isn’t normal behaviour. You’d rather get a virus than be single for a few months? Maybe you should take this time to consider why you’re afraid of your company.
