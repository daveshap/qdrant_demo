GENE: Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
PLATO: No, sir. I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it. I guess I'm just no good?
GENE: What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
PLATO: I don't know. End up in the electric chair?
GENE: Where did you get the gun?
PLATO: In my mother's drawer.
NEGRO WOMAN: She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
GENE: Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
