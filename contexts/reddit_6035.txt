Have an in person interview tomorrow, masks are required. What type of mask is appropriate?
A little back story, had an interview with a small fragrance company back in Februar. They wanted to bring me in for a  second interview in March but was canceled because of COVID. Been in contact with them through out and have stated they are still interested in bringing me in, well I finally got the call for my second interview set up for tomorrow morning. 

Since it's in person they are requiring mask, my question I only have a cloth mask with print on it marvel comics characters on it. Is that appropriate for the interview?
