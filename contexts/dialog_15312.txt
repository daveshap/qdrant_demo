BREE: All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper -- Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
