Grad Program that Offers Assistantship with Veteran Student Services
Hi /r/studentaffairs!!!

I'm hoping someone here can point me in the right direction? It's getting to that time of year where I'm looking at graduate schools to get my MEd. I would love to go to school in the south, (preferably a state that is not land locked), or in Washington state. However, the biggest criteria is that the program offers an assistantship with the school's student veteran programs. 

My interest in working with veteran students came on an epiphany when I was working my school's summer orientation program and I was with transfer students and one of them happened to be a vet. For once, I was dumbfounded about not knowing of any resources for this student.

I've found only one school, University of Texas at Austin, that has an assistantship with their Vet Programs. Any other suggestions on schools I should check out would be greatly appreciated. Even if it's not within the location I mentioned.

Thanks for the help in advance!
