Creating evenly spaced grid for QGIS composer to show overlap in Map? I would like to create an evenly spaced, overlapping grid so that I can use the QGIS ATLAS to display a large mapping extent with a little bit of overlap between each image of the Composer. I am working in QGIS 2.18.14 and have not been able to figure this one out. I have tried using the 'Grids for Atlas' Plug-in but it does not give the option to set a uniform Extent when using its dynamic grid option.
