HOLLY: I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
APRIL: Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week. I'm real low on money.
HOLLY: Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
APRIL: Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
HOLLY: What?
APRIL: Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera. I didn't know what to say.
HOLLY: You're joking.
APRIL: No, he called late last night.
HOLLY: I, uh, I'm very surprised.
APRIL: He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
HOLLY: And you, you-you're going?
APRIL: Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it. He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
HOLLY: But I'm seeing him.
APRIL: I know. I said that, but... he said it was something he really felt like doing.
HOLLY: Gee, um... I...I don't know what to say.
APRIL: Look, it's just an evening at the opera. Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
