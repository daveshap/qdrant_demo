The UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has defended the potential deportation of grooming gang members with dual-citizenship back to Pakistan, stripping them of their UK citizenship.

Has the UK or other countries deported criminals with dual citizenship? If they have, under what circumstances? Has something like the grooming gang scandal occurred elsewhere?

Some context on the grooming gang scandal:

[Child grooming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming) is befriending and establishing an emotional connection with a child, and sometimes the family, to lower the child's inhibitions with the objective of [sexual abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse). Child grooming is also regularly used to lure minors into various illicit businesses such as [child trafficking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour), [child prostitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prostitution), or the production of [child pornography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography).

[The Rotherham scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal), wherein around 1,400 children ages 11-16 were sexually abused primarily by British-Pakistani men, while the authorities failed to act.

[The Telford scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telford_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal), up to 1,000 children were abused in similar circumstances, with some murders as well.
