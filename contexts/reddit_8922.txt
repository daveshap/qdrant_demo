What alternatives for a fair redistribution of districting have been proposed to counter gerrymandering?
[Gerrymandering has been cited](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-divides-congress-20161011-snap-story.html) as one of the reasons why Trump rose to prominence in this election cycle. [There are numerous examples of extreme gerrymandering in action in numerous states.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/05/15/americas-most-gerrymandered-congressional-districts/)


Have there been any proposals for countering this extreme gerrymandering with the purpose of creating a fair redistricting structure? Within which level of government (federal, state) do these changes need to be made?
