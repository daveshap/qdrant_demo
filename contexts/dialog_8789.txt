MERLIN: A king must marry, after all.
ARTHUR: ...of course...
ARTHUR: I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
MERLIN: There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
ARTHUR: Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
MERLIN: Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
ARTHUR: Guenevere...
MERLIN: You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind.
