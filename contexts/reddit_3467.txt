You win some you lose some
I finally cut things off with a girl I’ve been talking to. For the time it was great, she was funny, smart and we had similar interests. But there were noticeable red flags that popped up along the way. Those including; constantly talking about their ex, saying they were hard to handle and crazy, admitting they were clingy, inconsistent communication etc. Cutting this off was hard, emotionally I really liked her and saw myself hanging out with her after quarantine. But when I took a step back and evaluated the situation, I knew that the relationship wouldn’t work out. This is the first time I’ve done this, I feel like it’s an important step forward to future dating success.
