SIMON: I admire them.
NORMAN: I do, too.
WAYNE: But how can you say that?
SIMON: They're mesmerising.
NORMAN: Hypnotizing.
SIMON: Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
WAYNE: Yes.
NORMAN: Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
WAYNE: Yes.
SIMON: Through the power of the simple word---
NORMAN: And a snake-eye glare.
SIMON: ---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
NORMAN: He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
SIMON: He had the edge. The mind's edge.
NORMAN: Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
SIMON: Only on a much grander scale.
NORMAN: They've hypnotized the nation.
SIMON: Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
