Can't get hired because I have no experience; can't get experience because I can't get hired. Advice for newly graduated writer?
My first real post! Let's go. I'm desperate. **HELP!**

I just graduated in December '19 with my BA in English-Writing. I'm F, 26. Was going to go into education, but for a multitude of reasons, instead of teaching English I decided I wanted to *write*. I love to write anything. Poetry, creepy short stories, proposals, memos, academic materials and research...ANYTHING. I love the process and its really the only thing I'm good at. BUT. I have worked in customer service for 10 freaking years. I've lived w/ my SO since I was 19 and had to always work to pay bills, so unpaid internships were never an option. I had to take breaks between semesters because I couldn't afford to take time off of work to take classes. It's been a struggle bus to the finish line, but I graduated with a 3.8 GPA so that's cool. But now I have no experience in WRITING. Just customer service and restaurant experience. My portfolio is a few academic essays that I want to eventually get published, but that is about it. I have no real "published" samples to send with job applications, no real "office setting" experience because those jobs are Mon-Fri and I was in school, and no internship experience. All my counselors keep telling me is to "get a masters and you could teach", "you have the GPA for masters", "publish your academic work", yadada...I NEED REAL ADVICE. I could just go back to customer service, but I want to be in my field and making more than minimum wage, cause, ya know, STUDENT LOANS?

What was your first real writing job? What did you put on your resume? Did you freelance? Tutor? Is being a journalist a real option? HELP. And thanks in advance.

**TLDR;** Writers, what entry level jobs would help me in my career of being a writer?

\[Note: I'm not trying to write novels. Technical writing, content creation, and satirical work (think Onion) are fields I'm most interested in.\]

**EDIT:** Thanks to everyone for taking the time to respond! Seems like the majority say "freelance", which is what I plan to pursue now. Lots of people have provided some great sources for that and good starting points. And others have suggested other entry level positions that I can use to widen my job search. This helped a lot and I have a clearer path in mind. <3
