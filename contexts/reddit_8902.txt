The Democratic Party in Maine essentially abolished superdelegates recently. Why was this done, and is it a policy the entire party should adopt?
Several days ago, the state Democratic Party in Maine [voted to adjust the state partyâ€™s constitution to bind superdelegates to caucus results]( http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/279194-maine-democrats-vote-to-bind-superdelegates-beginning-in-2020), essentially eliminating them as an independent bloc. The resolution also encouraged the national party to do the same. 

According to the linked article, the change is an effort to make the nomination process more democratic, and to give younger, less influential voters more power over a process currently dominated by entrenched party elites. However, [others point out]( http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/mar/22/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-superdelegates-never/) that superdelegates are rarely the deciding factor in a nomination, and that a bloc disconnected from the popular voting process act as an important counter to momentary populist movements that may nominate politicians that are not viable in the general election.

It should be noted that the Republican Party [also makes use of superdelegates in its nomination process]( http://www.bustle.com/articles/141611-does-the-gop-have-superdelegates-the-republican-partys-nomination-rules-are-different-this-year), though they are much smaller in number and autonomy than their Democratic counterparts. 

**What are the pros and cons of a nomination process involving superdelegates?**

**Should the DNC follow the example of Maine and nationally abolish superdelegates? What about the RNC?**
