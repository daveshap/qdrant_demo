How do I tell the family I've been babysitting for that I need to be getting paid more then $25 a day?
Originally posted somewhere else but it got taken down and said I should post here. So please help me out. 

I babysit for this family. They have a 3 year old who I love to death. I've known the mom ever since I was little because my parents are friends with hers. The mom is 23 now. She WAS a single parent when she first needed me to babysit back in September. And now she is married. They are both cops that work in the jails. 

When she first needed me she was a single mom and I told her to pay me as much as she could and she told me she could only do $25 a day (she only needs me Saturday and sunday). So I was okay with it because that's all she could afford. I originally would start at 12:45 PM and go till 9:30 -10 pm and then she started to need me earlier. From 12:45, 12:30, 12:00, 11:30 am, 11am, and sometimes to 10am.

She ended up getting more serious with her boyfriend and he moved in so I ended up getting off around 7 PM. Now they're married so they have two incomes coming in. Their schedules got changed so now they both work from 5:30 am to 2pm, so they need me to come over at 4:45am till 3 PM. 

I did the math for how much im getting paid by the hour and it's around $2.72. I live with my boyfriend now, and with the whole coronavirus this is my only source of income since the other family I baby sat for doesn't need me any more.  I'm not sure if I should tell her I need to be getting paid more and I'm not sure how to tell her especially because when I needed to be paid in advance she did that for me and gave me $150. I ended up almost working all the days off for it, but she recently just told me that she decided to forget about it and started paying me again, so now I'd feel bad If I told her I need to be paid more

(Sorry if the grammar is bad. I'm tired of retyping thing lol)
