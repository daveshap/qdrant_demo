JACK: Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
MILES: I want to go home now.
JACK: You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
MILES: Is she bringing him to the wedding?
JACK: What do you think?
MILES: You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
JACK: Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
MILES: I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
JACK: No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
MILES: You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
