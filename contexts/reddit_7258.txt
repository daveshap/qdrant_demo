When is it acceptable to ask for more work?
Hi all! 

I began my job about a month and a half ago and it’s going well. I’ve had a few hiccups here and there with easily fixed mistakes. My job has a 6 month probation period which is fine. 

My boss is really hands off. She showed me a bit of the ropes my first few days and I was off to the races. If I have questions, I learn as I go or basically teach myself. The biggest hurdle for me is learning the process of how things are done.  

The problem is..... I get bored! There’s been a lot of times where I’m sitting at my desk *finding* things to do and making it up as I go along. My workload isn’t enough, I could easily handle double of what I’ve been given. 

When is it appropriate to ask for more responsibilities or tasks to do?
