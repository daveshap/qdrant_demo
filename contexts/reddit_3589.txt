Please please take no for an answer.
I went out with someone on a virtual FaceTime date. He was not my type at all, but I had a good conversation with him for like two hours, then ended. Told him immediately after that I wasn't interested in being romantic, but maybe we could be friends. He says he's not interested in that and asks for another chance. I say no, talk to him about it, and then he accepts...

...Until I wake up to a three-page text message from him asking for me to give him a shot, how I deserve his love, etc. I finally just coldly say I'm not interested and block his number. I am 26 and he is 30 so it's not like we were fucking 16, where that kind of behavior is more normal!!!!

I feel so creeped out and nervous I ~~got a stalker!!!!~~ **will have a stalker based on his behavior.** Anyone dating, please take no for an answer the first time!!!! ESPECIALLY if you're out of college, you should know better. If someone says no, accept it. You won't change their mind, and if they want to be with you, they'll fucking message you!!!!

**Edit:** Getting a lot of responses, including DMs from angry men. Chill out, stop sending me stuff about how I'm so awful, and go outside. Here are some things.

**Dating Time:** Some guys are saying that I "shouldn't have given him so much time." My rule with first dates is to always give the person two hours, in case they're nervous, it takes us some time to get our legs, etc.

A lot of guys have messaged me to say that that's not okay, I should know immediately. Uh, **do you get mad at guys who fuck girls on the first date and then ignore them after? No, you don't, and why is that?**

If you're upset that someone would talk to you more on a FIRST DATE to make certain that you're not a good fit, **you are not ready to date people.**

**Attitudes: I've been rejected plenty of times when dating.** It doesn't matter who you are or what you look like. Sometimes, the person doesn't feel chemistry, they liked you but didn't like X or Y, etc. When I was 24, I was severely underweight due to an ED, and a lot of guys I met stopped finding my body attractive. If you are not ready to experience rejection, **you are not ready to date people.**

**The Guy:** He was attractive enough in pictures and over video, but something about him put me off. He seemed to develop romantic obsessions with girls and also mentioned he had a personality disorder and was going off of his meds because he didn't think he needed them any longer. I offered friendship and a clear no after for safety, because I didn't want to offend him and risk my own personal safety. Anyway, I wasn't intellectually or emotionally connecting with him, and I wasn't attracted enough to want to have sex (not that I do that.) Something about him was so creepy.

**Accepting "No" For an Answer:** When I broke up with my last boyfriend, he wrote me a long e-mail asking me to stay. That was fine, as we'd been in a long relationship, and I responded. On first dates, you're just getting to know someone. You should accept what the other person wants. Ours was a first date and a video chat, and I told him that I didn't feel romantic interest in him immediately after our date. He didn't accept it, so I even took the time to tell him over the phone the specific reasons I did not want to date him. He didn't accept it again, so I gave him a briefer "no." After that, he sent me a letter expressing that he deserved a chance.

**Contents of the Letter:** The only reason I am sending it over DM is because I don't want him to somehow find this post (slim chance, but weirder things have happened!) In the letter, he told me that while he didn't "need my love" and had "plenty of options," I should give him a chance because I said I was attracted to him (I did not) and because he felt we had a connection. I should give him the chance **of a relationship** because he thought I was special, and because I am young enough so that my time doesn't matter/I can afford to go out with people I'm not sure about.

**Freedom to send the letter:** I would never show anyone the letter my last boyfriend sent me, because we were in a relationship. If someone I'd been dating for six months sent me the letter, I would not either. If you're going to send a letter that creepy and controlling to someone you **barely know**, you are taking the risk that other people, including police officers and therapists, will see it. **You are also probably not ready to date people.**

**Rejection:**

# As a final note, all of these angry messages have been about how I made him feel bad, and how terrible I am for it. Well, did you even consider how he made me feel? Did you? This was not a good or fun experience for me.

# I feel nervous and upset, and scared about re-entering the world of online dating. I feel nervous about meeting people in person, I feel nervous about saying "no" openly albeit politely again, and I feel like my choices won't matter to people I'm going out with.

If YOU don't care about the feelings of girls you're going out with, **you are 100% not ready to date people.**
