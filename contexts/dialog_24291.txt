STARLA: What are you doing?
GRANT: You're pretty.
GRANT: Who's that?
STARLA: It's just one of my students, Grant.
TREVOR: What's she see in that douchebag?
BILL: That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
MARGARET: Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
TREVOR: Gold--digger, huh?
