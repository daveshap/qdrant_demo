HARRY: Whose is the car?
VALENTIN: Mine.
HARRY: Nah. You're driving it too carefully.
VALENTIN: Maybe I just bought it.
HARRY: Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
HARRY: Havanas. You're not the smoker. So who is?
VALENTIN: You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour. I work for the best illusionist in the world.
HARRY: Philip Swann?
VALENTIN: You know of him?
HARRY: I saw him in Vegas once.
VALENTIN: Are you a gambling man?
HARRY: When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
VALENTIN: Never call him that. He's strictly an illusionist.
HARRY: What's the difference?
VALENTIN: Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
HARRY: Any movie stars buried here?
VALENTIN: Probably.
HARRY: It's not a bad place. Warm. Great view.
VALENTIN: I don't think the dead much care.
HARRY: Are you sure?
VALENTIN: Are you a believer, then?
