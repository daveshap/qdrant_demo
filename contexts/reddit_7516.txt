Any good graduate programs in probability theory?
I’m currently a junior undergraduate very interested in probability theory, but less so in statistics.

I’ve heard there’s countless statistics graduate programs in the US, but what about probability?  I can’t seem to find many programs online that offer a program solely for the subject.

Ive prepared the rest of my maths degree around the subject, taking undergraduate probability theory I-III, graduate real analysis I-III, and next year I’m planning on taking measure theory based probability I-II for some serious conditioning for graduate school.  

However, if this path is only going to lead me to admissions in a statistics program (I love statistical theory, but data analysis is literally hell), I’d rather reconsider.

Thanks.
