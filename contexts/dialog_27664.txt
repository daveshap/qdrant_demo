LYDIA: I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
MITCH: I had to acknowledge a delivery. Mother, I'd like you to meet...
LYDIA: A what?
MITCH: Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
LYDIA: How do you do, Miss Daniels? Acknowledge a what?
MITCH: A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
LYDIA: Oh. I see.
MITCH: For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
LYDIA: Across at Brinkmeyer's.
MITCH: Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
MITCH: After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
MELANIE: I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
LYDIA: You did say birds?
MITCH: Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
LYDIA: Lovebirds, I see.
MITCH: ...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
MELANIE: Yes, but...
MITCH: You are, aren't you?
MELANIE: Certainly, but...
MITCH: Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
LYDIA: Seven o'clock, same as usual.
MITCH: I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
MELANIE: With... with Annie, of course.
MITCH: Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
MELANIE: Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
MITCH: You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
MELANIE: I'm sure.
MITCH: Seven o'clock then.
MELANIE: Maybe.
