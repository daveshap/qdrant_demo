GRANT: Looks like the sea, at dawn.
MICHAELS: We're safe -- long as it remains that color... We're in the Pleural Sac. It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
GRANT: Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
MICHAELS: His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
GRANT: Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
MICHAELS: Sabotage? I don't understand...
GRANT: I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
MICHAELS: You have no right to blame Duval --
GRANT: That line was tampered with...
MICHAELS: I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
GRANT: You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
MICHAELS: I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
GRANT: Two in a row?
MICHAELS: It's possible --
GRANT: Thirty-two minutes left... But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
OWENS' VOICE: Look at those Walls up ahead!
