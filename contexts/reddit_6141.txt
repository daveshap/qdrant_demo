Tips for new hire starting work from home?
I am 2 weeks into my first job at an MNC fresh out of university. 

While I count my blessings to be able to find a job during this period, I’ve been working from home since day 1 and it poses quite a bit of ambiguity. For example, I can’t read my colleagues/manager’s tone over the chat so the social anxiety in me is slightly freaking out. In addition, the other newcomer in the same role has 4 years of experience whereas I am the only fresh grad in the team. 

I also can’t socialise with them WFH so it’s hard to build relationships with the team.

Would love to hear any tips for this situation or just new hire/first job related ones! Thanks.
