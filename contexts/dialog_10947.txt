NARCISSUS: Very fancy. Did you design the bottle?
SELENE: Who else? I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome! Or for the glory of you!
NARCISSUS: I'm a soldier -- we're at war. I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
SELENE: We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
NARCISSUS: I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
SELENE: Let him trust Quintus.
NARCISSUS: Quintus is overly idealistic.
SELENE: I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
NARCISSUS: Me? Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
SELENE: I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
NARCISSUS: What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
