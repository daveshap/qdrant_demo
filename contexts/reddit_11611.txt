My sister never uses her laptop
So me and my sister both have computers. The thing is, she never uses her own. She is constantly using mine because she complains that her computer doesn't receive wi-fi too well. Sure, I let her borrow it from time to time, but sometimes when I'm using it, she'll ask to use it for an hour or something to: play music, talk with her boyfriend over Skype, watch a movie. And sometimes I'm like "Sure." I do something else, and then when I come back to her, she is browsing the internet. I'm like wtf, give me it back if you're done with it, and she is like "Just one more second." Just recently she asked to use it to Skype with her friend for an hour, and I really just wanted to relax and use it, so I said no. She doesn't care, she keeps begging, making accusations that I never do anything for her, saying she won't do any favors for me. Then SHE gets super upset with me. I'm feeling extremely guilty right now, but I also feel like I made a sensible move. I just hate how she begs, gets super upset, and then makes me feel guilty or uses tricks to try and give her my laptop when she has her own. I'm sure it isn't completely unusable, and honestly if she wants to use a better computer she should just get a job and save money to get one (she is 21). I really just want to know if I'm doing the right thing, I don't want to be a douche bag but Ive had it up to here with this.
