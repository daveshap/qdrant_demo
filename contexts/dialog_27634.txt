ELDRIDGE: Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
PETE: I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out. I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
SAUNDERS: Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
PETE: I already have.
SAUNDERS: Who?
PETE: My girlfriend. If she still is...
SAUNDERS: Would that be Miss Sinclair?
PETE: No. No, not Miss Sinclair. I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
