Access Ubuntu Server from other network via Filezilla? Just want to apologize in advance if this is a obvious question, or I leave anything out. I have tried searching for the answer on my own but couldn't find what I was looking for so came hereSo basically, the other day I made an Ubuntu server to host a website.I am using FileZilla to SSH into my server and edit files to develop my site.I'm working on this project with a mate who lives in a different area, and I was wondering if I could set it up so that he could access my server via FileZilla?Thanks in advance, Bryn.
