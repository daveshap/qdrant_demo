JAKE: I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
NIKI: What do you care about?
JAKE: I care about my daughter.
NIKI: You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
RUCKER: You working in San Diego now?
NIKI: I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
RUCKER: 'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
NIKI: Was he with a girl?
RUCKER: No.
NIKI: Thanks.
