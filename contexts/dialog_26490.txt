LENNY: You think he'll find us.
LEX: Never. But we have to hide out for a while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
LENNY: Lucky I brought my drums.
LEX: But . . . how could you beat him?
SUPERMAN: High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
LEX: But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
SUPERMAN: No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
