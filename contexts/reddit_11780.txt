Jack of all trades, master of nothing: I'm okay at like everything I do, and don't want to abandon anything, but I'm not like, exceptional at anything.
When I was younger, I learned to play the piano, got good enough to impress people, then picked up guitar, did the same, then drawing, then writing, then a ton of other things. 

I love creating art. Just the simple act of creating things makes me happy. But I see people all around me who are piano virtuosos, having their screenplays adapted into films, having their art displayed in galleries, and here I am, with a shit-ton of mediocre work. It's diverse, but truly mediocre. 

What do I do? I know I can't be a master of everything, but I can't bring myself to abandon anything. There aren't enough hours in a day, and this damn website sucks up so many of them.

I just realized this. Like, a few days ago. I lived my whole life thinking I was great because I'm kind of okay at a lot of different things. Now I know that it's not how life works. A two ton pile of shit, no matter how large, is still nothing compared to a little teeny diamond. 

Anyone out there feel me?
