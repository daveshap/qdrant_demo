Does subsidizing birth control (or specific types of birth control) decrease "welfare" costs?
I see this often [subsidizing birth control is fiscally conservatve] (https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/03/the-fiscal-conservatives-case-for-spending-more-money-on-birth-control/254442/) as it reduces the cost of "welfare" (for lack of a better term) on the back end. Where less women get pregnant because they have access to birth control they could not afford and therefore have less kids that "cost the system less" 

[while I have seen some arguments that providing birth control reduces unwanted pregnancy I often haven't seen the decrease in costs to welfare attached to it] (http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/02/free-long-acting-birth-control-cuts-teen-pregnancy-abortions.html) 

[here is a national review paper countering many of the the points in the earlier articles mentioned] (http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/385884/no-one-program-did-not-reduce-colorados-teen-pregnancy-rate-40-percent-callie-gable)

I guess my qeustion is. Does subsidizing birth control (or specific types of birth control) actually decrease "Welfare" costs. Not just reduce pregnancies (which many articles focus on) but decrease the costs in welfare. I'd love to see if it does but I can't find any studies proving one way or the other.
