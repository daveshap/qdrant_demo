DAVID: Excuse me, are there any more claims?
HOLLY: Only a few. A few. Do you like 'em?
DAVID: I can't resist.
HOLLY: Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs?
DAVID: Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong.
HOLLY: We're actresses.
DAVID: Is this your first job?
HOLLY: Really? Is the food that bad?
DAVID: Oh no. Not at all.
APRIL: We need more bread and some baked lasa-- uh, lasagne. Hi.
DAVID: I know. You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
APRIL: Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's. I do the, uh, crÃªpes caviar.
DAVID: And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
APRIL: Well, let's hope so.
HOLLY: Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
DAVID: Ah! HOLLY Now.
