JACK: Whoa, why are we getting off?
MILES: I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
JACK: What?
MILES: I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
JACK: Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
MILES: It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
JACK: How old's she going to be?
MILES: Um... seventy... something.
JACK: That's a good age.
