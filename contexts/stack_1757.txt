270v DC current limiting circuit I have looked through some of the current limiting responses, but don\u2019t see any close to what I\u2019m working on for my project.I have an EV system running in around 200 - 270V DC. I want to build a circuit that will allow me to connect an external say 280V DC LiPeO4 battery bank and charge up the internal DC system. Obviously, I don\u2019t want to dump the total current possible when the circuit is made. I have a Gigavac high voltage relay that can make the circuit.I want something that will limit the charge to say 20A at 270V DC to the internal battery system to \u2018top it up\u2019 in real time. I\u2019m an engineer but more in thermal/mechanical with some electrical background, but not in ICs or design.Any help is appreciated, but remember to keep it simple (e.g. pretend I\u2019m a 10yo) :D
