CRAIG: You straight?
DAY-DAY: Yeah, I'm alright. Is my face still orange to you?
CRAIG: Just a little.
DAY-DAY: I can't taste nothing.
CRAIG: What's the matter with your girlfriend?
DAY-DAY: Man, it's a long story. I met D'Wana three months ago. She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention. Come to find out, she six months pregnant. Saying I'm the daddy!
CRAIG: What?
DAY-DAY: Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
CRAIG: Restraining order? Where the hell you meet this girl?
DAY-DAY: I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way. Worst day of my life.
CRAIG: Damn, you got a stalker.
DAY-DAY: That ain't the worst part. Her little sister, Baby D. She's the one that gets real physical. But I got a restraining order on her, too.
CRAIG: You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
DAY-DAY: You don't know Baby D.
