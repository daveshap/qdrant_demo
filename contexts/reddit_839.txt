anyone else get anxiety attacks from memories of bad/cringy/nasty stuff from the past?
I feel like I've become a shit ton better as a person, but there are those nights that make me relive all those bad moments and I beat myself up so much that I get seriously messed up. 

What I wouldn't give to go back and do it all over the right way again..That way, I might've made better friends who would've lasted through maybe?

Or maybe these experiences, they've made me better as a person? They've shaped me? I dont know at this point.

edit - didn't think so many people struggled w this. Awful stuff, but we learn from them and grow as people? take care, all of you, xx
