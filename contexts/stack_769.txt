I want to completely replace Ubuntu with Lubuntu I accidentally issued some commands I thought were safe in the terminal, and I ended up with no System Settings and lots of other missing functionality, but the OS still boots normally. I've decided I want to install Lubuntu instead of fixing Ubuntu for a fresh start and since my laptop is running on a 1GHz dual core AMD CPU.I created a bootable USB as I usually do and placed Lubuntu 17.10 amd64 using Rufus 2.14.1086. I have GRUB that was installed with Ubuntu upon first install I still have Win8.1 which I still want to keep.PS: I also tried creating a startup disk from UbuntuThe question is: How can I boot from USB with GRUB2 so I can overwrite Ubuntu?
