Am I going down the right path?
I just finished my certificate on HubSpot for Social Media Marketing and I'm thinking about doing the HubSpot certificates for Inbound Marketing and Content Marketing, then Google Analytics and AdWords . I wonder if this would be enough to get a internship as a Social Media Coordinator . I also have a Instagram for my photography but since I don't have a camera I'm unsure if this would count. Most jobs I see on Indeed say you need either a Associates or Bachelors degree. And college is something I can probably never afford. So what are the steps I need to take to be a Social Media Coordinator and am I on the right path ?
