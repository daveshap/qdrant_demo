JIM: I got to go in. You better get home too. Hey--what?
PLATO: Why don't you come home with me? I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you? I don't have many--people I can talk to.
JIM: Who has?
PLATO: If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to-- Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
JIM: Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
PLATO: O.K. G'night. I got to pick up my scooter. See you tomorrow.
JIM: Yeah.
