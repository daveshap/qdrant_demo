This will get buried by other posts so whatever.
I drove home and I dont even remember driving, I dont even think I care anymore, I'm just on autopilot, doing what ever it is anybody wants from me. Not that many people even care enough to check in, they just want to take things from me. Sometimes I think if I just dissapeared it would be better, life wouldnt be complicated, and I wouldnt have to live it anymore. It would just be easier. The end.
