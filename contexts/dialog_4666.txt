MARIE: -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week... ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
CLERK: -- Miss Kreutz, please --
MARIE: -- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
