Can I become a academic advisor with a Masters of Arts in Teaching?
I have my bachelors degree in environmental science. Apart from being a scientist, the two other careers Id consider are academic advising and secondary education.

The university in my town offers a MA in teaching but no Masters in Education. I want my teaching credential but also want to have other options in case I ever want to transition out of the classroom.

Academic Advisors, what education background do you have?
