MOTHER SUPERIOR: Sister Mary Patrick?
MARY PATRICK: Yes?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I need to see you, at once. Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments. Mary Clarence?
CHRISTY: Yeah?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return. Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage. Do not attempt discussion. Am I understood?
CHRISTY: I got it.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Come, Sister.
CHRISTY: So, hi there. I'm... Sister Mary Clarence. And you're... young Christians. I guess I should assign you this passage. What's good? What were you talking about?
LAWANDA: We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
CHRISTY: Really.
CHARLENE: Yeah. Sister Mary Pat was discussing it. You know she thinks it's a sin.
CHRISTY: Well... yes. Yes it is.
LAWANDA: How come? Sister?
CHRISTY: Well... because it's in the Bible. Thou shalt not..." Thou shalt not."
CHRISTY: Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here? At Sunday School?
LAWANDA: 'Cause we love it so damn much. And cause we gotta come here. Probation.
CHRISTY: Probation?
CHARLENE: Yeah. We all got caught. Shoplifting. Cuttin' school. Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade. So we gotta come here. So we'll be good, in the future. So we'll learn valuable lessons. And I learned mine. I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again. Can I go now?
CHRISTY: Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
