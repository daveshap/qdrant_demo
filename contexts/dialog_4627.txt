PAMELA: ...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
PAMELA: ...this is Conklin's computer.
PAMELA: ...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
ABBOTT: Do you know what his budget was?
PAMELA: Excuse me.
ABBOTT: We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
PAMELA: May I finish?
ABBOTT: Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln. This is supposed to be definitive?
PAMELA: What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
ABBOTT: So what's your theory? Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name? The man is dead.
