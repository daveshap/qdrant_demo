I got fired for the first time, and I feel terrible
I expect similar stories/experiences about this story, how you felt about it, and how you embraced yourself for the future.

I have not been working for this company for long. I personally got along with my supervisors and I had the skills to do the job. The clients whom I worked with were happy and the target was met. With that being said, the reason I was fired was due to my working method that does not conform to the working method the company enforces. I was fixated on my previous method and tried changing to the method the company enforces. However, the final decision (my getting fired) proved that the change wasn't enough.

I guess that I was uncomfortable with the different method that is enforced by the company. Logically, I know that this is supposed to be just an experience from which I can learn: that companies may have different methods which may not suit you. I know that I have the skills and time, but I just can't shake off this feeling of.... Rejection, I guess? It's like you're focusing on the bad things that have been going on and forgetting about the good things. I guess this partially has to do with the fact that I usually don't fail at the things I don't expect to fail, and it seems like this one just isn't one of them. In the end, I think that it was the best decision for us.

There are some clients whom I was working with. Although I am sure that the company has informed them about this, would it be a good practice to personally inform them about my discontinuation to further work with them? Should I ask for a letter of reference and/or a letter describing why I was fired? Should I send a final thank you email for the employment opportunity?
