I don't want to live.
I'm just tired of life. I don't enjoy life and I have no prospects of enjoying life. I'm not in crisis, I just want to stop being alive because I don't like being alive. I feel about life the way someone might feel about a game of monopoly; I just don't want to play anymore. I'm not sure what that makes me.
