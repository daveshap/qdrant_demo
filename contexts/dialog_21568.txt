NORMAN: I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
ARBOGAST: Anyone at home?
NORMAN: I live there. Alone.
ARBOGAST: Someone is sitting in that window.
NORMAN: My mother.
NORMAN: She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
ARBOGAST: If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
NORMAN: Of course not.
ARBOGAST: If she paid you well?
NORMAN: Now, look...!
ARBOGAST: Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
NORMAN: I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
ARBOGAST: I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
NORMAN: That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me. But... She didn't fool my mother.
ARBOGAST: Your mother met her? Can I talk to your mother?
NORMAN: No. I told you, she's confined...
ARBOGAST: Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
ARBOGAST: Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
NORMAN: No! Just no! I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
ARBOGAST: All right! Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother. But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
