You people have a wonderful weekend!
Don't know if it's ok to post something like this here. If not some mod just delete it but I'd like to say I'm really glad to see so many genuinely caring people in this subreddit. I'm also glad to see people opening up here and getting cheered up or even being helped, even if only a little.

I really like the atmosphere of this subreddit, this is how it should be everywhere. You guys really made my week.

Much love, have the most wonderful weekend! <3
