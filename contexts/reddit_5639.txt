Been Jobless Since September, don't qualify for any type of support. What can I do?
I left my job in September after the environment became completely intolerable. I was having trouble keeping up with the workload after the amount of work I had to do more than doubled, and the person whose work was dumped on my plate started this campaign to make my life miserable. Not actually, but any time I wasn't able to get to something because I didn't have time she would email my supervisor and tell on me. I got asked if I needed her to take back some of the work since I was doing more than my fair share but that just made things worse for me. I wasn't really fighting back in terms of sharing with our supervisor all the things this other person did wrong. It seemed petty at the time. But then I tried applying for unemployment because it's not fair I was essentially bullied into quitting and my supervisor told unemployment I quit over a "personality difference" and  they denied my claim. Because I didn't lose my job over covid I don't qualify for emergency aid either. 

I've tried getting funding to go back to school and gets some new skills training but I can't afford the tuition and I don't qualify for any student aid and because of covid the bank is being stricter with lines of credit so Im not able to receive funding through my bank either despite good credit. 

I am applying for minimum wage jobs now just to get something coming in but even those jobs aren't calling me back. 

Should I dumb down my resume or something? I'm at the end of my rope here.
