CATES: Just tell me about the money.
HAMMOND: Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
CATES: He's after your money.
HAMMOND: You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
HAMMOND: We split 50-50?
CATES: Not likely, convict.
HAMMOND: You gonna let me keep any of it?
CATES: Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
