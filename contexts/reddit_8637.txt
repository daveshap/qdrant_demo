When I visited Italy last year, I felt safer whenever I saw these soldiers. There were 2 guards stationed with fully automatic weapons in every populated area. What are the pros and cons of the United States placing soldiers in schools and other places at risk for domestic terrorist attacks?  Is it legally possible to implement such a program in the United States without running up against the [Posse Comitatus Act?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act)
