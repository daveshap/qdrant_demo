HARDY: Why not?
DUNBAR: I asked for a policeman.
HARDY: You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
DUNBAR: It's... too slow.
HARDY: Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
DUNBAR: I just don't like it.
HARDY: What do you like then?
DUNBAR: I don't know... I like the Army.
HARDY: C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
DUNBAR: You did Basic here?
HARDY: Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
