NORMA: What are you doing, Joe? What are you doing? You're not leaving me?
GILLIS: Yes, I am, Norma.
NORMA: No, you're not. Max! Max!
GILLIS: Max is a good idea. He can help with my luggage. Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe. And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
GILLIS: The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
NORMA: It's yours, Joe. I gave it to you.
GILLIS: And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
NORMA: These are nothing. You can have anything you want if you'll only stay. What is it you want -- money?
GILLIS: Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
NORMA: You can't do this! Max! Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
GILLIS: That's between you and yourself, Norma.
NORMA: You think I made that up about the gun...
NORMA: See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
GILLIS: Oh. sure -- if it would make a good scene.
NORMA: You don't care. do you? But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
GILLIS: Wake up, Norma. You'd be killing yourself to an empty house. The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
NORMA: That's a lie! They still want me!
GILLIS: No, they don't.
NORMA: What about the studio? What about De Mille?
GILLIS: He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
NORMA: Wanted what?
GILLIS: De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you. None of us has had the heart.
NORMA: That's a lie! They want me, they want me! I get letters every day!
GILLIS: You tell her, Max. Come on, do her that favor. Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
NORMA: That isn't true! Max?
