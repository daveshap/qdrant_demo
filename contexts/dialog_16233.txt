BACON: Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
EDDY: I still will, if you don't mind.
TOM: So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
SOAP: That's going on optimism.
TOM: Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
SOAP: You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
