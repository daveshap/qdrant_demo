RAND: Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it? Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
JEFFRIES: No. You're quite wrong. Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people. It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
MRS. RAND: I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner. It'll pass. We've had this sort of thing before.
DR. MAXWELL: This is something else. They're curious. Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
MRS. RAND: I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor.
JEFFRIES: If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here. I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
RAND: To the asylum?
JEFFRIES: I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
RAND: It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
