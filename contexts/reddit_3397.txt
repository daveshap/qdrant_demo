Smart girls are more attractive than dumb girls.
In my personal opinion a smart girl who's a 7 is better than a dumb girl who's a 9. Being intelligent makes a person more attractive. As well as having a good personality. Bland girls who are "hot" aren't interesting and therefore less attractive. Does anyone else agree with this statement?

Edit: I didn't necessarily mean a 7 vs a 9 or whatever I just meant someone who by normal standards would be considered "less attractive". Also i would be willing to stake my life on the idea that most women are easily 7s. And most women if they have a good personality break the fucking scale. There's no way to actually rate people because everyone sees people differently. The 1-10 scale is for me at least just a blanket basis. Most guys and I'm sure women rate people on this scale before they've met them. After you've met someone the scale no longer exists because it's no longer just a blanket opinion. It can be expanded upon. (I probably just dug myself a deeper hole but too late now)
