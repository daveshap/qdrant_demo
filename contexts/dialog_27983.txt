THELMA: So what are you gonna tell him?
LOUISE: Nothing. I'm not gonna tell him a thing. The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
THELMA: You are so sweet to that guy, you really are. Imagine not wanting to drag him into this. He is a lucky man.
LOUISE: I didn't ask him to come! It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
THELMA: Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
LOUISE: Put a lid on it, Thelma! It's hard enough as it is. Just let me get this part over with. Now stay here and guard the money. If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
THELMA: I won't wait up.
LOUISE: How do I look?
THELMA: You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
LOUISE: Have another drink, Thelma.
