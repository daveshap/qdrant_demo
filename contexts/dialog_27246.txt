MULDER: Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
SCULLY: All I told them was the truth.
MULDER: They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
SCULLY: They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
MULDER: What? What are you talking about?
SCULLY: I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
MULDER: Why?
SCULLY: I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
MULDER: They were the ones that put us together.
SCULLY: Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
MULDER: This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
SCULLY: They're not doing this, Mulder. I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
MULDER: You're... quitting?
SCULLY: There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore. Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
