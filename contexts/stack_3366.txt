Why did Charles keep Shaw immobile? Charles clearly understands that Erik is preparing to kill Shaw with the coin, and is emphatically trying to telepathically talk him out if it. When Charles realizes he is about to fail at this, why does he continue to hold Shaw immobile?In doing so, Charles is literally holding Shaw helpless to Erik's attack. Why didn't he just release Shaw and allow his life to be spared, which he was so desperate to do just a moment earlier? At least Shaw would then have had a fighting chance to defend himself.
