If you have an expensive prescription, contact the drug's manufacturer and tell them you need help.
Bristol Myers Squib just gave me a card that changed the cost of my prescription from $500 a month to $10 a month for 2 years... and they will renew it after that!  Sorry if this is a repost but this was a literal life saver for me.
