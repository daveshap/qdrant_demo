The US Constitution Article 2 Section 3 appears to give the president the ability to adjourn congress. Has this ever been used?
In light of Brexit discussions on [proroguing](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48936711) where [parliament has been suspended seemingly to prevent interference in the Brexit proceeding,](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49604584)

Article 2 describes the powers of the executive, under section 3 it appears a number of responsibilities are listed including 

> [...he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper...](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-3--2)

Is congress today ever at risk of disagreeing on what time they adjourn, and if so, has a president ever exercised their right to forcibly adjourn congress in the case of such disagreement?

Further, what prevents a party in power of at least one house and the presidency from conspiring to disagree on adjournment and let the president adjourn congress at some opportune time? Have other laws superseded and/or made this executive power irrelevant?
