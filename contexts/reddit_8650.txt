How do hoax hate crimes influence race relations, political climate, and the ability for the average citizen to find the truth?
[This](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/12/23/sorry-haters-a-handful-of-hoaxes-doesn-t-debunk-the-hate-crime-reality.html) article from The Daily Beast, and [this](http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/12/21/a-lot-of-these-socalled-postelection-hate-crimes-are-turning-out-to-be-hoaxes-huh-n2262429) from Town Hall sum up the issue I am referring to. There have been a few widely reported hate crimes over the past few months, some of which are true, while others have been debunked. 

Below are a few examples, which prompted this topic.


1) [The NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/us/black-church-burned-in-mississippi-with-vote-trump-scrawled-on-side.html?_r=0) reported on a black church being burned and "vote trump" written on it. It's later [confirmed](http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2016/12/22/man-charged-church-burning-requests-defender/95773264/) that the arsonist was an African-American member of the church.

2) [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tamerragriffin/drunk-men-yelling-donald-trump-attempt-to-remove-womans-hija) original article and addendum where the woman was arrested for filing a fake police report.

3) Youtuber's claimed they were thrown off a Delta flight for speaking Arabic, the current evidence points toward a publicity stunt [NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/world/delta-air-lines-adam-saleh.html), [LATimes](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-delta-adam-saleh-youtube-provocative-20161222-story.html)

Some points of discussion:


A) What impact does this have on our political climate? An [interesting vice article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/why-do-people-fake-hate-crimes) interviews two researchers who speculate that people are capitalizing on the current political climate and confirmation bias. They posit that most people will read these headlines, make a quick conclusion based on their ideology, and move on. Which leads me to my second point -

B) How does the average person sift through these incidents to uncover the truth?  There is no denying there is an increase in hate crimes in the USA [source](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/21/anti-muslim-assaults-reach-911-era-levels-fbi-data-show/), at least towards certain demographics (Muslims), but the rise of hoax hate crimes is at least, an interesting phenomena. My goal is to determine the facts, and this is becoming an increasingly effortful process.
