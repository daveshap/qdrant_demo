Online school sucks for me
Have done about a days worth of work for 2 of my classes over the span of 6 weeks. All the rest of my classes I have completely ignored. I want to do well in school and jobs that I’m interested in require university degrees so you’d think I would try a little harder but although I WANT to try harder I can’t because ??? If the want to do well is there where is the motivation? I worry I might fail school and get a job I hate but I still don’t do school work. It’s similar when I’m physically at school but I do lots more work when I’m actually there and I actually listen and do work. I seriously hope we go back to school this week (it’s possible for my country) but in reality I should stop being lazy because I have nothing to do, all the time in the world to do school yet somehow procrastinate and have no motivation to do it
