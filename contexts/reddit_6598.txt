Can Jobs really have “mandatory” overtime?
I work at a call center and they’re demanding mandatory overtime because of a hurricane. Now I’m suppose to work 5 extra hours somewhere in all my PTO. (I have paid time off for the reminder of the month starting next Tuesday).

It pisses me off. So I have to basically work 10 or 12 hours on shifts because of all the time off. Is this legal?
