Listing all point items in polygon? I'm trying to get a list of all points (from a point layer) that can be found in a unique rectangle polygon.Input layer 1: points (address data)<br>Input layer 2: rectangle polygon layer (created with research tools, create grid)I used the grid to create an atlas and now my goal is, to get different lists, that show me what page contains what addresses. As output I need a list with all addresses and an \"extra column\" that shows me on what atlas page I can find each address. So that I can take the right page when someone gives me an address to find.If there is a function to analyse that, I'm unable to find it.
