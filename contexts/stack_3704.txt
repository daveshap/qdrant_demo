Structural Equation Modeling with ordinal dependent variable and categorical independent variable I'd like to do a structural equation modeling for an ordinal dependent variable.  Moreover, I have ordinal and categorical independent variables in the model.  The ordinal dependent variable is the frequency of visiting parks.  The ordinal independent variables are demographic variables, including age, education level. The categorical independent variables are some demographic variables.  Such as gender(female, male), marriage(single, married, widowed), occupation(student, employee, retire, and unemployed).I've learned that Mplus could deal with categorical dependent variables?  But how about the categorical independent variables?What software and method could address such issue?  Thanks!
