NINOTCHKA: I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
LEON: It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
NINOTCHKA: It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
LEON: From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
