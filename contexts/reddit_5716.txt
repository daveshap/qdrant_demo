Live in work/// travel work in the US
Hey so this is gonna take a little context. Im a 21y/o american who set out on an adventure from my hometown about 7 months ago. I rode across the US on a motorcycle, made it to L.A worked as a editor for a bit and then bought a plane ticket to Vietnam. Travel and stupidity in Vietnam meant that I ran through the rest of my cash, and with the virus they shut down all the schools meaning the only work opportunity out here (english teaching) is obsolete. Im coming back into L.A sometime soon to pick up my bike. But I'm gonna be dead broke and essentially homeless, I've heard about people working on farms and grapevines up in north cal but I cant seem to find anything about that. Ive put some testers out on workaway. Im coming in with only 200 in my pocket, and that makes me n.e.r.v.o.u.s. Anyone know anything about live in summer jobs? Something that will board me up for a little bit? Im thinking the national forest service, the peace corps, americorps, or even the USMC. But I dont know much about any of those application processes and I can't seem to find much literature. 

Sincerely, No idea what the hell it is im doing all I know is I gotta start bringing in revenue.
