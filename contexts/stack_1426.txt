I2S TDM channels maximum bandwidth Does I2S support sending multiple mic (around 20) channel data? If no, what is the limiting factor in supporting multiple mics?Also, is there any way to send multiple channel data from different MICs in any other format other than TDM, if TDM on I2S doesn't allow more than certain number of channels?It is a generic question and any hardware can be sited as an example. All I am after is that given any hardware what limits the maximum mic supported?Mic stands for microphone.
