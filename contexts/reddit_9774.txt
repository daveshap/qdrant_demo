Fear of getting stuck...
 For background, I graduated with a BA in management from a small private college in MN in 2018. After graduation, I was hired as a Housing Director at a very small college. After this year, I will have two years of experience under my belt in residential life. Additionally— this year, I have an additional position in academic retention. I have been accepted to my top choice grad program for the fall of 2020. I know that I am qualified for a graduate assistantship in residential life, which would come with free housing. Because I know I will have very limited income as a grad student, free housing is a huge draw. BUT, if I have learned anything in my time as a Housing Director, it is that housing/res life is NOT my passion. I would love to never have to work in res life again. SO— my question is, with the two years of experience in res life, and an assistantship in the same area, would I be condemning myself to a career working in res life? How hard would it be for me to get out of res life if I were interested in moving into campus activities type work?

Thanks so much in advance!
