Reminder of a few important unnoticed characteristics of anxiety you might have missed
- It urges you to find a solution ASAP, there is an element of hurry and unnecessary haste.

- It urges you to find the perfect solution right away and rejects everything but the perfect solution

- It plays with your memory and conveniently distorts successful events into memories of failure because of catastrophising

- Because anxiety is often accompanied by depression, memory is foggy and because your animal mind realises that your memory is unreliable it adds more and more fear-based shortcuts to prevent you from forgetting the right response to several common daily situations. This obviously makes your life entirely poisoned and anxiety driven.

The software engineering equivalent would be using only exception handling and error handling to handle conditional statements like 'if' and 'switch/case'.

You can come to rely on an elaborate system of pain-trigger-responses (exception handlers) rather than normal behaviour (if/switch) and live in misery and still be highly functioning. This is typically with people who have anxiety for many years or decades.

So if you have a temporary or recurring memory dysfunction (depression, neurological injury, nerve damage, brain injury, migraines, constant headaches), normal visualisation may become difficult and in order to function and not go blank and forget things all the time, you might start using your limbic system to make memory shortcuts instead of your brain. This causes constant anxiety.

- You could use the name  "fight/flight/freeze response" or "exaggerated limbic system response" instead of the name "anxiety"

The name "Anxiety" makes it sound like it is a mysterious human disorder, whereas it is clearly about the "stupid" animal mind inside us, and it pushes the blame correctly on the limbic system, taking away the mystery and "unknown" aspect of it, **thus making it much more benign and robbing it of its primary weapon - fearsomeness**
