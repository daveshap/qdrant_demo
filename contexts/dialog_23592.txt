LESTER: I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
GEORGE: Oh yeah?
LESTER: -- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
GEORGE: I know what you mean.
LESTER: Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
JACKIE: Fine.
JACKIE: Jesus...
GEORGE: -- Yeah... your car down here?
GEORGE: -- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
JACKIE: -- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
GEORGE: I don't know. Probably not.
JACKIE: Jill's really great, isn't she?
GEORGE: Great... so how's everything with you?
