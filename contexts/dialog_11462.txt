MEIERHEIM: What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind? ...Or is that the time?
GRUSINSKAYA: I'm cancelling the engagement.
MEIERHEIM: Oh!
MEIERHEIM: Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
GRUSINSKAYA: The house is not full -- Is it really full?
MEIERHEIM: Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
GRUSINSKAYA: Oh -- but it can't be.
SUZETTE: Oh, come, Madam -- please come.
GRUSINSKAYA: All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
PIMENOV: We will wait.
MEIERHEIM: You are late. Hurry.
