HARRY: Our answer.
NORMAN: To what?
HARRY: Time travel. A black hole.
HARRY: Ted? Captain?
BARNES: Yes, Harry.
HARRY: We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
BARNES: So do we. And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
NORMAN: Picked up something? What is it?
BARNES: I don't know. But it's something alien.
HARRY: This answers one of our questions.
NORMAN: Which one? Let me get the list out.
HARRY: This spacecraft was designed to pick things up. They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in. They come across this. This... <u>sphere</u>. Find it interesting, curious. They draw it inside to take back home.
NORMAN: But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
HARRY: Our present.
BARNES: But what does it do? This... sphere.
TED: Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know? See this red here.
TED: Looks like a design, some writing, maybe. Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
HARRY: Look closely. That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
HARRY: No. They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all. They have another purpose entirely.
BARNES: What?
HARRY: To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
BARNES: A break for what?
