LifeProTip: Cashing out change at CoinStar to buy necessities at the store? Use self checkout instead and the machine will sort and count your coins for you and not charge a fee.
I’ve had to do this before and I actually did it again today. I had about $40 in coins and needed food and gas. I went early while it wasn’t busy, bought a $10 Kroger gift card and my food then used the self checkout. I could then use my gift card at the gas pump for fuel and in the end save myself about $2-3 necessary dollars going to waste with coin star.
