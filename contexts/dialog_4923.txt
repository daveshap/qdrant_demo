JANE: I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
TOM: He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
JANE: No. Did he really?
TOM: Yes. Then he said a really weird thing...
JANE: What?
TOM: That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
JANE: That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint... Whooo.
BLAIR: They canned me. Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
JANE: It's started.
