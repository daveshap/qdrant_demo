ROBIN: I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
PETER: Sooner than the Fall.
ROBIN: After the kids are back in school.
PETER: Lois will stay with them. Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
ROBIN: I'm helping George build his house.
PETER: What?
ROBIN: I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks. Sam's working. I told you Sam was working. I mean, he really is.
PETER: Good. That was the plan. We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
ROBIN: I can't go right now.
PETER: You can't go because of Sam?
ROBIN: We haven't been away together for three years. What difference does a few months make?
PETER: You can't go with me because of Sam?
ROBIN: Sam is working at something for the first time in his life. Once in a while he even talks to me. I want to be around for that.
PETER: So am I, Robin. I'm working at something, too. I'm even talking. Do you want to be around for it?
