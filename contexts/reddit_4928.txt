Needing help with my inferiority complex
I'm a 19 year old brazillian guy who had a Very lonely life as a kid and as a teenager due to my Mother being overly protective,so now i'm basically a person with many socializing problems and a constant fear of being judged by others.I just want to know If anyone here has passed through the same and how did you grow out of it.
