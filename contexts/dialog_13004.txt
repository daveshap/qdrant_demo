PRESIDENT: Paul. Are you alright?
PAUL: We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
PRESIDENT: Out? Where are you going?
PAUL: I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
PRESIDENT: All. What do you mean all?
PAUL: The staff, the guests.
PRESIDENT: The staff and guests! How many?
PAUL: Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
