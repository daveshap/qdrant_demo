Should I disclose pregnancy to new employer before drug test?
I started a new job recently but because of Covid-19, they do not want me to get the drug test or physical done before they open which most likely won't happen until mid June. They even sent me a revised job offer stating that if I didn't pass the tests then they could fire me. I'm very confident I'll pass both but I'm 5 months pregnant and didn't plan to tell my employer until I passed everything. I'm afraid if I tell them before I take the tests that they'll come up with some reason why they can't keep me and fire me either before or after I take my drug test/physical. Should I tell them now so they can prepare for my impending absence or just wait until everything comes back clean and I'm in for good? Thanks!
