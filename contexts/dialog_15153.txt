INSPECTOR: Kafka -- is that your real name?
KAFKA: Yes. Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
INSPECTOR: When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
KAFKA: Wednesday. We left the office together.
INSPECTOR: Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
KAFKA: No, we said goodbye outside the building. He went off, as usual, toward his house.
INSPECTOR: Your office is the Workmen's --
KAFKA: -- Accident and Compensation Association.
INSPECTOR: Where you've been employed for seven years.
KAFKA: Eight -- and seven months.
INSPECTOR: Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
KAFKA: Well -- other departments are, yes.
INSPECTOR: Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
KAFKA: Yes. Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends. How was Eduard ...
INSPECTOR: He was found in the River. Could he swim?
KAFKA: I don't know.
INSPECTOR: Was he depressed?
KAFKA: No. He didn't seem to be. Do you think he drowned himself?
INSPECTOR: Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
KAFKA: No, I suppose not.
INSPECTOR: He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
KAFKA: Can I ask -- how you found me?
INSPECTOR: His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
KAFKA: I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
INSPECTOR: We know that.
KAFKA: He wasn't a lonely man, though.
INSPECTOR: What makes you think so?
KAFKA: ... Just a perception.
