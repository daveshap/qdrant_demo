Next month I'll know if my Papillary Thyroid Cancer has spread or not, and the only thing I can think about, in case the results are bad: I don't want to leave my wife behind.
I know what I'm suffering from is common and highly curable, but I can't shake the feeling that it might have spread, just because it's a possibility. If it has, 90% chance it's fatal. It's the worst case scenario, I know, but my mind works this way.

 I'll know next month for sure.

My wife and I have been married for less than a month. She's the kindest person I know. A colleague asked me yesterday "what's next?", like, if I'm fine then we'll buy a house, have babies... That's "easy".

But if I'm not... it didn't occur to me before but the worst thing I can think of is that I'd leave her behind... she doesn't deserve this.

We truly love each other, it's a perfect match, we've been together for 4.5 years and we never had a fight, ever.

Disagreements, sure, but we never yelled at each other, we are never mad at each other.

We are still young, 32 & 33, she'll recover eventually if something happens, hopefully, but we've planned on getting old together, with kids, dogs, a house. I don't wank to shatter her dreams in any way.

Sorry, I just needed to vent, thanks for listening.
