how would've you reacted "You can start by apologizing for being depressed"
Hey guys, this is a quote that a super dear friend of mine said when she was upset and angry at the world. I couldnt handle this quote, and I had to shut the conversation after a fuck you for that. the context is that I was naming a couple of coaping skills (cause god knows that's something I've learned a lot of in the last couple of years) and he/she said stop, I proceed ed to say, in just trying to help, sorry, (which I didnt intend at all to sound like I was mocking him or her), this was followed with this message
sorry if u dont understand but I'm still agitated and he/she wont talk to me.
I just wanted to know how any of you guys that has depression and anxiety would've reacted and how do you interoperate this quote. pls help
