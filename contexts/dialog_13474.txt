JANEY: Jesus, Jim!
JIM: Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
JANEY: Just be careful.
JIM: You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
JANEY: Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
JIM: Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
PHILIP: In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
ELENA: You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
PHILIP: -- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
ELENA: All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
PHILIP: You ask what the point is?
ELENA: That's right.
PHILIP: Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
ELENA: I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
PHILIP: If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean... My, I sound a bit --
ELENA: I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
PHILIP: You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
ELENA: But not too ashamed.
PHILIP: Now you are being rude.
ELENA: And you're still trying to get me into bed.
PHILIP: Ouch.
DOROTHY: Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
ELENA: I suppose we'll make an appearance.
DOROTHY: And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
