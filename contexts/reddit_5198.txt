Give me and others a bit of hope.
22. Recent graduate - 


I’ve been applying for jobs consistently mostly entry level ones but with no luck. I did get invited to attend a few interviews though. However; I’m still here...jobless. 

I’m in desperate need of hope. I feel like giving up. 

How long did it take you to land a job? And for those of you who are currently in my situation, how long have you been unemployed for? 

Edit: Thank you all so much for leaving a comment and sharing your experience/advice. I appreciate it!

It's comforting to know that you are not alone in any of your struggles, this one in particular. I hope I can come back with an update soon. The purpose of this post was to help myself and others to not lose hope and feel alone. 
I wish you all the absolute best. :)

UPDATE: If anyone happens to come across this post, don’t give up. I finally got a job after almost 7 months! && it’s also related to my degree!
Remember everything really does happen for a reason. With every rejection you face, you are one step CLOSER to getting accepted. Hang in there :)
