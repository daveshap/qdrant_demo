JIMMY THE DEMON: You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
NICKY: I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
DAD: That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
NICKY: Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
DAD: Please, Nicky, get back up there. Try to hurry.
