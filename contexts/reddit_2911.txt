What does it actually take to move to and work in Ireland?
With all the crap going on in our country I would love to know my options. Has anyone been successful in relocating to another country for work in the semi recent past? For reference I do marketing, so not some super high demand job like engineering or anything. I've been doing agency work for over 5 years now and specialize in digital marketing (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn ads, etc)
