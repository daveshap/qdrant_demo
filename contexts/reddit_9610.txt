Anyone want to trade mock interviews?
Hi all! I have an interview for an academic advising position coming up and I'd love to do a practice interview beforehand. Would anyone in the same boat (or anyone just wanting to practice interview skills) want to trade mock interviews? I figure we could do it by Skype or Google Hangouts. Let me know if you're interested.
