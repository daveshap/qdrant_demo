Did Nancy Pelosi violate federal law in tearing up the President's SOTU Address documents?
There is a [federal statute regarding document destruction] (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2071), and the penalty for for unlawful or accidental destruction is fine or imprisonment.

[Congressman Matt Gaetz] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz) has alleged that [Nancy Pelosi violated federal laws in tearing up the president's SOTU address](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/standing-behind-trump-nancy-pelosi-rips-copy-his-state-union-n1130331) and has [filed an ethics complaint against Pelosi for her actions] (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/matt-gaetz-nancy-pelosi-ethics-complaint-state-of-the-union-rip-speech/)

Some have said the [copies of the speech that are handed to the VP and Speaker are the "official" record of the speech](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2020/02/06/gaetz-files-ethics-complaint-against-pelosi-n2560865) for each respective body (one for the senate and one for the house). Other have said these are just [copies, and only one exists for the official federal record] (https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/208/did-nancy-pelosi-commit-a-crime-by-ripping-up-the-state-of-the-union-speech/277-29fb69fa-f8b1-4dd8-aab4-f49434a6dbc3).

So which is it? Was it illegal, and if so, should Pelosi face consequences, or was it just a copy that warrants no further legal action?
