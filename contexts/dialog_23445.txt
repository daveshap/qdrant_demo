CYNTHIA: Oh, okay. I think I get it.
GRAHAM: What do you get?
CYNTHIA: Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
GRAHAM: Not exactly.
CYNTHIA: Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
GRAHAM: Why don't you let me tape you?
CYNTHIA: Doing what?
GRAHAM: Talking.
CYNTHIA: About what?
GRAHAM: Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
CYNTHIA: What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
GRAHAM: Nothing.
CYNTHIA: You just want to ask me questions?
GRAHAM: I just want to ask you questions.
CYNTHIA: And that's all?
GRAHAM: That's all.
CYNTHIA: Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
GRAHAM: Yes.
CYNTHIA: Would anybody else see the tape?
GRAHAM: Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
CYNTHIA: How do we start?
GRAHAM: I turn on the camera. You start talking.
CYNTHIA: And you ask questions, right?
GRAHAM: Yes.
CYNTHIA: How long will it take?
GRAHAM: That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
CYNTHIA: Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
GRAHAM: No.
CYNTHIA: Do I sit or stand?
GRAHAM: Whichever you prefer.
CYNTHIA: I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
GRAHAM: Just a moment.
GRAHAM: I am now recording. Tell me your name.
CYNTHIA: Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
GRAHAM: Describe for me your first sexual experience.
CYNTHIA: My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
GRAHAM: Your first sexual experience.
CYNTHIA: I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated
GRAHAM: Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
CYNTHIA: No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
GRAHAM: How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
CYNTHIA: When I was fourteen.
GRAHAM: Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
CYNTHIA: Very much live.
GRAHAM: What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
CYNTHIA: Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
GRAHAM: Were you disappointed?
CYNTHIA: No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
GRAHAM: What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
CYNTHIA: It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
GRAHAM: What did he say?
CYNTHIA: He said that my hand felt good.
GRAHAM: Then what happened?
CYNTHIA: Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
JOHN: John Millaney.
CYNTHIA: I want to see you.
JOHN: When?
CYNTHIA: Right now.
JOHN: Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
CYNTHIA: Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
