Extract By Mask - Raster Horizontal Shift Is there a way to snap a raster/DEM to a mosaic dataset?I am using the Extract By Mask tool in ArcPro on a mosaic dataset. The output raster's cell values do not match the original mosaic dataset it came from. The cells seem to have shifted after the Extract By Mask Tool was run. The only way I know how to fix this problem is by changing \"Snap Raster\" in Environments, but have not yet found a way to snap a raster to a mosaic dataset.
