Anybody else wishing that they could run away instead of killing themselves?
I wish I had some money saved away and a car, I wish I could drive away and never come back to my life. 

I always wish for a simple life, I always dream i’m driving to Uruguay and that i’m changing my name to Hermano or whatever the fuck, I’d teach kids to swim and spend my days getting stoned by myself. I’d volunteer at a soup kitchen and write my books at night.

But that never happens, i’m completely by myself and in a relationship where i’m most likely being used. Nobody gives a fuck about me. I just want to be better.
