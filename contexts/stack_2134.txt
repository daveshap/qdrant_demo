If you leave a dungeon to save, does it reset its state? I'm working on the Pitioss Ruins dungeon, but I'd rather not do it all in one day. Plus I'm getting paranoid that my PS4 will mysteriously shut off or something and I'll have to start over! Obviously, I can't save in the dungeon, but I think I can get back to the entrance without too much trouble. The question is, if I leave, save, then reload, will my progress in the dungeon be kept or reset?
