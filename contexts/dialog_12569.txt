HIDER: You test each one thoroughly?
BERT: You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests. You want consistency? You want dependability? You want safety?
HIDER: Safety?
BERT: Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>. I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle... ... then look out.
BERT: Look at that. You can't buy better protection than that. That there is your Man's Best Friend.
HIDER: How are they with kids?
BERT: They're great with kids. They love 'em. They eat 'em up. I'm kidding.
HIDER: So this really does the trick, eh?
BERT: Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle. And God help whoever it is. Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground. Put your faith in that, pal.
