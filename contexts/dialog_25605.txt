WOMAN: I told you...
MAN: Judy, that's stupid.
WOMAN: Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
MAN: You know that's impossible!
WOMAN: I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
MAN: Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
