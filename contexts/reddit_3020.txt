Would you quit a job after 2 years of zero raises, bonuses, benefits and overtime?
Is it wrong to feel like I’m being abused? This is not a small company that makes no money. They’re a F500 company leader in their sector and they give me the minimum compensation. They just keep giving me more work.  I’ve always shown dedication but it’s starting to feel like it’s a waste time.
