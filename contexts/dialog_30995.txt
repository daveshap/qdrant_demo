UNCLE BILLY: I told you you could do it.
TED: I was like a different person tonight.
UNCLE BILLY: You were the new and improved you.
TED: I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
UNCLE BILLY: No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
TED: It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
UNCLE BILLY: You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
TED: Really? You'd do that for me?
UNCLE BILLY: I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
TED: You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
UNCLE BILLY: I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
TED: My parents always say hard work builds character.
UNCLE BILLY: It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
TED: What kind of ideas?
UNCLE BILLY: Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of classic beauty.""
TED: You think we should be more open minded?
UNCLE BILLY: The world is a big, beautiful place. We can open new markets in Africa and Asia. Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
TED: In other words, our scope is too narrow.
UNCLE BILLY: At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
TED: That's perfect.
