LT. AMOS: What are you running from?
FORD: Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
LT. AMOS: If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
FORD: Why do you hate me? It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
LT. AMOS: Two words. Disco Express.
FORD: Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
LT. AMOS: 'Booty Time.'
FORD: Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
LT. AMOS: Like me.
FORD: I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
LT. AMOS: 'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A. It's booty time...'
FORD: You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks. Really.
THE KID: Ouch.
FORD: Hey, you, get off my cloud. I'm talking to my friend. 1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
THE KID: Who cares? I got a case.
FORD: Twelve pack?
THE KID: This ain't no social call. One hundred bucks. To find my father.
FORD: Did he just say what I think he said?
THE KID: I've got a clue. Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
FORD: Holy Colonel Mustard. Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
THE KID: You need it.
FORD: I don't need it that bad.
