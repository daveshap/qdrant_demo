JOSIE: Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
ROB: No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your things that make you a better person than me" list."
JOSIE: Better person than I.
ROB: See!
JOSIE: I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
ROB: I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
JOSIE: This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
ROB: Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
JOSIE: How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
ROB: Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
JOSIE: For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
