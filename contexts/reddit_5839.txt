What should I major in?
I'm young, and starting college soon. My dad is an executive for Samsung, and I want to have a job like him one day. Of course, I don't thrive for as high as he has achieved, but I want to work in technology. Though I'm confused, I know enough that a job at Sony, Microsoft, google, or one of those kinds of companies is what I can imagine. I envision myself dealing with the creative sides of things, stuff like designing interfaces, but also don't mind math and such. What should I aim to major in? Just looking for second opinions.
