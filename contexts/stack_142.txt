File Sharing User Limit? Does non-Server macOS still have a file sharing user limit these days? The way they are abandoning the idea of running Mac Servers, it seems plausible they could have removed the file sharing limit from \"client\" macOS.Also was the former (and maybe current) 10-user limit, a limit of the number of different file sharing users that could connect at once, OR a limit of the number of inbound filesharing connections?In other words, if you created two file sharing users, could 15 people connect if 7 used account A and 8 used account B?
