PINZON: You lied! You cheated! We're way past 750 leagues!
COLUMBUS: Six days ago, yes.
PINZON: You must be mad...!
COLUMBUS: We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
PINZON: We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
COLUMBUS: You think I don't know that?
PINZON: We're lost!
COLUMBUS: The land is there. I know it!
PINZON: You don't know anything! Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
COLUMBUS: And then what? Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
PINZON: Jesus Maria! I should have never listened to you!
COLUMBUS: You never did. You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
PINZON: You bloody...
COLUMBUS: Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward! Think about that!
PINZON: You tell that to them!
COLUMBUS: You're right. Let the men decide.
