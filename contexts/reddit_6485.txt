HR says I can't return because I didn't submit my timesheets
 I've done two contracts for this company with the most recent one ending in November. While there I had a bad habit of not submitting one of the two time sheets that we were required to submit each week. One was for the company I worked for and the other for the client. Needless to say my supervisor wants me back and the recruiter I've been speaking to says I have a clean work record with their client company so the problem is just the on-site HR person that is saying no due to the timesheet. I guess maybe she thinks I stole money?
