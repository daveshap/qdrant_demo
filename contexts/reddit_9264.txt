Would it be worth it to go to college at 33 years old?
I think I'm pretty much topped out at making $35k a year without a degree. Which is...adequate, I guess? I feel like wasting my years working unskilled jobs that pay "good enough" isnt actually good enough, and since I'm finally at a point where I have a decent amount of money saved I could probably pay for college as I go instead of taking out a bunch of loans. So part of me thinks it could be a good idea, part of me thinks I'm too old.
