MELANIE: The town looks clear.
MITCH: The bay doesn't.
MELANIE: How long have they been gathering there?
MITCH: The past fifteen minutes. It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
MELANIE: I keep thinking of Annie.
MITCH: It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
MELANIE: Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
MITCH: It may not be last week again for a long long time.
