Why are so many people against choosing a career(lucrative degree) mostly for the pay?
Like I get the whole "do something you love" deal but honestly, the ONLY jobs on this planet that I would even remotely think of as a "dream job" either pay jack or just aren't at all realistic. I'm 21 years old, I had stopped going to school when I was 19 and worked full time retail(Home Depot) for a year and a half to decide what I want with my life before making any rash decisions in my degree choice. I quit recently and decided to get my ass back to school ASAP because nothing pushes/motivates you towards higher education than a POS job amirite lol. Decided to change my major from art(which I honestly have a big passion for) to something that's actually gonna help me retire as young as possible so I can still hopefully pursue art young but instead with my bank account being obese this time around. Now it's really just a game of which high paying career route to go with. But upon telling this to my friends they hit me with the "WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!" or "IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PASSION FOR THE JOB DON'T GO FOR IT" and also "I'D RATHER WORK A JOB I LOVE AND GET PAYED JACK THAN DO SOMETHING I HATE THAT PAYS WELL". But unlike them, i'm not a fan of paying an arm and leg to go to college just to come out with a 30K-40K a year salary. But apparently a lot of people feel the way they do. So just wanna know if it's REALLY that big of a deal to pick a lucrative career for the money. (of course not something that'll obviously kill you like underwater welding)
