What are some high-earning jobs that can be done remotely?
I hate my job and the field I've found myself in as a whole. I loathe cities. I want to travel full time. I'm looking for input/suggestions on any careers or jobs you know of that can be performed remotely and have starting salaries/realistic earning potential over $100k.  Any field/type of job welcome, as I'm completely open to suggestions.  Just trying to get an idea of what's possible.
