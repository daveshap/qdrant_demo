Handicapped by work history.
I work retail. It's an awful setting that doesn't actually give you anything in return. Unfortunately, that also means my resume seems to only be good for landing Sales and Retail work.

I have the aptitudes and desire for a technical job, like electrician, but my lack of applicable work experience or contacts keeps getting me passed over for consideration, and I can neither afford the time nor the money to go to school.

Not helped by the fact that apparently you need journeyman levels of experience to get hired as an apprentice nowadays.

Short of killing myself, what do I do?
