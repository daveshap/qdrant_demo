ALEX: Two down. Two to go.
WALSH: Down?" Wait
ALEX: The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed.
ALEX: You think I'm crazy.
WALSH: I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
ALEX: Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out.
WALSH: What do they do that they had to kill her?
ALEX: I was hoping you'd find out.
WALSH: Yeah. I sure will.
