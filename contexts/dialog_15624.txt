MAURICE: What steps do we take now?
DR. RAY: We operate. We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
MAURICE: What are the odds? Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
DR. RAY: It's hard to say. It's a delicate surgery. There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
MAURICE: Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
ADELLE: What?
MAURICE: I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
ADELLE: Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice. Done. Finished. You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
MAURICE: I'm completing the walk. I'm almost there.
