DR. TAYLOR: How are you feeling today?
ALEX: Fine. Fine.
DR. TAYLOR: Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
ALEX: I haven't seen you before.
DR. TAYLOR: I'm your Psychiatrist.
ALEX: Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
DR. TAYLOR: Just part of hospital routine.
ALEX: What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
DR. TAYLOR: No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
ALEX: Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
DR. TAYLOR: Yes?
ALEX: Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
DR. TAYLOR: Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
ALEX: Oh.
DR. TAYLOR: Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
ALEX: Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
DR. TAYLOR: Isn't the plumage beautiful?
ALEX: I just say what the other person would say?
DR. TAYLOR: Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
ALEX: Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
DR. TAYLOR: Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
ALEX: That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
DR. TAYLOR: Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
ALEX: Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
DR. TAYLOR: Good. What do you want?
ALEX: Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
DR. TAYLOR: Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
ALEX: Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
ALEX: Fucking hell...
DR. TAYLOR: Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
ALEX: I hope so. Is that the end then?
DR. TAYLOR: Yes.
ALEX: I was quite enjoying that.
DR. TAYLOR: Good. I'm glad
ALEX: How many did I get right?
DR. TAYLOR: It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
ALEX: And when do I get out of here then?
DR. TAYLOR: I'm sure it won't be long now.
