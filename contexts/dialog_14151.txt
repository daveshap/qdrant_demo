ELLIE: Any luck?
PETER: Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
ELLIE: What about money?
PETER: Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
ELLIE: That's swell!
PETER: I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
ELLIE: I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
PETER: Okay. Cottage Number Three.
WIFE: There you go—trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you—
OWNER: He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
WIFE: Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
OWNER: Said he was gonna stay a week.
WIFE: Mebbe.
OWNER: Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
WIFE: I don't trust him.
