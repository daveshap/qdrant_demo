I got a bachelor’s degree just so I can get paid $11 an hour?
I just need to tell someone how I’m feeling. I left my shitty job where I was getting paid $600/biweekly about two weeks ago and have been job searching since then. I keep seeing jobs with requirements of a bachelor degree and only jobs that pay $10-$11 an hour. I have yet to find one that pays more than that. I feel so upset. So mad at myself for going to college and getting in debt. For what? For nothing? I should’ve majored in engineering or something useful. Not sociology or Spanish. And no, I don’t want to be a teacher. I don’t like kids and just left my job of two years where I was a classroom assistant. 

I mean, should I learn to code? What can I do? I have some social anxiety so I’m kind of scared to talk to people and would love to sit behind a computer working. I just need some advice. I feel so upset.
