BASQUIAT: What's with the wigs?
ANDY WARHOL: I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
BASQUIAT: You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
BASQUIAT: Piss painting?
ANDY WARHOL: I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
BASQUIAT: How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
ANDY WARHOL: I don't like beer.
