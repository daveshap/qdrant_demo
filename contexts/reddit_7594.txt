Switching specialities/disciplines for a Postdoc?
Has anyone here succesfully switched specialities or disciplines (to some degree) for postdoc and other career positions?

I am currently finishing my PhD and I am kind of dreading the idea of staying in this subdiscipline because I find many of the researchers toxic and would much prefer at this point to switch over to an applied/industry position in the future but maybe that won't be possible. Sigh. 

Any experience and advice would be appreciated
