Transactional Replication Reinitialize I'm using SQL Server transactional replication and looking for ideas on reducing the amount of downtime caused by re-initializing subscriptions.I have multiple publishers pushing data to a single subscriber across the WAN.  I recently had to recover the subscriber from backup.  Upon restoring the backup, the subscriber was out of sync with all of the publishers.  The only way I knew to get the subscriber back in sync with all of the publishers was to re-initialize all the subscriptions.Since the publishers and subscriber are separated by a WAN connection, this process was extremely time consuming.  In some cases it takes 24+ hours to generate a snapshot.  Any ideas on how to reduce the downtime caused by this type of scenario?  The only idea I have at this point is to use Always On with the subscriber.
