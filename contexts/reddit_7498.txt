Want a PhD... kinda lost on where to go?
Hi to anyone who is listening and willing to help. So I graduated with a Bachelors in ChemEng and I graduated with a 3.2 cum and 3.9 major gpa. I left school to see what industry looks like at this level and because I was a little scared about pursuing a PhD program. I wanted to know what I should be doing to get this acceptance? I currently am about 2 yrs  in industry and want to apply this December. I talked to two professors who would write a reco for me and I’m studying for the GRE and I have passed the FE and I’m licensed. I know academia is something I want to pursue I’m just looking for some advice and perspective really. I want to pursue a PhD in ChemEng with a focus on process engineering or kinetics depends on the program. I’ve been looking at a lot different schools and I want to know what do I to kinda focus in on 3/4 schools for me?
