KNOX: Nice snap, huh? Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
VICKI: His face. Allie, look at his face.
KNOX: Yep. He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop? Jim Gordon
VICKI: Oh, Bruce...
KNOX: Something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
VICKI: You are on drugs.
KNOX: Yeah? According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva. Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
VICKI: Are they paying you for all this?
KNOX: Everybody needs a hobby. You explain it, Vicki. He walks out on his own party. Half an hour later, who turns up? Batman. Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway. No place to change.
VICKI: Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
KNOX: ... Oh? Why is that, Vicki?
VICKI: He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. They would know.
KNOX: ... Okay, then, I have a confession to make. I'm the Batman.
VICKI: Alexander... I know you.

VICKI: I've had it with you. I'm leaving.
KNOX: Bruce Wayne is out of his mind. Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
