Take A Second To Look Around..
Do it, just take a second to look through this sub and look at all the people struggling to find a reason to live. Some people are fighting their hardest against impossible odds, some people never had a chance, some are nihilistic and don't see any reason to live and some like me have hereditary depression. And who cares? Genuinely who cares? I've come on here just to rant and I'd bet any amount of money you who's reading this did the exact same. Everyone is self absorbed, the only people who care about you (if any) can't help. They have their own lives to live. They beg people with depression and who are suicidal to "talk" well who do we fucking talk to? I don't have the money for a fancy fucking therapist, I honestly don't just feel sorry for myself right now.. I feel sorry for mankind. Do you think in a tribe if someone is crying they walk past them and pretend they didn't see them? For whatever reason this 21st century, though being the safest and most peaceful time in all of history. Is also some on the most uncaring, sociopathic fucked up times in history. Well... maybe not. Maybe the world has always been fucked and we just have selective memory. 

No-one cares about you, no-one cares about me. I wish I could look out the window and see a fucking meteorite screeching towards Earth. I'm done, I really don't know how I am going to get through Christmas this year so I might as well leave a trail so my family don't blame themselves if I do something. I doubt I will, I'm a pussy and too scared. So I'll just sit in my misery, watch another year come and wonder how I will survive this new year coming.
