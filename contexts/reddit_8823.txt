What policies have proven effective enough in other countries that they can be assembled into a "whole-of-government" response to climate change?
In a rather unexpected outcome, [SECDEF James Mattis stated](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/james-mattis-us-defence-secretary-climate-change-destabilise-world-security-donald-trump-global-a7630676.html) "I agree that the effects of a changing climate — such as increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels, desertification, among others — impact our security situation," that "climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today,” and that "climate change is a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of government response.”

While [somewhat unpopular in the GOP](http://www.gallup.com/poll/190010/concern-global-warming-eight-year-high.aspx), there are some prominent politicians within the GOP that affirm climate change.  For example, [Carly Fiorina's position was paraphrased by the National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/422395/carly-fiorina-climate-change-left): "If the scientific consensus is that man-made climate change is real, there is also consensus that America, acting alone, cannot stop it. Indeed, the Chinese are only too happy to watch us constrict our economy as they capture the market in clean coal."  Such a position, if valid, precludes the US government unilaterally passing climate change legislation that would be effectual.

Given these arguments, what would be a plausible "whole-of-government" response to climate change that would tackle what Mattis considers to be a national security threat?
