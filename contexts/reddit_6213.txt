New business wardrobe for start of a new job
Hi all, this is a little different from the typical post on here, but I thought there would likely be some good thoughts if I were to pick the brains of people on here.

I'm starting a new job starting the second week of December in a Finance Manager position in a university hospital department, and I've decided that I'll go back to wearing a suit and tie for work daily. It's not something I've done since I worked in the wealth management industry a few years back; in my last few roles I've worn semi-casual button-down shirts and khakis, but I think a suit would make a better impression and be more commensurate with the position when meeting with faculty or senior leadership, or if I end up hiring some staff in the future to work under me.

I've got one nice suit from Brooks Brothers which I interviewed in, but I'd like to get a new one (which isn't quite as expensive!) along with a half-dozen shirts--I'm pretty well stocked for ties still. Does anyone have any recommendations of places where I could get a good deal and the suit/shirts are of a decent quality? I've seen some nice suits in *Banana Republic*, and I walk past a *Jos A Bank* daily which always is advertising some good deals.

I figure that on Black Friday weekend too there could be the chance to get a great deal too...
