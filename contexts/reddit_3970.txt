I was given flowers by a woman!
So this girl and I had agreed to go out, Since I’m barely getting to know her I decided to take her to the Natural History Museum because she likes dinosaurs/paleontology. I don’t have a car, so she came to pick me up and suddenly she pulls out a bouquet of roses and says “these are for you.” I was in complete shock because I’ve never heard of a woman giving a guy roses, much less did I expect this to happen to me. She then added “can’t a woman give flowers to a guy.” I said “yeah...” Now my questions are have any of you guys received flowers from a woman?  
If so, what does this mean? I even googled these questions and I couldn’t find an answer. Just for context, she considers herself a feminist and as the day went on she kept emphasizing about “changing gender roles.”, “patriarchy” and, being a simple woman....
