If you’re getting mixed signals and you’re the one giving more energy, retract it and see what they do.
If you’re the one constantly messaging them or the only one who cares to make plans or else you don’t see each other.. or if their main communication is just viewing your story and replying to every other funny meme or thirst trap you post (guilty of trying 😬), just retract your energy and keep it moving. Go dead ass silent (literally don’t say anything or make a fuss... this does take a shit ton of self control and tact) and then you’ll see their true intentions... if they really care at all. I did that about 3 weeks ago and I haven’t heard from him since. I was confused for weeks, if not months about him because we had so much attraction and amazing sex. He even told me I was the best, gave the best head, I’d always think of him and grab food before I come over and even paid for our second date. If I could create a boyfriend for me, it would be him (goal oriented, hard worker, goofy, big downstairs lol). It really sucks when you want someone so badly, but you have to put logic before your feelings no matter how disappointing it is. 

Also, in my situation, if I reached out or asked him to hang... I always got a response instantly and was always a yes to hang out. It’s confusing and makes it harder to say “hey you’re just giving me the bare minimum” without sounding crazy, because they will just come back and make it seem like you overthink things. In my case, even though he told me he liked me and is very attracted to me there were a couple times he mentioned we could just be friends when I’d react emotionally (instead of being comforting or trying to work through things). If you pay attention, they may even tell you directly they aren’t ready to date or something, so don’t overlook it. Just listen to your gut. If it doesn’t feel right, then it’s not right. 

I saw a comment on a YouTube video that said girls get confused with this dynamic of overthinking and not understanding mixed signals, because we usually are the ones playing hard to get if we like a guy... but if a guy is doing it, it doesn’t mean the same thing and you should actually take it as he’s not as invested or interested enough.

I’m sure guys go through the same things, but this is just coming from your friendly single 29 year old female who’s been through a lot. 🤷🏻‍♀️
