Gateways to University
Hi made a throwaway for this and don't know if this is the right place to post this but I need advice. I'm 18 now in the UK. Got fair GCSE results B's and C's and went onto A level's which went abysmally with 2 U's and an E. So I'm about to finish a year of doing BTEC and this isn't looking good to me either. I want to go to university on a training course to become ODP (operating department practitioner) but I can't get on the course with the bad grades I've had and the general bad experience with education so far. What can I do next to get to university? Or should I move on and try and get a full time job? Before going onto anything else I am going to finish this course and see what I get from it. If this is in the wrong subreddit could someone please direct me to somewhere more appropriate for it. Thanks in advance.
