GORDO: You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
JAKE: Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
MILES: Is it all fugasi?
JAKE: No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
LILY: What about Customs?
JAKE: I'll worry about Customs.
LILY: Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
JAKE: Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
KING PIN: How much?
JAKE: I think two million.
KING PIN: What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
JAKE: I need you to stake me.
KING PIN: Stake you?
JAKE: I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
KING PIN: That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
JAKE: Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
KING PIN: Hey Skippy? Do I have the word chump" tattooed on my forehead?"
LILY: Mr. King, I think --
JAKE: Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
KING PIN: Listen, Scooter --
JAKE: No, you listen. We're partners now and even though I'm running the show for you, I'm still running the show. That means I get a little respect. So I don't want to hear anymore of this Scooter, Buddy, Junior, Skippy, Tiger, bullshit. It's Jake. And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.
