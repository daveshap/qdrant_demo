Why couldn't Aragorn become one of the Eldar? Canonically, Arwen elects for a mortal life, linking her fate to the Doom of Man. In doing so, she's the second elf to do so, after Luthien Tinuviel. My question is this: Why couldn't Aragorn have been granted immortality, and have his fate tied to the Firstborn? There is precedent for this as well--Luthien and Beren were not the only inter-species marriage in history: Luthien's parents were an Elf and a Maia (both immortal, and therefore irrelevant), and Luthien and Beren's granddaughter, Idril Celebrindal (\"half-elven\" in the same was as Elrond but counted among the Eldar) married a human (Tuor, son of Huor). Interestingly, both Aragorn and Arwen are directly descended from all three of these couples. The important note is that Tuor was able to become counted among the Eldar, due to his marriage to Idril, and his abiding love of Elvenkind. Couldn't the same have happened for Aragorn?Other Notes:I understand that thematically Aragorn represents the coming of the Dominion of Men, so his Fate is sealed, so to speak. And he may well have felt more kinship for Man than for Elves. But in-universe, would he have had a choice? Could Arwen and Aragorn have talked things through and decided that either mortality or immortality was right for them and their descendants? Or was Arwen choosing mortality really the only way their fates could have been linked? Could he have ruled as king for a reasonable span of years and then taken a ship into the West with Arwen?
