Are inexperienced girls unattractive to guys? How do I do a better job of putting myself out there?
So I have a two part question: 
1. I (24F) have never been in a relationship. I haven’t even had my first kiss and I’ve never been on a date before. As I get older I’m starting to worry that my lack of experience may be a turn off to guys. Is that something I should be worried about? 
2. I’m pretty shy and reserved when I first meet a guy, especially if I’m attracted to him, so I find that sometimes they can have a hard time connecting with me. People have suggested dating apps to me, but I’m not interested in dating apps as I get anxious for my safety when it comes to meeting strangers on the internet. Also, I don’t want to lead anyone on when I have no intention of meeting them in person. Does anyone have any advice for how I can put myself out there and meet guys in real life?
