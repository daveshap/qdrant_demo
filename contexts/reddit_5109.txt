Is it just me or is it unusually difficult to get a job?
I am a recent university grad in the US and I majored in Political Science (I know a lot of people say that there aren't ba while lot of job opportunities in Political Science anyway blah blah blah but it still seems just as difficult for people with other degrees. Plus I feel like your degree doesn't necessarily mean you can't get a particular job considering people have jobs in fields they didn't major in all the time) but anyway, I just graduated in August and almost every day I've been sending out apps. I know I just graduated but I find it a little worrying that I haven't gotten ANYTHING yet. Nothing but getting ghosted and rejections. At first I thought it was my degree, but tbh I don't think the degree plays much of a factor here outside of just having it to show that you completed University. It just seems like it's hard for a lot of people to get jobs these days regardless of the degree especially right out of school, unless you're lucky. Is that just me? Are millennials really ruining the job market (lol)? Maybe I'm just not spending enough time plugging apps. I don't know. In any case, it's a bit depressing.
