DOMINO: So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
ED: I was a musician.
DOMINO: Really? Did you play in a band?
ED: Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
DOMINO: I... <i>love...</i> Pat Benatar.
ED: Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
DOMINO: Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
ED: We dated off and on for two years. But life on the road is tough. The pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.
DOMINO: How did you meet Choco?
ED: I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
ED: Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
CHOCO: <i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
ED: Fuckin' A! We got a five hour drive back to LA ahead of us. <b> EXT. MACDONALD'S -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back PARKING LOT of the MacDonald's. Alf is hosing him down. Domino stares at Choco... admiring his body.
