MARTIN: So what happened to you?
PAUL: Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
MARTIN: Fair enough.
PAUL: God it's great to see you.
MARTIN: You too.
