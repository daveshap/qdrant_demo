BENNETT: Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief. Things need straightening up in this city.
GALLAGHER: What'cha got, Bennett?
BENNETT: Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model. I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
GALLAGHER: Technothugs?
BENNETT: No chance. Not their sector. They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show. Something else. Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood. One Manny Turner. Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
GALLAGHER: I can smell it.
