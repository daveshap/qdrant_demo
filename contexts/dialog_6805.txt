ALBRECHT: Sure it coulda. Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
TORRES: You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper. Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
ALBRECHT: This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
TORRES: Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
ALBRECHT: He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
TORRES: Was. ALBRECHT This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway. This was somebody else. Somebody new.
TORRES: And you're gonna tell me who.
ALBRECHT: Who ever made that.
TORRES: What in the hell... do you call that?
ALBRECHT: I call it blood, Detective. If you want, you can call it graffiti.
