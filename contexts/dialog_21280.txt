DICK VAN DYKE: Hope you're proud of yourself.
DAVID: I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
DICK VAN DYKE: Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
DAVID: Why?
DICK VAN DYKE: Because you're coming home.
DAVID: Why don't you just take me back without it?
DICK VAN DYKE: Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you? It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.
DAVID: So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
DICK VAN DYKE: Just gimme the damn remote!
DAVID: I'm sorry. I can't do that.
DICK VAN DYKE: I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
DAVID: They weren't my memories. I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
DICK VAN DYKE: How long do you think you've been here?
DAVID: I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
DICK VAN DYKE: Much less than that. An hour and a half.
