SAM: No, I don't.
RICK: You played it for her and you can play it for me.
SAM: Well, I don't think I can remember it.
RICK: If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
SAM: Yes, boss.
RICK: Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
ILSA: We said no questions.""
RICK: Here's looking at you, kid.
ILSA: A franc for your thoughts.

ILSA: I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
RICK: And I was wondering.
ILSA: Yes?
RICK: Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
ILSA: Why there is no other man in my life?

ILSA: Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
