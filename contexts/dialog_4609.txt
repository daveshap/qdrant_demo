MICKEY: No, Cease. There was no answer.
CAESAR: I thought I heard someone knocking.
MICKEY: I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
CAESAR: Yeah, it was Violet's idea. I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
MICKEY: That Violet is one nice lady. Wish someone would help me relax.
CAESAR: Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink. Sit down, Lou.
MICKEY: We was worried about you, Cease.
CAESAR: Me? Why?
MICKEY: We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
MICKEY: I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal. I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
CAESAR: Oh Christ, the phone ... That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
MICKEY: Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, I'd probably do the same thing.
MICKEY: Cease, can I ask you something?
CAESAR: Yeah.
MICKEY: Why'd you move all the furniture around?
