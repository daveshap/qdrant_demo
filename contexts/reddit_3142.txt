I have too much freedom at work and don’t know what to do with it. How can I structure my day and do more with my time?
Too much freedom, no direction or motivation

Help, I have a job that affords me the luxury of complete autonomy to make my own schedule and generate my own work to do but I can’t figure out how to be productive and end up sitting around all day doing nothing. I’m sure to some people this sounds great but I feel worthless and useless and want to feel productive. How do I motivate myself to use my time?

I’m an environmental educator and my primary responsibility is to be a face at various events to talk to the community about the environment and how to deal with any wildlife related issues they might have. However these events aren’t too frequent and I have between 20-40 hours a WEEK to try to use.  My boss has given me complete freedom to work on creating new programs, create events, etc but I don’t have a clue where to start. I’m not an event coordinator by trade, I’m a wildlife naturalist and educator so I’m really struggling... 

Can anyone give me tips on how to make my time more productive and motivate myself to do more? Should I ask my employer for more structure? I’m afraid of causing concern and then over correcting and micromanaging me...

Thanks for any advice
