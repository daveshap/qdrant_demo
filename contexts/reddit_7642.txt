Third letter Writer MIA
Hi all, I need some advice.

So, I’ve submitted almost all of my applications for my doctorate. The first deadline was last night and submitted on Wednesday. That’s the first part.

I asked my recommenders over the summer and they were on board. I’ve stayed in contact since with periodic reminder emails. Last week, I noticed that my third letter writer had still not submitted her letter. So I emailed. She is notoriously bad at emailing. No response. After I submitted I sent another reminder email. No response. 

The first application was due at midnight last night. She still hasn’t submitted so I sent an email. At 7:00pm, still no letter, so I sent another email marked as priority and a very clear subject line. I begged her to email me back.

Nothing.

So I spoke with some of her other advisees and they suggested I shoot her a text because she’s more likely to read that. 

So at 10:00 I sent her a text explaining the situation, apologizing, and asking her to please get the letter in.

Nothing. Now it’s the morning after and she hasn’t responded or submitted. There are two more applications that have a TODAY deadline.

I’m at a loss at what to do right now. I also feel I have to tread water carefully because she is also my thesis advisor.

Do I go above her head? Do I wait it out? Am I screwed completely? 

Help.
