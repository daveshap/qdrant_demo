NARCISSUS: When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family. You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
SELENE: No!
SELENE: You're not going! You have to stay with us!
NARCISSUS: How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power? A month? Half a year? Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
SELENE: Narcissus!
NARCISSUS: Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered? If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
SELENE: I don't want you to die!
NARCISSUS: I'll never die. You tell the girls that. You honor our ancestors and I'll be there. Every night. At the table of life.
SELENE: Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
NARCISSUS: They'll have me. Teach them. Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans. Teach them, who we are!
SELENE: You teach them!
NARCISSUS: That's what I'm going to do. That's what I'm going to do...
