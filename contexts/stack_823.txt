Installation of Windows 10 & Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 18.04 & Windows 10 I have installed Windows 10 and then Ubuntu 18.04, I can see grub and able to choose between the OS's.Later after somedays, I have installed Ubuntu 18.04 First and then Windows 10, this time system is directly booting to windows 10. But i observed that my linux partitions are there and all data is available. Only thing is it is not showing grub, booting directly to Windows. How can i resolve this. I prefer not to install any software or using shift key all the time to select between OS's.
