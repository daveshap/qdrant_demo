How do you stop constant job rejections effecting your mental health?
I got a great Master’s degree from a great university, I’ve done volunteering, co-ran a record label for over 2 years, my career advice group from my university say my cv and cover letters look great but I still keep getting constantly rejected. I had an interview that I felt went great a couple weeks ago but got rejected and no feedback as to why. This is the rejection that has really cut me up.

I KNOW I have the ability to be a great employee and have lots of great attributes but no employer can see this and it’s starting to cause havoc on my mental health. I’ve done all the hard work through university and beyond and it all feels worthless. I feel worthless. How do I get out of this mental black hole? How do you stop the constant rejection impacting your mental health?
