WALLACE: Sorry, Cowan, I found out literally just before the ceremony.' Apparently you're to report for further review.
COWAN: Further... what are you talking about, air? That makes no sense-- I hold three cadet class records--
WALLACE: Actually, it didn't come from me.
COWAN: Bull... loney- Sir. I'm sorry. Sir, I'm sorry. Sir. I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you. I mean, everything here comes from you.
WALLACE: Well this didn't.
COWAN: Then where did it-- ? Sir. Forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
WALLACE: Look. I don't know why. I could guess, however. Maybe it's your attitude. Or that you're not even close to a team player. Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
COWAN: Actually, sir--
WALLACE: Cowan. Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
COWAN: All the time, sir.
WALLACE: You do?
COWAN: Yes, air. But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
