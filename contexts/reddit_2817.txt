How do you stay positive after countless rejections?
I graduated in May but I've been applying for jobs since March. I've applied to 200+ jobs now and I've only had a handful of interviews and they've all ended in rejections. The biggest blow to my self esteem came this week when I was rejected for an entry level cold calling job, a position I was foolish enough to think was beneath me. How do I keep my head up? I know it's too early to be giving up but every day truly is a struggle. I graduated with a good deal of motivation and optimism but this last rejection really just knocked it out of me. It’s difficult to see value in myself when employers don’t see value in me.
