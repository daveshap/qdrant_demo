NORA: No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
MELVIN: Absolutely.
NORA: Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
MELVIN: Sure thing.
NORA: You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
MELVIN: Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here."
CAROL: There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
BEVERLY: Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
CAROL: It lets a crazy man into our lives.
BEVERLY: Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
