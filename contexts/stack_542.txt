Is there a way to improve Super+<Number> reliability? I'm very much used to the Windows+Number shortcuts from Windows. Unity allows me to keep this habit, but it doesn't work very reliably for me.The problem is that sometimes instead of switching windows, the currently active window receives the number input and then the unity search opens. After closing the search and undoing unwanted edits, the second time the shortcut always reliably works.At first I thought that I wasn't hitting the keys in the right order or not holding the Windows key long enough, but as I got slower and more careful over many weeks, the issue would not disappear.At this point, asking this question might be more time efficient than enduring this behavior (depending on the answers!).Is there a way to improve the reliability of this keyboard shortcut? It seems to me that some background listening service is asleep and misses the keys, because it always works the second time.
