How to discover known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Go executables? Tools that discover CVEs need to create software bill-of-material. In many cases it can be done simply by inspecting files on the target system e.g. RPM or NPM index.Would it be possible to do composition analysis on Go executables in contrast to Go source code? Is there any tools attempting to do that?edit: the question is about executables programmed in go language in general and how to automatically discover transitive dependencies of those executables as part of executing vulnerability scan for a target system.
