If you gotta think too much about doing it, it's not worth doing
When it comes to relationships, dating, hooks ups, whatever, if you're constantly driving yourself nuts replaying scenarios, scrutinizing behavior, surveilling the person, or figuring them out by way of "clues" or some shit, it's just not worth it. You're not gonna live forever, so giving people undue time and attention is really, really just not worth it lol. Cut people off. Be unceremonious about it. Block people, delete numbers. Who tf cares, it's your life, you gotta look out for yourself first and foremost. If someone is fucking up your peace of mind get rid of them as easily as possible.
