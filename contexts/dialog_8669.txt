MIERZWIAK: Okay, we're back in.
MARY: That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
MIERZWIAK: Well, thank you, Mary.
STAN: You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
MIERZWIAK: Yeah, probably a good idea.
CLEMENTINE: But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
JOEL: Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
CLEMENTINE: Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
JOEL: They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
CLEMENTINE: Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
STAN: Howard, they've disappeared again.
MIERZWIAK: Oh dear.
