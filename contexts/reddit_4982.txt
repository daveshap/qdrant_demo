I'm Unable to Receive Love Even When I Crave it So Badly
I really can't receive love when it's about to come to my way. I don't know why my first instinct when someone put their interest to me is to freak out or push them away. And it's not because I don't like them, in fact I really want love from someone and to be loved back.. I'm sure it'd feel amazing and will make me feel great even. But everytime that happen or I can sense it's about to happen I shut myself, I close myself up. I don't think I'm worth of their love, if they really know who I am they won't stay around for so long. I feel like I'm not worthy, no one will actually be proud to have me. I'm not even proud of myself right now.

Maybe it's true that you need to love yourself first to be able to love others. But honestly, how do you do it? What to love about me when all I see is disappointment in myself? I don't ever feel great about myself. Is there a person that want to be with someone that keep looking down at themselves like this? No one will have the patience to wait someone that barely look at themselves in a good light or wait to open themselves up. Why would they even try, I rather not waste their time.
