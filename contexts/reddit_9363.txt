Unexpected and most fortuitous windfall
After 4 years, I was finally able to pay my utility bills on time for a full year, so I'm getting a refund of my $160 deposit! I have $0 bill this month and a $79 credit on next month! WOO HOO! 

$81 (for this month) doesn't sound like a lot, but it will buy me a few things I need and also give me some extra money to spend for my son's visit. Then next month, I can put that $79 in savings.  

Thank you, universe, for this timely gift!
