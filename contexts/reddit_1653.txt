Just had the cutest interaction with my mailman...
OKAY SO! Some people on here talked about wondering what their mailmen/mailwomen think while delivering their acceptance letters and I was just walking to work and mine STOPPED ME AND ASKED ME IF I WAS THE ONE AT MY ADDRESS GETTING THE LETTERS AH OMFG! And he asked me where I was going and I said Notre Dame and he was like “over Hopkins?” and I explained why but either way that was the CUTEST THING EVER.
