NORRINGTON: I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow. The island is riddled with caves. I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
JACK: Funny, I was thinking along those lines. How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
NORRINGTON: You would do that?
JACK: They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?
NORRINGTON: Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
JACK: I knew you'd listen to reason!
JACK: That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
NORRINGTON: I'll be at the wheel myself.
JACK: I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
PINTEL: No reason to fret. It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
BARBOSSA: Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins. Best play it safe, and spill it all.
PINTEL: I guess there is a reason to fret.
