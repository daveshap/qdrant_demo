BUFF: It's safe, come on.
NAZEER: That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
JEFF: Why we're just standing here.
NAZEER: Look, your trespassing.
BUFF: Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
NAZEER: Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
