JEZZIE: It's just me.
JACOB: Jezzie?
JEZZIE: Who else were you expecting?
JACOB: Let go!
JEZZIE: Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
JACOB: Stay away from me, Jez.
JEZZIE: I want to know. You tell me!
JACOB: You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
JEZZIE: Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
JACOB: I can do anything I want.
JACOB: Don't!
JEZZIE: It might be for me.
JACOB: I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
JEZZIE: Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what? Vietnam? ... What experiments?
