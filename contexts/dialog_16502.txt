PETE: Yeah? what did they want?
BILL: They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.

CLAIRE: We saw you that night, Pete.
BILL: You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
PETE: Sheila?
BILL: Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
PETE: What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
CLAIRE: We know that.
PETE: Who was the man?
BILL: Never saw him before in my life.
PETE: Did you tell the police this?
BILL: We're not saying anything about that night to the police. We should all forget that night.
PETE: What happened to me?
PETE: Please tell me.
BILL: No.
