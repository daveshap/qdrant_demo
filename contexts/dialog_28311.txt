HEALY: A girl after your own heart, Ted.
JOANIE: I can live with those reflections.
MARY: I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
JOANIE: Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
MARY: But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
