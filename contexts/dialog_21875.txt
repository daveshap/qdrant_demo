JEFF: Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!

JEFF: If anything, I'm making it sound good. Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
