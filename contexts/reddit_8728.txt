Why did Republicans/pro-life supporters oppose Trump's comments about punishing women who get illegal abortions?
Last week, Donald Trump received criticism for his statement about [punishing women who receive illegal abortions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/03/30/trump-if-abortions-were-banned-women-who-seek-them-would-face-punishment/?tid=a_inl). Criticism emerged from both [democrat and republican presidential candidates](http://www.people.com/article/donald-trump-abortion-backlash-hillary-clinton-ted-cruz).  

Cruz's criticism and the [concern from the Republican party](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/31/politics/trump-abortion-punishment-republicans-clinton/) seem to be at odds with the pro-life belief commonly held in the Republican party. If someone is pro-life, they believe life begins at conception. Wouldn't assisting in the taking of a life (with the help of a doctor) be akin to being an accomplice to murder? Why has the party focused on policies to punish doctors and not women who get abortions? It appears to be an ideological inconsistency in beliefs.
