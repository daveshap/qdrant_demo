DAVID: Can't this thing go any faster?
MOISHE: You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.

MOISHE: And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
DAVID: Dad...
MOISHE: All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.
