LOUISE: Oh, I don't know. I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
THELMA: Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
LOUISE: Just what the hell is wrong with you?
THELMA: What do you mean?
LOUISE: Why are you actin' like this?
THELMA: Actin' like what?! How am I supposed to act? 'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
LOUISE: You could help me try and figure it out! I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
THELMA: I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
LOUISE: Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...! Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet. Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
THELMA: Give me the keys.
LOUISE: You're not touchin' that car.
THELMA: My stuff's in the trunk! God! You care more about that car than you do about most people.
LOUISE: Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
