EXECUTIVE: Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
MR. THOMERSON: Any time, Al.
MR. THOMERSON: Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
COLE: The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
MR. THOMERSON: Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
COLE: 1002.
MR. THOMERSON: All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself. You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
COLE: Yes, sir.
RICK: Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
LARRY: It's Bullwinkle.
