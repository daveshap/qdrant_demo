KANE: What do you mean by that?
LELAND: Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor. What do you think that crowd is doing down there? They think you murdered him.
KANE: Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the Enquirer" in his pocket?"
LELAND: - and that copy of the Enquirer" said the President should be killed."
KANE: I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
LELAND: You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
KANE: They're true! Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
LELAND: Charlie!
KANE: Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks - Nobody can blame me because -
LELAND: Look out that window.
LELAND: There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
KANE: What lesson? Not to expose fraud when I see it? Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property? Run it the way I said, Reilly - This afternoon a great man was assassinated -""
LELAND: Charlie! Now you're not making sense.
KANE: I don't have to. I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that. Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece. I've got to think of her.
LELAND: What?
KANE: I've got to think of Emily -
LELAND: I'd like to talk to you about that.
KANE: Go ahead.
