KAUFMAN: Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
PRESIDENT: Oh? What?
KAUFMAN: We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
PRESIDENT: Good. Anything else?
KAUFMAN: Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
