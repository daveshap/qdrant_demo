Summer Internships - Higher Education
I start my grad program tomorrow for Educational Counseling and I have goals of becoming a Student Affairs professional.

I do plan on meeting with my schools Career Services department, although wanted to ask advice on how to go about finding/applying to summer internships? I know of AUCHO-I, but I'm looking for more direct student engagement experiences within Higher Education.

Thanks in advance!
