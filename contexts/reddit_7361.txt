I did it! I negotiated my contract - I got a 25% increase on the initial offer + training for certs.
Hey Guys, 

Im a long time lurker and for months i have been picking up some of your advice, so thank you for all you that contribute to this sub. I have fortunately always been employed but recently after being redundant, I have job hopped a few times and got stuck in companies that don't push me, nor pay me adequately for my skills. I work in a county that is full of smaller companies that don't appreciate IT security and infrastructure and all the big players are moving out as its cheaper to set up elsewhere. Well after months of searching, 100's of applications and 10+ interviews I finally found a company who was willing to pay me the going rate. 

I initially got offered the job but 10% under the advertised salary with promise of getting that 10% after 12 months. However I retorted that for the job they require me to do, what they are offering well under the going rate for someone in that position elsewhere. I advised the recruiter of some sources that prove this (itjobswatch, etc). I also had an advantage of knowing that they have been without that role for over 4 months and there IT was in a bad state so I knew I could play hard ball. 

Anyway they rejected my counter-offer last Friday so I rejected their offer entirely. However today I got called by the recruiter saying they are desperate for someone like me and the MD has agreed to my counter-offer plus certification training. So happy days!

So apart from sharing this with you and hopefully giving you some hope that this can be done, I will share some of my experiences:

-For those of you that have a job already, be prepared to be comfortable for as long as it takes in that role until you find one you really like.

-Don't always go for the first offer you get, weigh up the benefits, travel, extra costs, also the feeling you get from other employees when you walk around

- Be patient, some weeks I sent 5 - 10 applications and got 0 back and other weeks I sent 1 and got a callback. 

- Don't sell your self short, do some research of what others doing your role are getting paid and use that to leverage 

- Go in with 'nothing to lose' and be confident. Remember they NEED YOU, so put your big boy pants on, research the role, apply that to your current skills

- Turn the interview into a conversation, ask questions and don't be afraid to interrupt when appropriate when they are asking you questions. Try and relate these questions to what you are being asked so conversation flows smoothly.

- Do not rehearse answers to questions, get some facts about the company and research the role and memorise them but don't memorise them in structured sentences as it comes of non-genuine.

- It's OK to pass on questions you don't know - just be honest

- For some of you this is hard because you've been out searching for so long but be positive, show you are enthusiastic even if you have to 'fake it to make it'.
