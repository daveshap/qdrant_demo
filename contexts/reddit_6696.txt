Question: Working with more than 1 recruitment agency for positions in same company?
Hi, hope I used the right flair. I'm in a bit of a dilemma. So first off, I'm not very familiar with working with recruitment agencies so I'm not sure what the usual etiquette is. Omitting some details for confidentiality. **TLDR at the bottom**

&nbsp;

I had my resume and details uploaded to a job board for a while, and a few days ago, Agency A reached out to me and said I seemed to be a good fit for a job, X, at a large company. Note that I didn't apply for the position before Agency A reached out to me. Now this company is... definitely known nationwide, and they're very prominent in their field. 

&nbsp;

I was able to talk with Agency A a few days ago, about the position and other details. For where things are now, Agency A has forwarded my information to the hiring manager of the company, and are waiting to hear back. The next step, if the hiring manager approves, is an onsite interview. Overall Agency A seems to be larger and has been around longer, has more reviews, but seem to be based in a different state.

&nbsp;

But today around the afternoon, I got a call by Agency B... for a slightly different position, but at the same exact company and same location - **However**, at the time I applied, their listing didn't say the name of the company - they just said the location of the position. I applied to the position via Agency B *before* I first talked with Agency A on Wednesday. Agency B is smaller and newer, but unlike Agency A they're local to the general area they recruit for. 

&nbsp;

In my call with Agency B, **that's** when they told me "The position's at (large company)". I could've gleaned that from context clues in their listing but wasn't 100% sure. But TBH, I wasn't expecting to hear back from Agency B because I applied through them before and never heard back.

&nbsp;

I googled around and most people are saying that it's not a good idea to have multiple recruitment agencies represent you for positions in the same company... aka double-dipping. The two positions are in the same department I think but not exactly the same, so I'm imagining that the recruiters would be talking with the same hiring manager, which after googling is not a good idea and the hiring manager would likely get confused about who is actually representing me. But since the company is so large, I'm wondering if that would make any difference vs. if it were a smaller company where the hiring manager for sure would be the same?

&nbsp;

I'm just not sure how to proceed with things... do I tell both agencies? Do I stick with one agency and drop the other? AhhHHh. I just don't want to accidentally end up burning bridges with anyone.

&nbsp;

**TLDR**:

-Agency A got to me first for the position at a large company by finding my resume through a job board

-I applied to Agency B *before* I talked with Agency A

-I wasn't aware at the time which company Agency B was recruiting for until they called me

-I got a call back from Agency B *after* I already talked with Agency A and got things rolling

-Agency A and Agency B are recruiting for the same exact company

-The positions are slightly different but chances are very high they're in the same department with the same hiring manager

-... What should I do now?
