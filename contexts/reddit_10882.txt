“Death is permanent you can’t come back”
It’s amazing to me how many people say this sort of thing to stop someone from wanting to kill themself. 

Don’t you get it? That’s the point. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to change my mind. Do you really think I’m so delusional that I believe I’ll die then decide I could have lived longer and come back? Are you really so delusional you don’t see I want to die because it means I won’t be coming back?
