ANABEL: Where are you going?
CASANOVA: Head hunting.
MONICA: I admire you.
FURIOUS: Why?
MONICA: Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
FURIOUS: It is?
MONICA: Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
FURIOUS: I wouldn't mind being famous.
MONICA: Who wouldn't?
MONICA: I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
FURIOUS: Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
MONICA: What's your real name?
FURIOUS: Roy.
MONICA: Have you always lived here?
MONICA: Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
FURIOUS: It's home.
MONICA: Yeah.
MONICA: I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
FURIOUS: What have they got that we ain't got?
MONICA: Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
FURIOUS: Me, too.
MONICA: You don't seem very angry right now.
MONICA: You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
FURIOUS: I just want to be a superhero.
MONICA: That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.
