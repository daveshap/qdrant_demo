Gradient boosting regression trained on skewed data My target feature is right-skewed.I want to apply gradient boosting regression algorithm to predict it but I'm not sure what kind of preprocessing should I apply. As gradient boosting is based on decision trees the common intuition declares that logarithmic transformation won't help much. Another way is to remove outliers based on a threshold and to look at the performance of the model. But I'm not sure this is an optimal solution.Any suggestion?
