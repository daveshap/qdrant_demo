ELECTRA: Listen -- I don't even know your name.
RATH: Rath. Robert Rath.
ELECTRA: Electra.
RATH: Just Electra?
ELECTRA: Yeah.
RATH: As in daughter of Agamemnon?
ELECTRA: No. Just Electra.
ELECTRA: What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
RATH: What do you want to know?
ELECTRA: If Bain hadn't taken the contract on me, would you have?
RATH: No.
ELECTRA: Why?
RATH: Because I'm done.
ELECTRA: This is crazy. I can't trust you. You can't trust me. How can we possibly help each other?
