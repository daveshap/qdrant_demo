LAO: An unexpected pleasure.
TOP DOLLAR: Bad news. Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me. Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
LAO: Who got himself what?
TOP DOLLAR: One of mine. And it wasn't a standard hit.
LAO: I had heard something like this. Describe it for me. The hit"."
TOP DOLLAR: I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
LAO: I know of no one. But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
TOP DOLLAR: Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
LAO: To be sure. Now tell how your friend died.
