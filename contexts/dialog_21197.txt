GORE: This is the shell. What about the gun?
KILLAINE: Well. What about it?
GORE: I've handled it. Mitchell's handed it. If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide. If I leave it here....no suicide.
KILLAINE: So?
GORE: I've got to find a way to handle it, openly. Like Brandon.
GORE: How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
KILLAINE: He could have tried. If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it. If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
GORE: And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
KILLAINE: If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
GORE: No suicide.
KILLAINE: Did we ever really think it was suicide?
GORE: You win, Inspector. You win all along the line. Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us. Yeah. Of course you did. When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
KILLAINE: And a motive--which we haven't got. So this could all be a dream.
