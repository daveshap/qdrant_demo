GENE: There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
ELEANOR GRANT: I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
GENE: It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
ELEANOR GRANT: I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
GENE: This? I've never even fired one.
ELEANOR GRANT: Indeed.
