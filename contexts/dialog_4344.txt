MICHAEL: Bar across the street.
CAROLYN: Have you called Betty? Maybe you should.
MICHAEL: I found out who Lucy Delaney is. Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
CAROLYN: Yeah. But I thought she died.
MICHAEL: He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
CAROLYN: You mean -- she didn't like sex?
MICHAEL: I bet mom could've helped her.
CAROLYN: Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
MICHAEL: Not yet. You want to go?
CAROLYN: I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
MICHAEL: I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
CAROLYN: You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
MICHAEL: Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her exploring" stage."
CAROLYN: I never knew that.
MICHAEL: Nobody did.
CAROLYN: Was this during Betty?
MICHAEL: Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
CAROLYN: Did we want to?
MICHAEL: Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?""
CAROLYN: What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
MICHAEL: Carolyn!
CAROLYN: -- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
MICHAEL: What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
CAROLYN: You're right -- that is sick.
