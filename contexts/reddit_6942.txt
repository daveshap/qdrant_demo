I left work on Friday expecting to be fired. But it’s Sunday evening and I’m expecting to go to work tomorrow. I need some advice.
So I recently started working at this sales/fundraising company in the last couple weeks. The job isn’t the worst, I sit around and raise money for high school athletic departments across the country, but it’s a lot of calling and emailing and tedious work. 

In the middle of the office, there is a computer that has a huge excel sheet up with everyone’s numbers from the month and it is controlled by hq in a different state, so we can only look at it. However, I noticed a trend that throughout certain days, people that were not meeting numbers had an asterisk* appear next to there name, and the next day they did not show up for work, so I assumed they were fired. 

I have been working hard the last week but haven’t made a sale recently, and on Friday I saw the ill fated asterisk appear next to my name. I wasn’t surprised since it had been a tough week and so I left work on Friday fully expecting to receive a call from HR with the news of termination. However, I haven’t received any news over the weekend so I’m prepared to go to work tomorrow as if all is normal. 

I’m not fully sure what to do. Would be very uncomfortable if I shows up tomorrow and they had given my desk to someone else or weren’t expecting me to come in. Does anyone have any advice?
