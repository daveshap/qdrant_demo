JAKE: I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
MANAGER: Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
JAKE: I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
MANAGER: Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
JAKE: Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
MANAGER: Hold it, mister.
JAKE: What do you think of that? Or this?
