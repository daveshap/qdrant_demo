CAPTAIN: He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment. He's been doing it for quite a while. Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
MILLS: What about the trace on his bank account and the guns? There must be something to connect him with a past.
CAPTAIN: So far it's all dead ends. No credit history. No employment history. His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash. We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane. We may never know how he got that way.
SOMERSET: Because he is John Doe, by choice.
MILLS: When do we get to question him?
CAPTAIN: You don't. It goes to court now.
MILLS: He wouldn't just turn himself in. It doesn't make any sense.
CAPTAIN: Well, there he sits. It's not supposed to make sense.
SOMERSET: He's not finished.
MILLS: He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.
CAPTAIN: You're wound too tight, Mills. Let it go.
MILLS: You know he's fucking us.
SOMERSET: You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement. He wouldn't just stop.
MILLS: Well... what the fuck, man?
SOMERSET: He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right? Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next? I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
MILLS: No.
SOMERSET: I can tell you this. I recognize his lawyer. His name's Mark Swarr.
