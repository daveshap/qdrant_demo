STRASSER: How about New York?
RICK: Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
STRASSER: Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
RICK: I haven't the slightest idea.
RENAULT: Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
STRASSER: You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
