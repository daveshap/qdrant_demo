Should America move away from a First Past the Post voting system?
As we have seen for decades deadlocked government in the United states has been a major issue. The two parties that wield all the influence in our nation have become more [polarized](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/) as their electorates become more frustrated with the government.

As we have seen this election the polarization of the electorate has become particularly intense as presidential candidates have been using the anger of the electorate to gain support. Both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders,in their own ways, have been using populist anger to gain a massive amount of support this election cycle.

However, [half of Americans still don't think that their vote matters](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/04/half-of-those-who-arent-learning-about-the-election-feel-their-vote-doesnt-matter/) in this election and coupled with only a [small minority that actually trusts our government](http://www.people-press.org/2015/11/23/beyond-distrust-how-americans-view-their-government/), people just aren't satisfied. Personally, I believe that shouldn't happen in a nation that [many pride ](http://dailysignal.com/2015/07/04/are-americans-still-patriotic-what-polls-reveal/)  as the best in the world. If anything the fact that our constitutional republic, the government that is supposed to be by the people and for the people has such [low approval ratings](http://www.gallup.com/poll/171992/americans-losing-confidence-branches-gov.aspx) shows a fundamental flaw in our democracy.

The flaw seems to be in the one of the most fundamental aspects of our voting system, First past the post. [The problems with FPTP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo) are commonly known. [Gerrymandering](http://politicsandpolicy.org/article/gerrymandering-proving-all-politics-local), where the parties in control can redraw the districts in their favor so that even if they do not get the majority of the vote they can still win the election. The spoiler effect, the idea that even if a third party gained massive amounts of popularity they would only take [away votes from the major party that have the most in common](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/the-midterm-elections-spoilers/382475/) with and will lead to the other major party succeeding leading to the third party never gaining the same level of support. These issues lead to the rise of only two political parties, which are [umbrella parties for a range of political beliefs](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/01/a-closer-look-at-who-identifies-as-democrat-and-republican/), which don't really satisfy anyone. 

So should we change from FPTP to another type of voting system? Would it change the deadlock we see in American government today?

[ Also for anyone interested here is an opinion piece I found that was interesting and provided a look at America with a new type of voting system though it was written 20 years ago so the ideas on the parties would probably change.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/01/a-closer-look-at-who-identifies-as-democrat-and-republican/)
