Dating advice for women (Male perspective)
1. Exclusively having pictures from your neck up sends most of us a message that you are uncomfortable with your body.

2. Using the same pose in every picture equates to you being a basic beezy to many men.

3. Duck lips are still not attractive to a lot of men.

4. If you open the conversation on us, you'll set yourself far apart from the pack in some of our eyes.

5. If you can kick our ass, it only makes some of us like you more.

6. A lot of guys still think y'all want that Disney Princess stuff to happen to you, and see it as an abysmal task.

7. We have no idea what you're thinking of EVER, we just get lucky with our guesses sometimes.

8. If we ask about food, at least say something that has a broad scope, sometimes i.e. Mexican food, Chinese, etc. Or anything better than idc

9. Some men like it when you can talk shit with them.

10. Lastly, don't be a starfish.

Cheers!
