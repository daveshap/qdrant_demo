FATHER: Not the way to talk to people.
TENZIN GYATSO: Can I do anything I want?
FATHER: No.
TENZIN GYATSO: But, I am in charge.
FATHER: Are you? Of whom?
TENZIN GYATSO: Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
LOBSANG: You could buy them.
TENZIN GYATSO: Do I have money?
LOBSANG: What do you think?
TENZIN GYATSO: Do you have money?
FATHER: I do, now.
TENZIN GYATSO: And you have horses? You love horses.
FATHER: I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
TENZIN GYATSO: Will you buy the sheep for me?
FATHER: Where will you keep them?
TENZIN GYATSO: Here. We'll collect them.
FATHER: I will buy them for you.
TENZIN GYATSO: Can I free the prisoners?
FATHER: Hmmm.
LOBSANG: You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
TENZIN GYATSO: I am him.
LOBSANG: Not until you are eighteen.
