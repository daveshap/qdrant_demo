WASHINGTON: Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift.
JOHN ADAMS: Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
WASHINGTON: Horatio! Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
HORATIO GATES: Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
WASHINGTON: The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill. With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
HORATIO GATES: Who's in command out there?
WASHINGTON: Who the hell knows? Everyone's giving orders. It's all very democratic.
HORATIO GATES: George, we've got to get you out there before we lose our whole army.
JOHN ADAMS: With your support, Horatio. As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
WASHINGTON: As does your ability, Horatio. We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
