DAE experience 'burnout' for several days after one very rough day?
After a day where I'm an absolute mess and have to push through some very tricky anxiety I'll end up feeling burned out for about 2 weeks afterwards. I struggle to eat and I wake up exhausted every morning and feel dizzy and in general have a much higher baseline of anxiety that usual.

Anyone else have this? Could it be something like Adrenal Fatigue?
