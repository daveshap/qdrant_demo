JEREMY: Susan and I are very old friends, James.
JAMES: Fuck off.
JEREMY: And you were obviously getting nowhere with her. I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
JAMES: My God. You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
JEREMY: It might have worked. Really. I would have been delighted for you if it had. But she wasn't interested. Not my fault.
JAMES: You're a piece of shit
JEREMY: I've known Susan for more than fifteen years. James, we're old allies.
GOLD: James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are. Congratulations, and I really mean it.
JAMES: Thank you.
GOLD: It's everything we wanted. A very good read. A terrific piece of work. So, here's to you and Suez.
JAMES: And to history.
