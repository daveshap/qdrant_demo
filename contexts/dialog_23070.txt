SIDNEY: No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
BILLY: The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
SIDNEY: I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
BILLY: See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
SIDNEY: I'm so sorry... please understand.
BILLY: Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
SIDNEY: You know that's not true.
BILLY: Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
SIDNEY: No...
BILLY: Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
SIDNEY: No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
BILLY: It's been a year since she died.
SIDNEY: Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
BILLY: When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
SIDNEY: Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
BILLY: You have to move on, Sid.
