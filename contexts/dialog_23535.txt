ALEX: I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
DAVID: Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
ALEX: You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
DAVID: Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
JULIET: I thought you stopped going.
ALEX: Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
ALEX: God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.
JULIET: Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
ALEX: For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
JULIET: For the flat.
ALEX: No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
JULIET: She hated you --
ALEX: Well, she had problems --
JULIET: -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
ALEX: -- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
JULIET: You must be Hugo.
HUGO: You must be Juliet.
JULIET: Would you like to come in?
HUGO: I'd be delighted.
HUGO: It's nice.
JULIET: Would you like to see the rest?
JULIET: What do you do?
HUGO: Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
JULIET: What's it about?
HUGO: A priest who dies.
JULIET: I see.
HUGO: Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
JULIET: No.
HUGO: Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
JULIET: Writing seems easy.
HUGO: It's a breeze.
JULIET: Do you think you could answer that?
HUGO: The telephone? It continues to ring.
JULIET: Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
JULIET: No.
HUGO: All right.
