iPhone 8 Plus (iOS 11.4) is frozen on emergency SOS screen Last evening I tried to add a system macroscript (Switch Control) recipe. After that my iPhone wasn't responding to any of touch moves. I managed to unlock it with Touch ID but I failed a couple of times and now it requires a password. I tried this:  Subtle click the volume UP button. Subtle click the volume DOWN button. Hold the startup button until you see apple logo.Instead of force restart I'm stuck in emergency SOS screen mode. Touch interface doesn't work, force restart is not possible now. What do I do?
