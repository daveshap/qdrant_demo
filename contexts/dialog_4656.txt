BOURNE: Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer. That's why I came here.
IRENA: Okay.
BOURNE: It's nice. Does this picture mean anything to you? Hmm?

IRENA: No, I do.
BOURNE: I would want to know. I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
IRENA: What?
