Is high-speed rail a worthy project for America to pursue?
Over the past several decades, a number of ideas for high-speed rail in the US have been floated, coalescing into [concrete projects over the previous few years](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2015/09/the-unbreakable-us-high-speed-rail-system/406927/). Proponents have pointed to successful examples of such program in [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen) and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV) as role models for what the US should strive for at a time when economic activity is becoming [increasingly concentrated within cities](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/3/11852934/the-weeds-economic-recovery-cities), where cars are becoming less common with the rise of other public transport projects. 

Critics have attacked the frequent [cost overruns](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-bullet-train-cost-final-20151025-story.html) of these projects, as well as pointing out that the US already has a good highway system and that regional air travel is already a solid alternative. Proponents counter that highways are slow, flights expensive and the long-run savings from high-speed rail significant, and that the economic benefits in particular can be [significant](https://www.hsr.ca.gov/docs/about/business_plans/BPlan_2014_Sec_7_CaHSR_Benefit_Cost_Analysis.pdf). 

**Are European and Japanese high speed rail systems good examples for a similar American system? Why or why not?**
