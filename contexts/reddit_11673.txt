I have no one to talk to
A while back I broke up with my girlfriend of two years because things were falling apart. It sucked, but I was happier than I’d been in a long time and I moved on. 

This girl that I had been best friends with since my freshman year of college and I have been hanging out a lot more since I’ve been single and I fell for her pretty hard. Well yesterday she told me she was worried we were getting to affectionate with each other and she didn’t want us to get carried away and ruin the friendship we have. 

That night we were hanging out together and she kissed me. I told her how I felt about her and that I wanted us to be together, but she said that since we were both about to graduate and she was still waiting to see where she was going to grad school that she couldn’t start something new. 

I understood and I didn’t want to lose her as a friend, but all day things have just been weird. I want to talk to her like we did before but now I feel like I can’t. I just feel alone.
