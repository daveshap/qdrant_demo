CRABBIN: Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
MARTINS: What about?
CRABBIN: On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
MARTINS: What's that?
CRABBIN: Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
