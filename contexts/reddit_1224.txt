I asked to change the tv at the doctors
I was sitting at the doctors waiting for my husband to finish when the 700 club came on the tv talking about how Jesus healed mental and physical disabilities. I thought about just going to the car, but i finally asked about changing the tv. Unfortunately they just gave me the remote and some older people had just sat down looking directly at the tv. I wanted to change it to CNN but was afraid of them labeling me as a young liberal listening to fake news. So i changed it to local news. So now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming I can be cured by allowing Jesus into my heart.

But I did it!! I'm really proud of myself.
