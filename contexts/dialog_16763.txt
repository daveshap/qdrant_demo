JIM KURRING: You just woke up. And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
MARCIE: I went out last night.
JIM KURRING: Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me. The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
MARCIE: It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
JIM KURRING: Yes I can, Marcie. And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
MARCIE: Mischief? What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
JIM KURRING: Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok? Mischief. Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
MARCIE: No.
JIM KURRING: You on any medication?
MARCIE: No.
JIM KURRING: Been drinkin' today?
MARCIE: It's ten o'clock in the morning --
JIM KURRING: --- What was that?
MARCIE: I didn't hear anything.
JIM KURRING: No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
MARCIE: I don't have to do a god damn thing.
MARCIE: WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
JIM KURRING: Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
