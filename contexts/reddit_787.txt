My friend has been excluding me. What should I do?
I don’t want to go into to much detail, but this person has been a pretty good friend for a while and I’ve known them for a long time. But the past couple months, I’ve felt excluded and I do t know what to do.
I’m really hurt, but this probably the first time they’ve done something like this. What do I do?
