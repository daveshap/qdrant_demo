PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Naturally I am, sir.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: He says they've only shot down three planes.
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Look, he's there, and you're here.
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved. Thirty acknowledged the recall. That makes four shot down.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back. We're still working this thing out.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Well, just common sense, sir. Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not Buck" Schmuck!"
