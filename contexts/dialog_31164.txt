GRANT: Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
RICHARDS: Well, yes sir. A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
GRANT: Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories. And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
RICHARDS: Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man. And he's no ordinary Marshal. He's quite sophisticated. Three college degrees. A master of disguise. Speaks French...
GRANT: French?
RICHARDS: Yes sir.
GRANT: French? Damn it, I want my own man on this case. Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
