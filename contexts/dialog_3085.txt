BRUCE: How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
ALFRED: A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
BRUCE: It'll never work.
ALFRED: I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
ALFRED: Scholarly research?
BRUCE: She has an excellent mind.
ALFRED: If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
BRUCE: I wonder if she'd go out with me.
ALFRED: Apology hastily retracted.
