SUSAN: What a night.
PARRISH: I'm having a helluva time.
SUSAN: You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
PARRISH: I'm sorry.
SUSAN: Are you relieved?
PARRISH: Yes, but --
SUSAN: But what?
PARRISH: I want you to know how much I love you. That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
SUSAN: Daddy --
PARRISH: No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something. I don't want you to ever worry about me. If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right. -- And I have no regrets.
SUSAN: I love you, Daddy --
PARRISH: That's why it's okay.
