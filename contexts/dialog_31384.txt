JAMES LEER: I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
GRADY: Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
JAMES LEER: You mean, with your wife leaving you and all? Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
GRADY: Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
