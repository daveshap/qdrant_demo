BURNHAM: Got her right where you want her, Junior.
JUNIOR: Shut up.
BURNHAM: When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
JUNIOR: Shut up and let me think.
BURNHAM: I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think. Oh, that's gonna help.
JUNIOR: Okay, fuckball, you think. What are we gonna do?
RAOUL: What if she called the cops?
BURNHAM: She didn't.
JUNIOR: She said she did.
BURNHAM: She lied. Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em. Besides, Junior cut the phones.
RAOUL: What the fuck is funny about this?
BURNHAM: God.
RAOUL: There is not one thing funny here.
BURNHAM: Who else but God could think this shit up? I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in. God, man, He just loves the irony.
JUNIOR: Yes. Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing. You fuck. Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
BURNHAM: Can't. Whole point. Can't get in the room.
RAOUL: So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
BURNHAM: Make her come out. And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful. She can't get out of this house. She can't even think she can get out of this house. We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes. And I don't want Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger. That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven. So we're gonna seal the place up. They wanna hole up in here? Fine, we'll help 'em. Make it impossible for them to leave. Once they come out of that room.
