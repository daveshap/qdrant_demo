My previous question on this was ignored... Ubuntu server, wordpress installation I need pointing to an accurate up to date method to install wordpress. I also need details on setting up apache for it.There is NO official help or support which is a joke.Is there anything else beyond the virtual host file and the /etc/hosts edit.How exactly should they be configured? my ip just leads me to the apache test page, how to i get it beyond that into the sub directory.
