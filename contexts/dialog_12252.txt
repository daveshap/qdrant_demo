HAROLD: Why are there no photographs in these frames?
MAUDE: I took them out.
HAROLD: Why?
MAUDE: They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
HAROLD: I'll never forget you, Maude. But I would like a photo of you.
