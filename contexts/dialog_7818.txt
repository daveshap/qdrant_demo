LLOYD: ... If I may quote the twentieth century poet - Joe Piscahpo: You look Marvelous...
JESSICA: LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
LLOYD: HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
HARRY: You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
LLOYD: Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
HARRY: Well, I'm listening now.
LLOYD: Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
