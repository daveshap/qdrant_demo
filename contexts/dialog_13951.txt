MILES: Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?""
MARYLIN: You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
MILES: Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
MARYLIN: Have you ever been married, Miles?
MILES: No.
MARYLIN: You don't believe in it.
MILES: As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
MARYLIN: You just haven't met the right person.
MILES: No. I haven't. Have you?
MARYLIN: All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
MILES: He wants a reconciliation.
MARYLIN: See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
MILES: Gotcha.
MARYLIN: What is it you're after, Miles?
MILES: Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
MARYLIN: Well, don't look at mine!
