Ladies would you go on a first date in the morning eating breakfast?
The idea came from a meme but could this be a good idea?
I look back on my previous dates and remember the anxiety of dressing to impress, I could imagine the pressure is worse on girls.
Going out for a movie, dinner or a coffee pretty much doing any of the usual dating things are so cliche especially in the evening.
But going for breakfast sounds more casual and more relaxed
