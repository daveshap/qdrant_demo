LOCKE: ...Are you insane?
MESSNER: ...Almost. What do you mean who Sparazza actually was...""
MESSNER: You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
LOCKE: It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
MESSNER: ...Yeah, fifty-three.
LOCKE: The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
MESSNER: ...holy shit... that's Heller... Isn't it?
LOCKE: Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
