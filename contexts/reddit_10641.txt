I just called the Suicide Prevention Hotline. And they told me to call back when it’s less busy because I wasn’t “suicidal” or critical enough 🙄
Talk about a shitty mental health awareness system. I tried to call them because I’m very overwhelmed due to COVID-19 and the ongoing civil unrest in the country. I’m 19, and I have never been this anxious before. I am not actively wanting to kill myself but I am having a hard time seeing the “light at the end of the tunnel.” You’d think the 1-800-273-8255 number would be a better resource, but all they did was shoo me away and tell me my problems weren’t critical enough. I feel like I have nobody to talk to. I’m so scared and helpless right now. I have no job. I am worried for my safety in the US. I don’t feel safe anywhere I go and I’m wondering if it might just be better if I take some pills and end it all. I’m not planning to do this but I can’t see any improvement in the world coming any time soon. I just need help— but apparently the hotline is too busy to help me.
