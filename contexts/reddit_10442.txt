My father is tired of me “hurting” my mother. He is offering to find me an apartment so I can live alone and away from her. I will use this opportunity to kill myself.
As I mentioned in previous posts, my mother is emotionally and physically abusive to me. She has the gal to blame me for enraging her to do these things. My father is getting tired of her constant tantrums, and is offering to give me an apartment he will pay for so she can be free of me.

I will use this to my advantage to finally end my own life. Once I am alone in my apartment, with no one to stop me or witness me, I will overdose on all my medication pills at the same time. Then, I will die and finally know peace. Maybe then my parents will know peace too.
