What insights can be derived from the SD of these data? I'm a non-Math major. I need help interpreting my students' scores.The following are the post-test scores of two groups. Group A:26323130362928293630362936383431; Group B: 332937273428363932403836504032I computed the mean and standard deviations of the scores and got the following. For Group A: Mean = 31.94; SD = 3.59; for Group B: Mean = 35.44; SD = 5.63. The mean and SD of the two groups' pre-test scores were: Group A: Mean = 17.06, SD =6.29; Group B: Mean = 18.19, SD = 6.39.I noticed that the mean scores of both groups increased in the post-test while their SD decreased. However, although Group B has a higher mean post-test score, the SD score of Group B is higher than Group A's. What insights can be derived from this? How should I discuss when I present the data?
