What does an exit interview usually entail?

I quit my job a few days ago when a better offer came along. I told my boss about the offer the week before, he tried to counter it, but in the end he wasn’t able to give me the title change and increase in responsibility that I desired. I wrote a letter of notice to him that explained this and gave it to him in person with a verbal explanation also. 

Part of the reason I am quitting is because of my boss. I’ve been unhappy at my job for at least the past year. I was also just bored and wanted to learn more. I had no idea my boss or coworkers even thought I was an asset until I tried to quit and they said that I was the best person they have ever had in that position and didn’t want to lose me. I have been paranoid about being fired the past 2.5 years I’ve been there. My boss seems to only point out what I do wrong and rarely compliments me even when I am working my tail off. He promised me a lot of things that he never followed through with. He said no to most of my ideas and then was upset when I didn’t bring new things to the company. I mainly avoided him because his main form of communication was yelling. Everyone else at the company feels this way about him. That their biggest problem with the company is him. 

I just want to prepare for this exit interview. What do they typically entail? Should I be honest about how his bad communication skills is part of the reason I’m leaving? He is about to retire in a couple of years, so is there even a reason to do this? Everyone knows him in my industry and I want him to remember me positively.

I’m based in the US.

Update: I asked what the exit interview entails and he says that we will just be getting lunch together and discussing gnu reason for leaving the company. No HR involved. Strange, especially because our HR was present when I had to let go of another employee.
