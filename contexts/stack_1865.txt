What's the term for business conducted over time, as opposed to in one meeting? I'm looking for a word or term that describes conversation and development that's conducted over the course of several meetings and asynchronous communications, in contrast to work that's done all at once.For example, after spending nearly a full hour going back and forth, a member thinking they'd like to suggest the formation of a committee that would meet once a week for the next two months and/or a mailing list or call-for-papers might say, <blockquote>  \"May I suggest that we consider this question ______________,  instead of right now?\"</blockquote>Phrases that are in the neighborhood of the one I'm pretty sure I'm thinking of, but not quite right:over timein processionin deliberationin assemblyin absentiapost factode novoat lengthat largeat leisureasynchronouslyFor some reason, the word \"roll\" comes to mind when I think about this, some imagery of a thing rolling along in the process of deciding the question.
