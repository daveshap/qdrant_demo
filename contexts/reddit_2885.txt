5 months in new job, still incompetent - should I quit?
It's been 5 months since I started my new job in a new field (2nd job after uni, 1st job was a diff field). And I feel as lost as when I just started. I feel like i'm drowning every day I come in to work. At times, I just feel like ending it all.

I write for social media, and don't feel like I have the skills for it, or that i'm getting better at it. I want to perform, but because of my lack of skill, as much as I want to I can't. And I feel really bad for it - I don't like disappointing people. I've stayed up nights trying to catch up on work but it doesnt feel like its enough. There seems to be a huge writer/creative block that I cant get over - I cant seem to write or think fast enough.

Honestly I feel like that incompetent fool in the office. And I think my colleagues think that way too, although they've never said anything about it, and they have been really nice so far. 
I've seen them rant about other colleagues before to each other, and sometimes I can see that I frustrate some of them with my lack of ability to apply their advice.

My dad tells me that it takes time to learn the skills, and to stick it out - i'll get better with time. That i'm being too much of a perfectionist, and that i'm thinking too much. Colleague (a friend) who introduced me to job also says that I should stay and not give up so early. But is that the case for a skill based job like writing? I've been struggling since the start... and it doesn't seem to be getting better.

Also, I don't know what other career paths I can explore. I feel like I lack so much intellectually, with no skills (not even leadership or social skills), and where can I fit in like that?  I feel so stuck and lost, I just don't know what to do. What should I do?
