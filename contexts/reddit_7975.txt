If you are a poor grad student, you can file your taxes for free with TurboTax
If you are a poor graduate student like me and you make less than $36,000 per year, you can likely use TurboTax to file your taxes for free. This information is not widely known due to lobbying by the software companies. Until this year, I paid \~$110 to file my taxes every year of graduate school. That is money I never should have lost. 

Here is the direct link to TurboTax's free filing website. You need to access TurboTax through this website, or you won't be given the option to file for free: [https://freefile.intuit.com/](https://freefile.intuit.com/)

If you already have a TurboTax account, your account info will carry over. You won't need to re-enter your information.

I only found out about this free filing option through a podcast. Here's the article: [https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-just-tricked-you-into-paying-to-file-your-taxes](https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-just-tricked-you-into-paying-to-file-your-taxes)

EDIT: This post applies to folks in the USA. You can learn more about Free File here: [https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free). I think other software companies offer free filing options, but I've only used TurboTax.
