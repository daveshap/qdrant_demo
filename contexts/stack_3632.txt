Updating computers over unsafe connections If an attacker manages to get control of one of the devices managing or routing internet traffic along or on my network, e.g, a compromised router or femtocell/IMSI-catcher for mobile internet, how do I go about safely and securely updating my computers (e.g, apt-get update apt-get upgrade)?I realize doing this over tor might be a good idea, but I need to install tor in the first place and so need to connect to the internet.
