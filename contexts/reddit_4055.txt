Finding it hard to date someone when I am 6ft2 female
I have found it hard to date anyone. Guys who are shorter love everything about me except my height. Some have even gone as far as saying that they would be embarrassed to be with me in public. That I’ve ticked all the boxes so if that’s the one thing that’s untucked it shouldn’t be an issue.. but it always ends up having something to do with it. 

Even then because I’m “supermodel height” guys see me as the one they want to have sex with and not who they want to date and build a life with. I just don’t understand it.
