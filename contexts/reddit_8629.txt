What evidence supports and opposes the contention that the Trump Foundation has been self dealing?
Reading [this article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/06/trump-foundation-lawsuit) about the topic, I found it to be very biased and a bit too based around opinion for me to give it much credit. 

How big of a deal are the accusations when Trump *claims* that the Trump Foundation [apparently has donated to charity more than what was donated to the foundation](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1007278788009480192?lang=en)

Does this mean that the self dealing was even specifically using donor money, despite it being illegal to use the foundation's name for uses that the allegations describe? That makes me wonder if that extra money was coming directly out of Trump's pocket, or Trump Foundation assets?
