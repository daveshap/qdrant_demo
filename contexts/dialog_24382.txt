BANDIT: -- How we doing?
CLEDUS: It's gonna be close. Real close.
KATE: -- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage. We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
BANDIT: And?
KATE: He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
KATE: My very words.
BANDIT: Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
KATE: They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
BANDIT: Bandit II?
CLEDUS: Talk to me.
BANDIT: We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
CLEDUS: Let's boogie.
