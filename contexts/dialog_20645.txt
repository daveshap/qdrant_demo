CHARLIE: Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
MR. KELCHER: Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
CHARLIE: Yes, sir. Trust is a twoâ€”way street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
