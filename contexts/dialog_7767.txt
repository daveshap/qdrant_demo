PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
MS. HELLER: Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
MS. HELLER: We start our own class?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
MS. HELLER: You said aloha" twice."
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Aloha means hello and goodbye.
MS. HELLER: Oh wow. Look at you.
