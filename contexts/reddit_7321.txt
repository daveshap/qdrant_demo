Training/Certificates to boost resume
Hello, I have a question that Google has failed to answer (maybe I'm just asking it wrong) and I was hoping someone here could help. 

I'm a recent psychology graduate and I want to get into grad school except all of the schools I want to apply to require so many hours (or years) of work experience and I'm struggling to get a job in the field. I was wondering if there were any training courses or certificates I could get to improve my resume and make me a more competitive candidate. When I say courses I mean short term like a day or two (I don't have the time or money to get another degree ATM). I already have CPR/First-aid but there are so many different courses out there and of the jobs I've been applying to no one seems to be looking for the same certification. Can anyone help with this? Thanks in advance.
