BRODY: There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
HOOPER: You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
BRODY: There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
HOOPER: A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
BRODY: A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
HOOPER: I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
BRODY: We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
VAUGHN: Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
HOOPER: I don't have it.
BRODY: He lost it on the way up.
VAUGHN: What kind of a shark did you say it was?
HOOPER: Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
VAUGHN: Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
BRODY: We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
VAUGHN: I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems...
HOOPER: I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
BRODY: That means closing the beaches.
