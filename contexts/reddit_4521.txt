Does anyone else 'self harm' with music?
Sorry for the title, I don't mean to trigger anyone with the terms I used, but I feel it kinda fits with my behaviour and the reasoning..

&#x200B;

I have a long list of artists I can't listen to because they make me irrationally emotional, but once a month or so, I'll crack out the sad tunes and basically, purposefully let the music kill me internally. It's like I want to be overwhelmed with sadness and this is the easiest way to do it without the obvious actual self harming techniques.

Its like.... once I've had the massive cry and release of emotion, I'm halfway back to being me again.

EDIT: Thanks so much for the replies everyone. Its really nice to know this is actually something that seems reasonably common! 

If anyone is interested some of the tracks I listen to for the tears:

Dermot Kennedy - Glory

Of Monsters and Men - I of the Storm

Jessie J - Who You Are

Becalmed (Sea of Thieves Shanty) lol
