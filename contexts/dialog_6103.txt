DANTE: Hey! Where are you going?!
VERONICA: Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
DANTE: No, but you sucked enough dick!
VERONICA: Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
DANTE: A few?
VERONICA: ...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead! But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
DANTE: Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
VERONICA: Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
DANTE: I feel sick.
VERONICA: I love you. Don't feel sick.
DANTE: Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
VERONICA: I'm going to school. Maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.
DANTE: Thirty-seven. I just can't...
VERONICA: Goodbye, Dante.
