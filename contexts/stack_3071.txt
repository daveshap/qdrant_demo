Why Einstein's unified field theory is believed not to work? In his later life, Albert Einstein was trying to extend his general theory of relativity to incorporate electromagnetism and other fundamental forces with it, something he himself called \"The theory of everything\" or \"Unified field theory\". My question is, has Einstein published anything about this work, and if so, are they proved wrong?
