KEITH: No.
LENNY: A virgin brain! Well we're going to start you off right. So what do you know about this? Save us some time...
KEITH: Just what I've read. That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire. And now it's gone black market. So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
LENNY: I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
KEITH: Clips.
LENNY: That's right. Clips. Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here. This isn't like TV only better. This is life. It's a piece of somebody's life. Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex. You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
KEITH: What kind of things exactly?
LENNY: Exactly anything. Whatever you want. Whoever you want to be. Fabri, get us another round, would you.
