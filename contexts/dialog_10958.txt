PROXIMO: General, do you realize what happened out there today?
NARCISSUS: I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
PROXIMO: That's one way to look at it.
COS: You won an impossible fight. You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
PROXIMO: This is Cos, this precocious young man. A scribe for the Daily Action. I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
COS: I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate. So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet. And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
