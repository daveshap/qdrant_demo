MALCOLM: I got an award once. From the Mayor.
COLE: Congratulations.
MALCOLM: Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while. You're my very first client back.
COLE: You use needles?
MALCOLM: No.
COLE: Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
MALCOLM: No.
COLE: That's good.
COLE: I'm going to see you again, right?
MALCOLM: If it's okay with you?
