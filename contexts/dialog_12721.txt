KAHN: I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich."
TAUPIN: Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
KAHN: But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on. And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
TAUPIN: Offered the Pope one of his whores.
TAUPIN: Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.

TAUPIN: He found us even there.
KAHN: He always did.
