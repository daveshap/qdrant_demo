How much credibility do employee reviews have on websites like Glassdoor or Indeed?
Looking for a new job and as part of my due diligence I’ve been reading up on the employee reviews of the companies I’m applying to and they seem pretty polarizing for the most part. So which one should I trust? Any tips or advice on how to gauge the employment experience at a company?
