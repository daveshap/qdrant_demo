I met a woman whose 6’ tall and isn’t afraid of dating someone shorter than her
So I’m 5’6” and normally get told I’m too short whenever I start talking to a woman taller than me. Well I started talking to this woman I met on Hinge and we’ve already got pet names for each other, she calls me Nugget because I’m smaller than her. 

I met her and we’ve just clicked. Conversation is so easy, and she’s as big of a dork than me. We’ve already had discussions about things we want to do and trips we want to take together. 

She’s just awesome and I can’t wait.
