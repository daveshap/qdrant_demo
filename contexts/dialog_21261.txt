JENNIFER: Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.

DAVID: ... Yeah.
JENNIFER: Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
DAVID: That's great.
JENNIFER: So what is it?
DAVID: Well ... I just ... Can I ask you a question?
JENNIFER: Sure.
DAVID: Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
JENNIFER: Yeah ...
DAVID: Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
JENNIFER: No. She really liked you.
DAVID: You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
JENNIFER: Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
DAVID: Wow.
JENNIFER: Can I ask you a question?
DAVID: Yes.
JENNIFER: How come I'm still in black and white?
DAVID: What?
JENNIFER: Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
DAVID: Oh, I don't know. Maybe ... ... it's not just the sex ...
JENNIFER: What?
