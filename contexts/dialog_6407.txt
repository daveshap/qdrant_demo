ELLIE: ... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
PETER: It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely. Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which: How're you getting on with the old man?
ELLIE: He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
PETER: That's what they all say.
ELLIE: Ellie. Arroway.
PETER: Peter Valerian.
ELLIE: Sounds like a Russian general.
PETER: Yavol.
