JENNIFER: Ow! Shit!
THOMAS: Be quiet! Listen!
JENNIFER: No one's coming.
THOMAS: That big asshole nailed my windows.
JENNIFER: Mine, too.
THOMAS: We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs. Then we can run for it.
JENNIFER: No! I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
THOMAS: We can't carry him.
JENNIFER: You go, Thomas. You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
THOMAS: I'm not gonna leave you!
JENNIFER: Go! If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
