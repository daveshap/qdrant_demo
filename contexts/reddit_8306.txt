With the failure to pass the American Health Care Act, what direct control does the President exert over Obamacare's success or failure?
Shortly after inauguration, President Trump pulled back HealthCare.gov ads, an act that's [now under review by the Inspector General](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/24/inspector-general-to-review-pullback-healthcare-gov-ads.html), reviewing in part what effect that had on enrollment.  Since President Trump went on record saying the ["best thing we can do, politically speaking, is let ObamaCare explode."](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/24/trump-blames-democrats-for-gop-health-care-bill-failure-says-obamacare-is-imploding.html) I would like to know what specific control he exerts over Obamacare's success or failure.

**The Question: What impact can President Trump or his appointees exert over Obamacare that directly impacts it's success or failure?**

* Are they able to make the law fail?
* What regulatory impacts can they have on the law?
* What is untouchable or has to remain, contrasted with things like advertising that they apparently can shut down?  Can they modify subsidies, etc.

Appreciate any insight!
