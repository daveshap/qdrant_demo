FINDLEY: You gentlemen care for a drink?
EDDIE: No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
FINDLEY: By all means.
EDDIE: I thought we came here to play pool.
FINDLEY: I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
BERT: Well, we won't.
EDDIE: C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
BERT: How much?
FINDLEY: Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
BERT: You ever played billiards before?
EDDIE: Sure.
BERT: You hustlin' me?
FINDLEY: I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
BERT: Deal the cards.
FINDLEY: Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
EDDIE: Oh no, nothing for me.
EDDIE: How do we stand?
BERT: 'Bout even.
EDDIE: When do I raise the bet?
BERT: I don't know.
EDDIE: Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
BERT: Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
EDDIE: What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
FINDLEY: Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
EDDIE: Okay?
BERT: How much?
FINDLEY: Oh, about five hundred.
BERT: Do you really think you can beat him?
FINDLEY: Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
BERT: I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
EDDIE: I can beat him.
BERT: All right. Five hundred.
FINDLEY: Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
BERT: It's possible.
