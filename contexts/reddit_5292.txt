Am I within my rights to leave a shift at the exact finishing time? Please read scenario in description
If this should be asked somewhere else, please direct me, also not sure if the flair is correct.

I work in the UK, if that's of any importance.

I have a job that involves me working a split shift, one at 5am-8:30am, there are different managers for each shift, this is the only one I have a problem with.

I had a small argument/talk with my manager about this the other day, in basic form it went as follows:

Manager - "Please can you do jobs x,y,z"

Me - "I won't get all of that done in five minutes" 

Manager - "What's in 5 minutes?"

Me - "It's half 8 (supposed finishing time) in 5 minutes, I'm going home then."

Manager - "We won't be finishing at half 8, we have a responsibility to ensure everything is done, we started later today as well."

Me - "Okay, the time is fine, I'll give you another half an hour of my time. However, I was told that my hours would be 5-8:30am and I believe it says this within my contract, overtime is not compulsory also, so I do not have to stay after that time."

Manager - "I can't tell if you're being cheeky or not."

Am I within my rights to leave at 8:30 in a normal scenario, or in this one am I also allowed to leave at 8:30 or should it be 9?
