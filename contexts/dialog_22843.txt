JIMMY: What's this?
DANNY: Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare. It's for you.
JIMMY: But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
DANNY: You aren't coming with me.
JIMMY: Okay
DANNY: Wait till I tell you what it is.
JIMMY: It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
DANNY: Why?
JIMMY: You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
DANNY: Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
JIMMY: Hey, check it out...
DANNY: What the hell is that?
JIMMY: It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
JIMMY: What?
DANNY: I'm not a tweaker. I don't use drugs. I never had.
JIMMY: But...I've seen you.
DANNY: When? When did you ever see me use?
JIMMY: This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
DANNY: You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
JIMMY: No one ever noticed?
DANNY: Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
JIMMY: But... why? Why would you pretend?
DANNY: I can't tell you.
JIMMY: You don't trust me?
DANNY: I don't trust anybody.
JIMMY: And you want me to do you some big favor?
JIMMY: Wait If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
DANNY: Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers. I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
