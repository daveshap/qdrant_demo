PSA: Don't joke around in your common app
My clown of a friend put "certified cousin fucker" in her application as an award/EC (one of those) awhile back as a joke but she just realized that she didn't actually delete it. She got rejected from all of her common app schools and accepted to only the UC's, where she did not put that shit in her app. Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not. But don't fuck around and act like a clown.
