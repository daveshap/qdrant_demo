VAUGHN: Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns!
HOOPER: That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
BRODY: Wait a minute! I need you.
HOOPER: Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct. I know sharks.
VAUGHN: You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
BRODY: Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
VAUGHN: August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
