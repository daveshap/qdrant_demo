LESTER: Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
LOTTE: Why not? I need to get in there!
LESTER: I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
LOTTE: That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
LESTER: I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
