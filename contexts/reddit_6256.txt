Tips on negotiation salary and benefits
So next week I have a very promising meeting with a potential employer. I am very aware that no contracts have been signed yet, however after a very positive phone-call with the manager of the department, I am quite positive that the company really wants to hire me. This puts me - for the first time ever - in a position where I have some room to negotiate terms. What are some tips you guys have? It's a webdevelopment job. I am currently unemployed, so I do need a job soon, but I also do not want to over-bid in fear of them saying "Oh.. well that's way too much, we can't accept that, never mind then". Am I overthinking this? Any general tips on negotiation salary and benefits would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance!
