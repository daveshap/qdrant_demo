SAM: Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
GEORGE: Absolutely. Have him put it on a separate line. At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
ROBIN: I could die.
GEORGE: So could I.
ROBIN: Are you going to kiss me?
GEORGE: It's not my back that's killing me.
