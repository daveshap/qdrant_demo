KIRSTY: How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
TREVOR: In a word? Lucrative.
KIRSTY: The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
TREVOR: Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
KIRSTY: You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
TREVOR: What?
KIRSTY: Never to put you in my will.
TREVOR: Really? Why?
TREVOR: But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
KIRSTY: There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan
KIRSTY: And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
TREVOR: Really, why's that?
KIRSTY: I only married you for your body.
