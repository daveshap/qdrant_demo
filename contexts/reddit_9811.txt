Trying to re-enter Student Affairs job market
I've been out of student affairs for the past 6 years, and while I've lightly kept up to date on news, events, and trends, I feel like I'm kind of clueless of where to look for jobs (either it's changed where jobs are being posted online, or maybe there aren't as many job openings going on this year). I've been looking on Chronicle's job search website (Vitae) and Inside Higher Ed. I'm also aware of TPE, but I'm not looking for a ResLife position because I have a family and no ResLife experience, so I'm pretty much writing TPE off. Besides those websites and looking directly at universities job postings is there somewhere else I should be looking?
