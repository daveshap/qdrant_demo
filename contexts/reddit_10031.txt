Best way to figure out what Grad school to go to?
Hey everyone! I'm a Junior that attends Arkansas Tech University and I'm very interested in going into student affairs. Now to tell ya'll a little about myself. I have been a Resident Assistant since the spring semester of my freshmen year and also been apart of a fraternity since then as well. I have held an executive position in my fraternity and on the IFC. My question to you is how I should go about searching for a grad school in the next year? When should I start? Should I take the GRE since I don't have an impressive GPA? How did you figure out what you wanted to do in student affairs? (I'm torn between reslife and greeklife) Any helpful hints or tricks would be wonderful!
