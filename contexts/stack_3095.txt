Change of frame in a uniform magnetic field using relativity Let's say a charged particle is at rest in a uniform magnetic field. Now if we change our frame of reference the particle appears moving. Now according to classical physics the particle should move in a circle in this frame ( this can't be true because we know that the particle must move in a straight line in this frame.) Thus we conclude that the electromagnetic field changes.Can you use relativity to find the field in the moving frame so that physics becomes self consistent.<br>Note: If a source is strictly necessary to find the change in the field consider the source as an infinitely long sheet carrying a uniform areal current along it's area. It should be easy to see using ampere's circutal law that the field is uniform and can be calculated easily.
