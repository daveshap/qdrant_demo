Cannot add folder to boot drive My boot drive is a 1TB drive and is working fine. Another 1TB drive is acting a bit flaky so I want to move some data (200GB) from my flaky drive to a folder on my boot drive (900GB free on my boot drive).Using the Unity DE, I click on \"Computer\" on the left and I see lots of folders but I am unable to create a new folder here. I tried the File menu but New Folder is disabled.I can create folders under my profile but this is data I would prefer not be under my profile.Is there a way to add folders on the boot drive without those folders being under my home directory? If there is not, must I re-partition my boot drive to be able to use all of the empty space?
