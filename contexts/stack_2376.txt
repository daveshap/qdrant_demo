Why do I burp sometimes? Sometimes I burp after eating food in Minecraft (Java edition 1.13.2 on Linux in a singleplayer world). First, the food will be consumed as normal, restoring the expected amount of hunger. Then I hear a \"burp\" sound and additional hunger is restored. Since this usually happens unexpectedly, I don't know whether additional food has been consumed or not. What causes the burp? What are its effects? And can it be done intentionally?
