KAY: Something seem unusual to you about that?
JAY: Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates? Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.

JAY: I dunno. Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
KAY: Let's check am out.
ZED: Kay? What's your 20?

KAY: What the hell is going on?
