Is anyone a recruiter here? Wondering how much I’ll get directly after my temp-to-hire stage through a third-party recruiter.
Exactly like the title says. I’m currently a temp (through a third-party recruiter) and I’m getting paid XX.XX amount/ hour. I was wondering how much I would be getting when I get hired directly. My coworker told me when he was a temp he got paid less than what he received with his FTE offer (per hour).

Are there any recruiters here that can possibly go in their systems or something and check how much the full amount is and what commission recruiters get? Or how does it work? I can PM what company it is.  

I know this opportunity wasn’t JUST through specific recruiters as I’ve met many interviewees from various recruiting companies.
