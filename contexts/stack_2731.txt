If the moon also fall then why can the astronaut moonwalks? imagine astronauts inside the ISS while everything are in free fall, the astronauts are floating around. Now if the moon are also in free fall then how come astronauts can perform moonwalk on the surface but not on ISS?btw ISS stands for international space station.
