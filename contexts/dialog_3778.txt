DRAGONETTI: Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
FROST: You're wrong, Dragonetti.
FROST: The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
DRAGONETTI: Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
FROST: Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose?
DRAGONETTI: I see. And what would you have us do with this half-breed"?"
FROST: Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
DRAGONETTI: He is an abomination!
