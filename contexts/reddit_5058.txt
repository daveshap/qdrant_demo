College age son having trouble getting jobs at college. I need some advice on how to help him or on what he can do to improve his chances.
He applies for part time positions at local manufacturing plants, his major is Mech. Engineering. However all he receives are standard HR notices saying "You don't fit the positions we have." or similar.  I don't feel qualified to help so am looking for advice. He would probably let me post his resume if you want to see it.

Edit: Thank you for those who have taken time to offer suggestions. I'll be back because I'm working on my resume as well. :)
