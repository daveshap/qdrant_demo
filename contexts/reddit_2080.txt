For all y’all that need to improve your social skills before college
I’m seeing a lot of posts about losing out on high school experiences and stuff so here’s some pointers on how to get conversations going and make some friends in college.

1. Ask about their day/weekend. People usually can go on and on about their weekends. 

2. Talk about politics...maybe. There’s always something on the news about politics so you can just talk about that but don’t get too defensive and whatnot otherwise you’ll make enemies instead of friends.

3. Sports. Basketball and football are hot topics. I can talk on and on about basketball plus there are games like everyday so there’s always something to talk about.

4. Music. I found a lot of my friends through music. Just ask them what their favorite music is and see if you can can listen to songs together /recommend any songs.

5. Summer plans. Ik summer’s long off but people have already been planning it (trips, internships, jobs, etc)

6. Driving. A lot of people our age are driving now so just talk about scary experiences or like how to get a license.

7. Ask about a homework assignment. Even though you may know how to do it, sometimes just asking for the sake of conversation can help develop friendships.

8. This kinda relates to 2 but just talk about what’s on the news. Like the coronavirus, for example.

9. Just complain. About driving, about parents, about siblings, about a teacher, about homework, about a test, etc. People usually have A LOT to say if they’re complaining about something.

These are some basic tips! Please drop any other pointer in the comments!
