CABLE: She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
KLUTE: I believed her, Pete.
TRASK: He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
KLUTE: I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
CABLE: All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
KLUTE: It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
CABLE: Then, close the case.
KLUTE: I better keep looking.
CABLE: Where, how?
KLUTE: I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
CABLE: You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
KLUTE: It's got to make sense some way.
