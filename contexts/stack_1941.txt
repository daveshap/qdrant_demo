Term for this type of mis-pronunciation? When I was a kid, for years I thought<blockquote>  nihilism</blockquote>was pronounced \"nil-ism\".I guess this is because I only ever read it, rather than being exposed to hearing it.  Since \"nil-ism\" perfectly expresses the concept by coincidence, it stuck, until I embarrassingly learned I was pronouncing it wrong! (Making it hard to discuss Sartre, etc.){For anyone learning English reading this, it's just pronounced nye-ill-ism - it's a variation of \"annihilate\".}A similar thing, I once heard an adult (well-educated) say \"pseudo\" as \"puh-sway-do\" rather than sue-doh.(Again, I assume since the person had only read it and not heard it.)A similar word might be segue: I bet lots of people say \"seeg\".In fact, do linguists (or .. someone?) have a technical term for this?  What's the deal?Mispronunciation due to, I suppose in short having never heard the word in use but rather just reading it.So, if you have a wonderful liberal education with professors saying \"nihilist\" and \"pseudo\" all the time, this wouldn't happen - it's kind of a, let's say, \"self-taught pronunciation misunderstanding!\"Term?
