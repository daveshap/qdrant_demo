It's Official! I Made it Through Black Friday Without Spending A Dime!
Yes it's true. Despite all the retailers using every trick in the book to try to separate me from my hard earned money, I held strong. Yes, we will do some shopping for the holidays but not this madness that is a retail frenzy for me. My hope is others we as successful in managing and controlling their dollars and credit cards. Good Luck going forward and Happy Holidays to All!

Edit: Wow! I never expected this great response. Now I will admit, we went to our local Walmart grocery store on Sunday to get some cleaning supplies and food for the house, it wasn't what I consider part of the Black Friday retail weekend experience. I was even telling my wife to stay away from the meat department because we had plenty of ham/turkey from Thanksgiving day. We will be eating ham/turkey sandwiches until it is time to throw it all out....we will freeze some for some lazy weekdays when we don't want to cook. I hope everyone had a great holiday and keep up working on your plan to get to a better financial place. You don't have to be a Scrooge, but work YOUR plan.

Edit 2: Wow! Silver and Gold for not spending dollars or using credit in the retail spending frenzy. But that is kind of what this sub is about. Make a budget, put some aside for savings/emergencies and you will find a reward for all the hard work. I'm not living on the edge any more but I'm still close enough that I can see the edge. So hang in there everyone. Keep working your plan...I may be one terrible life disaster away from being back in the hole, but it does get better. Thanks to everyone.
