JACK: Give in to despair and all is lost.
GUMP: It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
JACK: There's more than one way to spring a trap.
GUMP: Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
JIMMY: Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
JACK: You've been inside?
JIMMY: In a dream.
JACK: Don't speak to me of dreams! I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
GUMP: That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
JACK: On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
GUMP: Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
