LONGFELLOW: Why not? Who is he?
CEDAR: A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate. Tell him to see me at my office.
LONGFELLOW: Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him. Send him in.
CEDAR: He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW: How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
