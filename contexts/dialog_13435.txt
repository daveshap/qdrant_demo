BETSY: I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
HOLLAND: I have no defense. So far as I know -- it is true.
BETSY: You can't believe that. You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad. You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
HOLLAND: How do you know I'm not? I was cruel to Jessica. When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
BETSY: I can understand that. Everyone feels that way about someone.
HOLLAND: No. It's not just how I felt toward Jessica. I've been cruel to even you.
BETSY: You wanted to warn me...
HOLLAND: The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
BETSY: Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
HOLLAND: I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
BETSY: That's past -- that's over and done with...
HOLLAND: I want you to be safe, Betsy. I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
BETSY: You want that?
HOLLAND: Yes.
