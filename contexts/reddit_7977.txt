Does anyone know anything about GA jobs and unemployment?
Long story short: I graduated with my masters Saturday. Friday was my last day of employment as a GA on campus. I didn’t work any other jobs while in school for two years. My hours had been majorly reduced when the pandemic hit, but now I’m officially unemployed. 

I revived a grant that requires me to work for my state in child welfare for two years to “pay off” my schooling. Well, clearly hiring is on the back burner right now. So that leaves me waiting and waiting to hear back with no other job. 

I applied for unemployment, but I’m getting a sense that most states won’t accept my GA gig as work. Does anyone know much about this? I applied for a $500 one-time CARES grant with my school, but I’m afraid that’s all the assistance I’ll get.
