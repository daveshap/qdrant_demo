ALICE: Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
MISS CALLAHAN: What do you mean?
ALICE: I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
OLIVER: She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
MISS CALLAHAN: But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
OLIVER: But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
MISS CALLAHAN: She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
