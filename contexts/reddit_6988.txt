Current job has technical problems where I can’t work. No sign of when it is going to be fixed
I have an interview in a couple of hours. It’s nothing fancy. But given my current situation I’m thinking to tell them my availability is open for now. 

My current job is just call center stuff(also not fancy) 
Should I tell them that my availability may change and what it may change to? 

Amy feedback welcome. 

Also my current job has had issues since Saturday. I’m off on weekends. I was there for 4 hours yesterday and sent home today.
