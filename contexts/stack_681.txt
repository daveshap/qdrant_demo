Signal out of range message at boot time I have gone through all the posts and I am pretty sure I know how to fix it, but I can't seem to be able to get to a prompt.I see GRUB loading and then nothing from that point forward. Immediately after post I see a flashing cursor in the upper left corner. A few seconds later the monitor displays a message saying signal out of range.  No keystrokes at any point give me access to a login prompt. I'm not sure what to do at this point.I installed 16.04 and 17.10 with the same result.
