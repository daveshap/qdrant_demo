MUELLER: We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
PIKE: Where's your shirt, Mueller?
MUELLER: I used it to start the fire --
PIKE: Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
MUELLER: I was freezing from the hurricane --
KENDALL: So you took off your shirt?
MUELLER: To start a fire, goddammit! What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
PIKE: Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
MUELLER: We're not going anywhere.
PIKE: Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
MUELLER: The fuck are you talking about --
PIKE: You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
MUELLER: Bullshit --
PIKE: Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
MUELLER: Shut up!
