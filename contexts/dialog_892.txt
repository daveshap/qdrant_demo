SYKES: So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
JETSON: My wife? She worries about me.
SYKES: Yeah... I know the routine.
JETSON: You are married?
SYKES: Was. Divorced.
JETSON: We mate for life. Divorce... is a strange concept to us.

JETSON: Your home is quite disordered. I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
SYKES: I appreciate your honesty, George.
