You have more to offer than just your physical appearance.
Just a little reminder to those who are online dating (or dating in general). The right people well accept you for all of you and the wrong people aren’t meant to be in your life. 

Edit: 

To clarify, I didn’t mean that physical appearance does not matter at all. I’m just saying that there is more to offer than just looks. 

It’s important to maximize your attractiveness: workout, eat healthy, groom yourself, dress nicely, take care of yourself in general so that it increases the chances of getting a date. When you look good, you feel good and people will feel that energy about you. You must ultimately love yourself first and not expect people to love you if you cannot love yourself. You cannot pour from an empty cup. 

I do agree that men have a harder time dating than woman. For the simple fact that woman are generally more desired than men etc and I can’t relate because I am not a male. 

I was just making a point to remind people that you have more to offer the world and the opposite sex than just your physical appearance, but this post turned into a good discussion and I appreciate everyone’s input and comments. :) 

Loneliness and rejection hurt but it’s important to remind yourself of the good qualities you possess too or dating will hurt your self-esteem and will ultimately make you have a harder time out there in the dating world. Remember that rejection isn’t always about you and try not to identify with it too much. Good luck everyone.
