NATIONAL EDITOR: --this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
ROSENFELD: Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
NATIONAL EDITOR: --well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
ROSENFELD: --absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--

BRADLEE: Then it's our asses, isn't it?
SIMONS: And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
