Keeping your living space clean
Does anyone else struggle greatly with keeping your apartment/house clean, especially in a low mental place? When I’m more depressed my dishes build up, I run out of laundry and everything goes to shit. I feel better and I’ll clean one room, but then it takes over again  and I can never seem to keep up. If I leave my clothes laying around my cats pee on them and now I’m left with like four bags of clothing covered in cat pee and I don’t know where to begin and what to do with it. I’m so overwhelmed, any time I do clean I avoid dealing with the cat pee clothes. It’s so disgusting and I just keep ignoring it :/
