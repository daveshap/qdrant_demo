Who else is in their mid-late 20's and has hardly experienced life and never "go out"?
It's really bothering me that I let my mental health own me so much. I am 26 and don't do anything fun. It's no wonder I am depressed. I never go to bars or clubs or have a group of friends to hangout with. I don't have any hobbies that'd help me meet people. I am doing nothing right towards socializing. I work and hang at home with my family. That's all i do. 

Who else is missing out on life and meeting people?
