I have to make a decision between two schools one is my perfect school (I'd have to take some loans ($12k)) or go to my local public university and graduate debt free. Can you give me some advice on which route to go?
I plan on majoring in finance and breaking into investment banking after University. 

So I got accepted into Trinity University and the University of Houston. Trinity University costs $52k a year tuition, room, board, and fees. However I was awarded enough to make it cost $19k a year, but part of of my award money is a $12k scholarship. UH tuition and fees and food and activities is about $13.5k a year and I'd be staying at home and commuting to campus. 

I like everything there is at Trinity, if I go there I will be recruited by the swim team, and get to continue swimming which I absolutely love. I also love the small class sizes and small campus at Trinity, and the fact that I would be able to get away from home. 

In both cases my parents will cover tuition costs up to about $15k, but that is all they can afford. So I'll have to work a summer job to get some extra money for trinity, which I'm fine doing. I'll also have to graduate with some student loans.

My plan to pay off my student loans is to work in Houston after graduation and live with my parents till I pay off all my loans. 

Is Trinity University worth taking out a loan for?
