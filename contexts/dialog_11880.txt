DARLENE: Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks. Hello?
RICHARD: Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
DARLENE: Hang on Mrs. Pierce. Not that tie, on the other side. That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
RACHEL: Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
RICHARD: Found it.
DARLENE: Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope she feels better. Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
RICHARD: Why not?
DARLENE: Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink Rachel?
RACHEL: Mom, please
DARLENE: You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
RACHEL: Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
DARLENE: Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
RACHEL: Can't you find somebody else?
DARLENE: Its too late.
RACHEL: What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
DARLENE: Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
RACHEL: Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment. But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
JAMIE: I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
