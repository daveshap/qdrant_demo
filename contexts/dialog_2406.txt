DEBBIE: God, you're a slob.
RICK: But a fabulous cook.
DEBBIE: What are we having?
RICK: It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
DEBBIE: I think your dinner's burning.
RICK: Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
DEBBIE: Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
RICK: Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
DEBBIE: You're going to have a bachelor party?
RICK: Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event. Well, what do you think?
DEBBIE: It looks awful.
RICK: Yes, but looks are deceiving... Not in this case, however.
DEBBIE: Are you going to have women at your party?
RICK: No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
DEBBIE: I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
RICK: Oh, those. Why do you ask?
DEBBIE: Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
