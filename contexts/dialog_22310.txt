DOLORES: He's a riot.
VALIANT: Oh, yeah? Well, you're not handcuffed to him. Anybody in the back room?
DOLORES: It's all yours.
DOLORES: So you decided to help him after all?
VALIANT: I oughta have my head examined. Will you hold still?
ROGER RABBIT: Does this help?
VALIANT: Yeah, that's better.
VALIANT: You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
ROGER RABBIT: Well, no, not <u>any</u> time. Only when it was funny.
VALIANT: Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
ROGER RABBIT: My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
VALIANT: Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
DOLORES: Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
VALIANT: If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
