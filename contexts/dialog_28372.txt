HOOKER: Excuse me, sir. Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
MAN: What for? I haven't done anything.
HOOKER: We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station. Have you made any purchases here today?
MAN: Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
HOOKER: Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good. Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
MAN: But I got a train to make.
HOOKER: It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
MAN: But what about all these other people?
HOOKER: We'll get 'em! Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know. We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh? You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it? Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge. I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people. You try to help 'em and they spit on you. I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
MAN: I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.
HOOKER: All right, I'll give ya a break. Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left. Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this... ...in the back and run it through right away. We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
MAN: Thank you. You don't know how much I appreciate this.
HOOKER: Think nothin' of it.
