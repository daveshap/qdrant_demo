MAJOR HICKS: Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
NICK: It's Tatopoulos.
MAJOR HICKS: Right. The worm guy. Can someone get those people off the beach?
NICK: Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
MAJOR HICKS: Follow me.
NICK: You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
MAJOR HICKS: We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
NICK: Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
MAJOR HICKS: We know.
NICK: Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
MAJOR HICKS: Yeah, you're the worm guy.
NICK: The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
MAJOR HICKS: No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
NICK: It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
MAJOR HICKS: Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
NICK: They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
MAJOR HICKS: Then you're perfect. Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
NICK: What sample?
MAJOR HICKS: You're standing on it.
