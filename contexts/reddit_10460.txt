Humans :)
Humans are funny creatures. When you tell them "I am happy, I am good at this" they make fun of you and say "you're a loser you should go kill yourself".

When you tell them "I'm a loser. I'm gonna kill myself", they go ahead and tell you "noooo please don't, you deserve life and happiness like everyone".

Fuck you humanity. Fuuuuuck, you.

Edit: Ok my intention wasnt not spreading hate. I'm pointing out the irony of our nature as human beings. When I say humans I'm talking about people who live in modern society, and I'm included in that bunch.
