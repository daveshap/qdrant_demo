Cute girl sat next to me on the bus, contemplated asking her out - then I was so glad I didn't.
Seemed on purpose as well - chose the seat right next to me while most of the bus was empty. Pretty cute, bookish - my type, and of course I was too inactive to strike up a conversation. Kicked myself while she got off the bus a few stops later.

And walked straight into the Scientology building on the corner.

Just feeling a bit glad my incompetence saved me from a huge incompatibility... or perhaps a bit shit that I'm attracting all the crazies. Hope this isn't the only time this happens though.
