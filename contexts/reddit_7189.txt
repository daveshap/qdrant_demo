applying to ralphs (grocery store)
my local ralphs needs people during the corona virus and i can’t work anymore at my other job cause my hours have been cut cause only one person works at a time now and i’m low level- but i’m going to apply i think but i’m pretty anxious on how it’s gonna be, i have pretty bad social anxiety and i’m already getting anxious even tho i haven’t even applied yet lmao. but what’s the first day like, and when you’re actually working do you have someone telling you what to do or do you just figure out what to do??? like each shift do you have one specific task? i have no idea what to expect because my job now is pretty simple- i work with one other person and we just scoop icecream then close the shop. for some reason working at a grocery store terrifies me but i know i need to get over it so i can become stronger. one more question regarding how the day goes, since i’m only 17 will i be closing or opening or do you only go in for small shifts. i’m definitely overthinking it
