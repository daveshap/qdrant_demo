JOEL: I might be making a mistake.
VOICE-OVER: Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
JOEL: Fuck you, Clementine.
JOEL: Pink. There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718? I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
VOICE-OVER: The pill was pink, I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
