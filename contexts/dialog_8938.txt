SUSIE: You can always get another girl.
JACK: There's always another girl.
NICK: Sick? How sick?
FRANK: The flu.
NICK: So she's got a few sniffles.
FRANK: Doctor's orders.
NICK: You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
FRANK: Look, Nick. You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
NICK: What am I gonna do? Put a record player out there? Bad, Frankie. Bad.
JACK: What're you doing?
FRANK: Just until we find another girl.
JACK: Cancel, Frank.
FRANK: You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie? We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
JACK: Better give her pneumonia.
