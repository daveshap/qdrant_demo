KEITH: I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
CARTER: What?
KEITH: I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work. He was always on time.
CARTER: Did you work with him, Keith?
KEITH: At the Half Moon.
EDDIE: It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus... ...then he goes and does a thing like that. It's a bloody funny thing.
CARTER: Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
