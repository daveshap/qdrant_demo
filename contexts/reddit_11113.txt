Are you actually kidding me?
My school dedicated an entire two full pages (front and back) to Kobe. But not even a section of a page to one of my closest friends that died during freshman year. These people cared more for a celebrity than they did for a student that went to their school, paid for their events, and they personally knew.


It’s sickening

Edit: I thank everyone for the gifts, you’re very kind, but please, donate the money to a charity for youth mental health please. I don’t need them

Edit 2: to everyone asking, it wasn’t suicide
