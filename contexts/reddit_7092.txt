How to pay a young American employee?
Hello, I am opening a business in Louisiana, USA, and I need a "part-time" assistant who can take care of business from time to time. That means I dont need an employee with a fixed schedule, but maybe only work 3-5 hours each week. I can't travel all the way from Europe to LA every week, so I need that assistant. 

I am looking for a young employee, around my age, possibly in university. This is a startup company.
