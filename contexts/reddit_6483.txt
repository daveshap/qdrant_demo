Have you ever fallen in love with a job you thought you would hate?
I started a new job last week but I'm already wondering if it's the right place for me... I can pinpoint the little things that bother me, but none are worth quitting over. I will say it is different from the jobs I've had in the past, which might be why I feel a little off... 

Has anyone ever been in a similar position? Some people say by the end of the first week, you "know". Others say you need to give it at least 3-6 months. Any insight at all would be appreciated!
