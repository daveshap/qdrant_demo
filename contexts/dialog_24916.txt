BUZZ: So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
THEO: I never saw you.
BUZZ: Thanks, kid. Where are you goin' now?
THEO: I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
BUZZ: Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me. Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
BUZZ: I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
BUZZ: You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call. Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn. Don't say I never gave you nothing.
THEO: See ya 'round Maynard.
