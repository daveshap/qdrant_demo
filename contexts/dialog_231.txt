HAL: Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
BOWMAN: I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
HAL: Well, don't worry about it.
BOWMAN: And don't you worry about it.
HAL: Is your confidence in me fully restored?
BOWMAN: Yes, it is, Hal.
HAL: Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
