Leaving a Job You Love
I work with a Campus Activities Board. I absolutely love what I do. I truly enjoy working with students, especially in an event planning capacity.

I have been in my position for three years. While I love what I do, I unfortunately am not in a supportive environment. Everyone is in their silos. There are small cliques. We see a ton of turnover. It has a lot upper management micromanaging and stifling creativity. 

As I shared, there has been a lot of turnover. Many of my close colleagues have moved on to other opportunities. I have decided to start searching for my next position. The challenge is... I am having a hard time with the thought of parting ways with a job I love and an amazing group of students.

Who has been in a situation like this? What did you do? What advice do you have?
