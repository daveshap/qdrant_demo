KETCHAM: I think I've heard of you.
RATH: It's possible.
KETCHAM: You're pretty famous aren't you?
RATH: I hope not.
KETCHAM: I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
RATH: It's a common question.
KETCHAM: Oh yeah? I guess we still need to see that price tag. Like art, right? You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
RATH: A dime.
KETCHAM: One hundred thousand? That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
RATH: Average.
KETCHAM: Shit... oh well.
KETCHAM: I have been thinking about this for a long while. I knew this day was coming. I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked. What do you call it anyway?
RATH: Taken.
KETCHAM: 'Taken.' That's nice. When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
RATH: Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
KETCHAM: That's exactly what I told myself.
