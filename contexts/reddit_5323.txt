Bosses are funny
My first big boy job and i never thought I'd get a talking to for working late. I have one person above me I'm a junior software dev for a medium sized wfm company. I ended up emailing him  later in the evening than normal cause I found an issue and he got a little mad at me for being there so late. He said and I quote  "I appreciate your dedication, but you need to go home. We can work on the issues tomorrow. That's why they call it job security. You deserve your sleep." Never thought I'd get scolded for working more than normal. I am salary so I dont even get paid after 40 hours. Anyone else have situations like this?  Do I worry about it or just keep doing what I normally do?
