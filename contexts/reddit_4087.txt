The slow fade is 10x worse than ghosting
Both are obviously annoying and rude as hell but at least when you get ghosted you pretty much know that things are done after a few days of no contact. The slow fade leaves you on the hook for weeks or even months and you often don’t know for sure if they’re losing interest or are genuinely just busy. Asking about the diminished contact can make you feel clingy and insecure, and the only way to know what’s actually going on is to wait for them to eventually cut you off completely.

It sucks.
