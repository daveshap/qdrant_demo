ABBOTT: Sit down.
PAMELA: I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
ABBOTT: I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
PAMELA: 'Why' would be enough for me.
ABBOTT: I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
PAMELA: And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
ABBOTT: Why not? It was just money.
PAMELA: And Danny Zorn, what was that?
ABBOTT: Had to be done.
PAMELA: No good options left?
ABBOTT: In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
PAMELA: No. You lost your way.
ABBOTT: Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
