ELLIE: Some kind of circuitry...?
HADDEN: Very good, Doctor. I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
ELLIE: A machine. But a machine that does what?
HADDEN: That would seem to be the question of the hour. I want to build it, Doctor. Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
ELLIE: And in return?
HADDEN: In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game. Do we have a deal?
ELLIE: Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But. If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
HADDEN: That's my girl. Done.
ELLIE: ... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
PRESIDENT LASKER: A transport. So are they coming or are we going?
