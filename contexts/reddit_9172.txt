I paid for Christmas without putting anything on credit!
For the first time in my adult life I've paid for Christmas from actual money instead of borrowing it! This is a huge achievement for me and marks months/years of trying to trim the fat and stick to a budget while still having a life.

I did this mostly by:
-Resisting the urge to go big and just get small gifts for my family
-Picking things up throughout the year as I saw them, which both spreads the cost and allows me to take advantage of discounts that might not be available close to Christmas as retailers hike up prices
-Sticking to an actual budget!

Fortunately I don't have a partner or kids so my expenses weren't that high to begin with. But it still feels great to say Christmas is paid for and I haven't increased my deficit to do it.
