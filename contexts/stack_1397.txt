How does a TLC5917 LED Driver work? I have been messing around with TLC5917 LED Constant Current Sink Drivers and I don't fully understand how they work. Because of how I was taught how Voltage/Current works, to my understanding, a voltage of 5V should be able to be measured between an active pin on the driver and a 5V source going through an LED.What I measure however appears the be the forward voltage of the LED.It is my understanding that current is drawn and voltage is \"applied\".Since the driver is constant current, the behavior makes sense but how exactly does the driver supply the correct voltage?Or is my conceptual understanding of how voltage/current work misguided?
