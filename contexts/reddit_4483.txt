Does anyone else feel the urge to sabotage aspects of your life, so that people take you seriously?
I’ve contemplated taking up drinking, because I feel like people would understand me more if I did. The alcohol is something more tangible than my illusive feelings. I don’t drink or smoke, yet I struggle everyday. Why? What’s wrong with me? Why am I so weak and stupid?
