What precedent is there for a President levying punitive taxes on an individual company such as Harley Davidson?
According to Trump, Harley Davidson will be [taxed like never before](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/26/trump-says-harley-davidson-using-trade-tensions-as-an-excuse.html).  This isn't the first time Trump has threatened to tax a specific company, as he [threatened a 35% tax on Ford products made in Mexico](http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/15/news/economy/trump-tariff-ford-mexico/index.html) during the 2016 campaign.  Can or has a President ever punished a company with taxes because he was upset with their behaviour?

On what basis would this be legal?  What evidence is there that this is or is not a [bill of attainder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder)?  Or is that even a relevant question when targeting a foreign entity, which the overseas part of Harley Davidson could be considered?

Edit: a possible parallel I thought of is the 63% income tax rate which was levied [only on John Rockefeller jr.](http://ideas.time.com/2012/09/18/the-rich-havent-always-hated-taxes/) .
