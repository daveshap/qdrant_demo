I hate this
I hate when I tell people how I feel they say don't be sad.. Be happy.. U can't think that way... Be more positive.. And stuff like that.... Like it's that easy.. Like I choose to be like this.. It's not easy to stop those thoughts... I don't have switch in head... I wish didn't hate myself... I wish I could turn it off... I know low self esteem is not attractive.. But I didn't choose it..  When they ask why I don't trust people or talk to people it's because of that...
But if you have read this.. Know that I know how you feel.. I know it's hard to fight your own mind...
