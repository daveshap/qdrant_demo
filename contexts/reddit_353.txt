How to tell my brother to stop smoking weed in the house?
Last school year my brother went off to a college across the state. Among many reasons, he decided to transfer to a school near our house so he moved back in. It seems like he developed a habit (or maybe a more apparent one) of smoking weed when he was gone and has brought that habit into our house. He now sleeps in the basement and has it smell like skunk. I don’t know if my parents realize it or not, or they just don’t care, but I don’t want the house smelling like weed. I’m totally ok with him smoking weed, but I want him to do it outside or in the garage, not in the basement or the bathroom. How can I tell him that in a non confrontational way?
