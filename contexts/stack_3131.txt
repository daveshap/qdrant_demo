Why aren't particles constantly \"measured\" by the whole universe? Let's say we are doing the double slit experiment with electrons. We get an interference pattern, and if we put detectors at slits, then we get two piles pattern because we measure electrons' positions when going through slits. But an electron interacts with other particles in a lot of different ways, e.g. electric field, gravity. Seems like the whole universe is receiving information about the electron's position. Why is it not the case and the electron goes through slits \"unmeasured\"?Bonus question: in real experiments do we face the problem of not \"shielding\" particles from \"measurement\" good enough and thus getting a mix of both patterns on the screen?
