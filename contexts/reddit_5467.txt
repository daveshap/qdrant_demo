What do I qualify for in the IT industry?
Hello World!

So I'm in between jobs right now. I spent a year in a contract position with Apple maps. Some of the stuff I was exposed to include: editing, proofreading, and creating workflow processes, Quality Assurance, PostgreSQL, and some exposure to Tableau.

I have a unrelated undergraduate degree in Geology. On my spare time I have been learning python but I dont have any projects under my belt.

I do know I want to stay in the IT industry but as funny as this sounds, I dont know what I qualify for. I'm open to learning new skills and I'm naturally a good team player and curious person.
