Friend Advice Please!!
So recently, my friend got into a new relationship with one of the boys in our class who has liked her for a while. They never kept it a secret, but they only told a few people they were together, and that later spread. Once the "popular" group caught wind, they decided to talk to her boyfriend and about her and why he was dating her (I say popular in quotations because they aren't really popular, they're just a large friend group that has been together all through kindergarten, but most of the new kids who come into this group think they are popular because of the way they act.) Anyway, apparently a few of these "popular" kids and rando people in our class think that my friend is not good enough for him because she won't give him anything. My friend's bf told her about this and once she heard this, she has been very down lately, but she thinks she needs to confront them about talking about her behind her back to her bf. However, once getting advice from her bf, he told her not to tell them about it, because that would only create more drama, and he thinks it would backfire. What should my friend do, because she's decided to dm them, but realized that talking them in person would be easier, but she's very introverted so she wouldn't know how to confront them.
