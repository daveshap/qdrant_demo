Best Friend Secretly With My Ex?😞
So , i’m going through a akward breakup right now. See my ex boyfriend was in a difficult relationship and i was kind of like his guide to help him get through. You know the story..we got together😂. The first month or so was AMAZING. We would fall asleep on FaceTime together talking about anything, sharing our insecurities,etc. I guess I ignored the signs he kind of liked my friend.. he kind of ghosted me for 4 days. So me and my best friend set him up! He was answering NONE of my calls, so an hour later she came over and called him, he answered within seconds. Didn’t even answer my texts asking if everything’s alright, nope, left opened. She told him to call me because I was worried. His answer? “Why.” I broke down right there. I then broke up with him and had some excuses but i had enough. things went into an off and on relationship but, overall it was over. I did my retail therapy and got over it. Then, I see his name on the top of her snapchat a lot..not wierd right? How about when I tell you she shows me a strong majority of her snapchat messages without it even being my concern or business but if he texts she’s quick to not open it until I’m out of sight..I don’t want to seem controlling OR clingy. But, something just seems up...any ideas or tips? I could use it. Eh, back to retail therapy. Maybe I should let it be,I feel so annoying right now..
