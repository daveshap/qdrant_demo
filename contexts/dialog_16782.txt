STANLEY: They look pretty smart, I think.
JULIA: No they don't --
RICHARD: What are they gonna do -- beat us?
STANLEY: Maybe.
JULIA: We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
RICHARD: When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
JIMMY: You look great.
PAULA: What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
JIMMY: ...you know...
PAULA: Did your wife find out?
JIMMY: No.
PAULA: Then what?
JIMMY: It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around. I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
PAULA: -- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon. Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
JIMMY: I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
JIMMY: Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
PAULA: All your other fluzzies?
JIMMY: Yeah. Yes.
PAULA: You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
PAULA: Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
JIMMY: Yes.
PAULA: Will you say my name?
JIMMY: If she asks me any question I want to tell her. I want to tell her everything I've done.
PAULA: Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
PAULA: Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy. I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
JIMMY: I won't.
PAULA: What happend to you?
JIMMY: I got in trouble at school.
PAULA: Are you ok?
JIMMY: Fuck no.
