LENORE: What do you do for a living?
THEO: Sometimes I paint.
LENORE: Our house always needs touching up.
THEO: Pictures.
LENORE: I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
THEO: They say my work is somewhat derivative.
LENORE: I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
THEO: Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
LENORE: I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you. Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
THEO: Shit, stop with the money! I never asked for a nickel. I was just doing this. And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
LENORE: I didn't mean to. It's just the way I am.
THEO: A price on everything.
LENORE: I wasn't always like that. I don't think I was.
THEO: I'm about ten blocks from the school.
LENORE: I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
THEO: That makes two of us.
LENORE: You're breaking up. I can't hear you. Theo?
THEO: There are cables overhead. Hang on. It'll clear up.
LENORE: I've lost you. You're gone. I can't hear anything.
