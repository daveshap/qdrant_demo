My boss has given me a month to come up with a 5 year plan. What do I do?
Hi everyone. A little background on me to start.

I am a 24 year old woman. I never got a degree after high school due to personal reasons and instead got into retail. I worked my way up really quickly to manager, but then my mum got sick. I got an office job working inbound calls Monday to Friday (so I could visit her regularly on weekends). The company is one of the top 10 well known companies in my country. 

I have been there 9 months now and I love it. It's a company that I personally trust, it has been extremely good to me and it's the first time I feel valued. In return, I have put my hard work into it. At around 7 months I was promoted to where I am now, which is handling complaints and investigating if were liable to any damages we might cause customers. 

I had my first quality assurance review yesterday and scored pretty well. My boss confided in me that she sees a lot of potential in me and compared me to someone who started where I did and now in a senior management position. She said that if my score is the same or better next time, she wants to know where I want to be in five years and help me get there. She mentioned that the company could even put me on study leave if that's work it took. 

The problem is, I feel numb! This could be a life changing opportunity and I dont want to ruin it. I know that I was to be customer focused. I strive for customer service and i want to strive to make sure the customers are getting the best experience. 

I would love any advice on this, whether it be where I want to go, if I want to study.. I live in a very expensive city and the only reason I do is because I live with my parents. I would love to be able to move out and not struggle too much.
