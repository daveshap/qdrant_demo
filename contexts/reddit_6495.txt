Why do so many companies ghost you after applying?
One thing I dislike about work and applying for jobs in general is how if you get rejected, you either don’t hear back and have to figure that out on your own, or if you are, you won’t hear back for MONTHS sometimes. Keep in mind that looking for a job in some cases is a job in itself, and I wish companies at least were a little more time sensitive because of that. Hell, I also wish that they at least gave you a reason why you didn’t get the job instead of letting you ruminate over the potential causes. I understand that I’m likely being overly naive and idealistic, but getting a job (or rather, getting a GOOD job) is tough. And yes, I understand that it’s a two way street: potential employees should follow up, since HR and recruiting can be a mess...but still. I just wish this whole process was a little more compassionate.
