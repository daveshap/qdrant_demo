VIVIAN: You asshole! I can't believe what a --!
EDWARD: Vivian, what the --
VIVIAN: Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?! What are you trying to prove!? I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
EDWARD: I don't know what you're talking about.
VIVIAN: I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
EDWARD: Would you please calm down. Tell me what happened.
VIVIAN: Stuckey! He wants an appointment" with me after you leave. You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?"
EDWARD: What was I supposed to do? I told the truth. Why should the truth upset you? It's not as if you're from a convent.
VIVIAN: I want my fucking money. I'm getting out of here. I don't want anything more to do with you.
EDWARD: Can we talk about this? Can you just try to calm down?
VIVIAN: Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
VIVIAN: Well, it's true. Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
EDWARD: Vivian...
VIVIAN: Pay me! Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
EDWARD: Fine. I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
VIVIAN: Fuck off.
EDWARD: I'll call you a cab. If you want the clothes, pack them up.
EDWARD: Vivian... I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did. I should have known that it would hurt you.
VIVIAN: I'm not hurt. It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
EDWARD: I really am sorry.
