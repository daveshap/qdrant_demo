i catch myself wanting to go “home” but not knowing where that even is
i catch myself saying it in a room of people, at work, while driving, while in my bed, while eating in a restaurant. doesn’t matter where. it’s just always playing in my mind. i’ve never really felt at home anywhere, and i hate saying it because of that.
