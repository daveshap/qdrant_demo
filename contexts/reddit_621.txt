So i have a Guilty conscious, Advice?

This is a bit long, TLDR near the bottom


Ok so a few years ago me and my internet best friend (i only have internet friends) were talking and he had expressed that he liked me, i kinda picked up on some vibes here and there but i chalked it up to me being overly confident (not confident) or me being narcissistic (kinda am) so i wasnt sure, anyway he confesses and out of the heat of the moment i get caught up and convince myself that i liked him too....I DONT! We flirted fo a solid HOUR then he says hes going to sleep, cool thats how we usually end our conversations cause we talk for a while, anyway a few hours have passed, and the absolute wooorst heaviness in my chest, and guilt set in, because i was finally like "oh fuck" cause i didnt want to hurt him but i wanted to rip the band aid off so i wouldn't lead him on, sooo i kinda end up texting him a fucking essay basically saying im sorry for getting caught up in the moment and i hope we can still be friends yada yada yada, And. Then. I. Block.him., like Wtf how shitty is that?!?! Ughh anyways i un block him, he also blocked me, i was depressed for months, i contacted him through other means, and we start talking again and it was like we never stopped talking. 

ANYWAY we are super cool he has a girlfriend cassy (such a sweetheart) and i have tried dating but i still feel too guilty and i worry that ill do that to someone else unintentionally and hurt them!!!

:TLDR: I want to get back into dating but i feel guilty and i dont know how to stop feeling so guilty, like i can feel guilty for not getting through the level in panda pop because the pandas were in the buble too long, and it takes at least a hour to stop feeling bad so i dont know how to stop feeling guilty about this


Also im sorry i rant so much

Oh and me and him call this the "incident" or "what happened" and joke about it
