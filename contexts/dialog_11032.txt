MICHAEL: You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
OLA: Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
MICHAEL: Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny. He only handles specific areas of the family business. Tom?
HAGEN: Sure, Mikey.
HAGEN: If you need anything, just...
MICHAEL: Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
OLA: I just left our friend in Miami.
MICHAEL: How is his health?
OLA: Not good.
MICHAEL: Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
OLA: He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
OLA: The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys. In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami. He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean. Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
MICHAEL: He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated. I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
OLA: He always makes money for his partners. One by one, our old friends are gone. Death, natural or not, prison, deported. Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.
KAY: Anthony, Daddy's busy.
MICHAEL: This is my boy, and my wife. Mr. John Ola of Miami.
KAY: I'm sorry, Michael. Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left. Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
MICHAEL: Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
MICHAEL: Kay.
KAY: Yes, Michael.
