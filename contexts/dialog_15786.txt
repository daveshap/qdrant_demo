SERA: So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
CONVENTIONEER: Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
SERA: Where are you staying?
CONVENTIONEER: Right here at the hotel. Why?
SERA: Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
CONVENTIONEER: A date. What, are you a hooker? What do you mean a date? I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
SERA: I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
SERA: Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
CONVENTIONEER: Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
