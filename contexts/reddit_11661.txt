This is random but I need to vent somewhere.
I recently came across this video on YouTube where this girl eats food and talks about crime. Idk weird stuff but I’m into it lol. One of the videos explained the crime that was in the new “don’t fuck with cats” documentary. I decided to read through the comments and accidentally came across a comment where someone explains how this man killed these innocent kittens and my heart broke. I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m dramatic and extremely sensitive towards animal abuse. I read this comment a week ago and it’s still bothering me 😭 to the point where I watched a random tik tok video (I won’t go into details but it wasn’t even a bad video) and it triggered me into thinking about these kittens. I don’t know why??? I guess I just don’t get why people hurt innocent animals. But does anyone else react to sensitive situations like this?
