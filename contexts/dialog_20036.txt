PENNY: That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
EVERETT: Now Penny, stop that!
PENNY: No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
EVERETT: I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
PENNY: I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
EVERETT: ...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
