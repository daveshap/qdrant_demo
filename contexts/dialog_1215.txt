DAVID: How long have I been here?
DR. HIRSCH: You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
DAVID: Two weeks?
DR. HIRSCH: You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
DAVID: Lunatic?
DR. HIRSCH: Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
DAVID: It wasn't a lunatic.
ALEX: I beg your pardon?
DAVID: It was a wolf.
ALEX: What?
DAVID: A wolf.
DR. HIRSCH: Did he say a wolf?
ALEX: Yes, I believe he did.
