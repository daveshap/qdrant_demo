How does Apple achieve the all aluminium enclosure with RF on the MacBook Pro? Since 2016, Apple has been able to make these laptops with no visible \u201cwindow\u201d of plastic or glass for RF signals to travel through. As an electrical engineer, I\u2019m intrigued. If you look at older MacBook pros, they have a black plastic hinge. For the Pixel chrome book, it\u2019s got a whole glass half of the lid for that. My guess was the hinge or the glass screen, but neither would work when the lid is closed, and you can very much use your MBP while the lid is fully closed with WiFi and Bluetooth (think when you have external displays). How does Bluetooth and WiFi work on the 2018 MacBook Pro models?
