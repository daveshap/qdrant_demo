Is there a career out there that would suit someone who enjoys in-depth research and who also likes tracking things?
I'm addicted to information: I love reading about new topics and exploring them in-depth. I like reading through scientific papers on topics to see what the evidence-based studies say. I often have like 30 tabs open on Chrome at the same time, most of which are interesting things I'm reading about or watching.

I also like to track things. I regularly update my Excel personal budget and I've previously tracked stuff like calories, steps, weights lifted at the gym.

The last thing I really enjoy doing is writing. I am good at explaining technical concepts to a non-technical audience. 

I have a degree in a math/stats discipline.

Is there any career that could in some way combine these three interests? The first thing that came to mind was a data analyst but I would appreciate some other suggestions. When I picture myself as a data analyst, I don't feel much excitement and I think a modicum of fire in the belly should be a prerequisite to pursue any career. 

Thanks for any advice.
