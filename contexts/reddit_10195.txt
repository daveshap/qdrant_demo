Does anyone else just feel like disappearing socially? Nuking social media, cutting ties to your family & friends, etc?
I am so beyond tired of waking up day in and day out to these negative and intrusive feelings and thoughts being played on repeat in my head. It's to the point where I've been giving more and more thought to just "disappearing" from people's lives. Not even saying goodbye -- just disappearing. Obliterating every real connection that I have so I can slip further and further into solitude. Maybe I just want to make it easier for when I finally decide to off myself. I don't know. 

What I do know is that everything feels so... pointless. I can't stop feeling numb and empty. 

I just want to sever all my ties and connections so I can be alone. So I can self-destruct alone.

I can't even remember a time where I felt OK. I don't think I'll ever feel OK again. And it's not ok to feel this way. No one should ever, ever have to feel this way. Ever. 

But yet, some of us do. And it fucking sucks. I wish I could just absorb all the bad feelings everyone in the world has and just take them with me to the grave.
