LACHAISE: I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
BOND: Who did you get it from?
LACHAISE: I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
BOND: And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
LACHAISE: Your last chance. Take the money.
BOND: Your last chance. Give me the name.
LACHAISE: Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
