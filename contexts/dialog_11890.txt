MEEKER: I am. Ben Meeker.
LOOMIS: Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
MEEKER: Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
LOOMIS: Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
MEEKER: That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
LOOMIS: He's here, Sheriff.
MEEKER: Why?
LOOMIS: 10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
MEEKER: Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
LOOMIS: Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
MEEKER: Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
LOOMIS: Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
MEEKER: Hank, call the troopers and check his story out. And assuming what you say is true..
LOOMIS: Its true, Sheriff.
MEEKER: All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
LOOMIS: Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
