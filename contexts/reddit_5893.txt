Whats the best way to get business schooling when I have a bachelor's degree in a diffetent field?
To make a long story short, I graduated with a degree in English teaching, but decided to have a different career. 

I have a job now that pays much more than teaching, with growth opportunities, a fun environment, and that doesn't require work being brought home with me so I can focus on my husband and future family. Not only that, but I am really good at it.

The position I have is a mix between sales and customer support. My main objective is getting users registered to our product, and building relationships with them, so we can help them buy and sell their assets using our portal. I am crazy good at it, and want to stay with the company for the foreseeable future.

However, I still would like some sort of schooling to help me out. I would love to take some marketing classes and maybe even get my MBA. Is there a better, cheaper option though?
