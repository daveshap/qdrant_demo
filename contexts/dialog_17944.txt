JAD: The victim's name is Leo Crow.
ANDERTON: Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow. And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
JAD: I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
ANDERTON: Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record. Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
