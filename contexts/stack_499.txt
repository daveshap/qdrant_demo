Mysterious NTFS writes long after copying data to it I copied 50GB of Videos to my external  USB3.0 5tb HDD that uses one big NTFS partition. This worked as expected and with good speed.However, after it's done, there are audible write accesses to the disk for hours. If i disconnect the HDD and reconnect it, these writes just continue! After sitting it out for a couple of hours, it stops.What's going on? Should I be worried?Effects are reproducible under my Ubuntu 16.04. Same does not occur under Windows. If someone has a good idea how to debug/investigate this, let me know...
