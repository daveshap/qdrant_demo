How to find which adjectives modify which nouns? I've always wanted to to find the answer to such questions as the following:Which adjectives are commonly used to describe pain?Which nouns are commonly modified by the adjective acute?You can certainly find the answer if you look into usage examples in the dictionary or if you poke around in a thesaurus, but the answer is not always found directly. I couldn't even find a list of bi-grams that addressed this specific construct. Similarly, I would like to know which verbs commonly associate with which subjects and which objects and vice versa. Where do I find such information? And should this not be in a thesaurus?
