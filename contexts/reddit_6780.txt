Recruiter wants last 4 of social?
I was contacted by a recruiter from ICONMA about a contract position with Google. They seem to have good glassdoor reviews (at least no one is claiming to have been scammed). Is it odd that I was asked for the last 4 digits of my social? I was also asked to provide birthday day and month but without the year. Lastly, they need my full legal name as it appears on SS; this part seems normal although there was a heavy emphasis on cannot deviate from SS card at all, including omitting or abbreviating your middle name.
