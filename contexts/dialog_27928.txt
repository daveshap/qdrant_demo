GALBRAITH: Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
JERRY: Some other time.
CHARLIE: I'm sick.
JERRY: Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
CHARLIE: No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
CHARLIE: I don't know. I want to see Robles.
JERRY: What do you want to see him for?
CHARLIE: I want him to lock me up.
JERRY: Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
CHARLIE: I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
