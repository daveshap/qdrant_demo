A strange proper name Why the complete name of British philosopher McTaggart, i.e. John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart, has such an strange form?Edit: Considering @Lawrence concerns, I should note that, although strangeness is a somehow subjective matter, but it's objectively based on the lack of similar cases. In this case, I have never seen a compound proper name with a repeated part. I guess the two McTaggarts refer to two different persons (ex., the philosopher and his father). This theory may be confirmed/rejected by historical notes; or at least by providing more examples, one may reduce its degree of strangeness to non natives!
