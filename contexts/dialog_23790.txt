JACK: Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
MILES: Thanks, Jack. So do I. Here we are.
MILES: So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
JACK: I told you. Filet and salmon.
MILES: Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
JACK: I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
MILES: Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
JACK: Let me call Christine.
MILES: Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
JACK: I owe her a call anyway.
