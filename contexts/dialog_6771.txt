BELLA: But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M. No blow jobs. No screwing.
JACK: Why did you quit?
BELLA: I got scared.
JACK: I can imagine.
BELLA: Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
JACK: You called the casino a cesspit.
BELLA: Well it is. But I know where I am.
BELLA: I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
JACK: I despise the job.
BELLA: Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
