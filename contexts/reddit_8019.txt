Do grad schools disburse tuition grants evenly each semester?
I was given a 25% grant when I started grad school. It's my first semester and I noticed that in addition to this semester's 25% grant an additional 33% grant is listed in my bill. I never applied for any scholarships or grants, so this is a surprise.

Is it possible that they are giving me next semester's grant now, or is this a gift?
