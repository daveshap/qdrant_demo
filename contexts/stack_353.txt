How smoothly does Xcode 10.1 run on 2017 MacBook Pro base model (8 GB RAM/128 GB SSD)? I am planning to buy a 2017 MacBook Pro base model (8 GB RAM/128 GB SSD) for iOS app development and I am on a budget.I would appreciate if I get answer to the following questions before I decide to purchase:Does current version of Xcode (10.1) and iOS Simulator run smoothly without lag on this Mac? or do I need more RAM and SSD and more powerful CPU?How fast the 128 GB SSD fills with Xcode project files if I use the machine only for app development purpose?Can I move old Xcode project files to an external disk in order to free up space on internal drive (and copy old Xcode project files back to internal drive as needed)?Can I directly save and run Xcode project files from external disk without using the internal drive?
