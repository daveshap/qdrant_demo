What are the strongest legal arguments on both sides of the same sex wedding cake case currently before the US Supreme Court?
The supreme court will hear a case where a cake baker refused to bake a wedding cake for a same sex wedding.


“We asked for a cake,” Mr. Craig said. “We didn’t ask for a piece of art or for him to make a statement for us. He simply turned us away because of who we are.”


However, the baker (Phillips) has an interesting argument: he is willing to serve the couple, just not willing to make a cake that promotes something against his belief. He argues that he is being compelled to "speak", not just serve customers.


“I’ll make you birthday cakes, shower cakes, cookies, brownies,” Mr. Phillips recalled saying. “I just can’t make a cake for a same-sex wedding.”
