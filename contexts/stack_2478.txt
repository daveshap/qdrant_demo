Download custom extent from WMTS I need to download image patches from a WMTS server. However, WMTS only allows to request tiles specified by row and column of the tile matrix.What I need to achieve is some kind of \"WMS-like\" query which lets me specify a spatial bounding box. I am aware that there is no server-side processing on WMTS servers. Therefore I am looking for a workaround.I achieve the desired result by adding the WMTS as a layer to QGIS and use the \"Save as...\" function of the layer, which lets me specify the spatial extent and resolution. Since I need to do this for ten-thousands of image patches I need to find a way to automate this. Unfortunately, FME does not have a reader for WMTS.Any ideas?
