I lost my will to live a long time ago, I've done my best to get through it doesn't get better.
I only felt like living when I was with my ex. Everything had meaning, it seemed like there was a purpose to life since we were together,  and if there wasn't well I felt content we had each other.  Since he left 2 years ago now,  I've tried to move on,  act like I can do it on my own,  my heart isn't in this life anymore,  everything is dull and boring knowing he is gone.  I've also cried and cried and felt the pain my heart feels, I live with a heavy heart everyday. I can't stop loving him,  missing him,  wanting to be with him.  I look back and remember when I felt I had found that something that was always missing,  and now it's gone,  I've lost that spark.  I really don't think I'll ever truly get it back.  I think I will forever just remember those years as if they were some fantasy,  and now I live in the harsh reality of human existence and have been and will. The truth is I have lost all faith in all the things people tell you like time will heal it,  stay busy,  do things you love,  feel the pain and let it out,  I've done it all,  and still have a heavy heart that wants nothing more than to be with him.  I will continue to live life but nothing can help me,  this is just the way it is for me now.
