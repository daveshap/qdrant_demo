Ghosted after receiving an offer and tentative start?
I recently graduated this past spring and was incredibly fortunate to land a great job in the midst of COVID. However, after completing the necessary steps (background, drug test, etc) I have not heard from the employer in over a month. My offer was contingent on successfully completing those steps. I'm trying to be understanding and recognize that the world did collectively get rocked by the pandemic, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pretty disappointed with how the company (which is huge and very well known btw) is handling onboarding. I'm still interviewing and applying for jobs because at this point I don't really feel like I have a job. I'm super curious: has anyone else ever experienced anything like this?
