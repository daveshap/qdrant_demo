How can I improve my job interview technique?
I've had multiple interviews since I graduated last year, including several for "dream" positions that I desperately wanted. Each time I was told I was a strong, well qualified candidate but ultimately they'd decided to go with someone else. I'm starting to feel like a failure, it's been 6 months since I graduated and I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere. 

I clearly need to improve how I'm coming across in interviews but I'm not really sure where to start or how to develop these skills. I'm not the most extroverted person by nature but I don't think I show any obvious major flaws like excessive nerves etc. I am worried maybe I'm too understated and have issues selling myself convincingly due to a lack of confidence. I also don't think I'm necessarily good at bluffing questions on issues that I'm weaker on. At the same time I'm feeling more and more anxious that the longer I'm unemployed, that's going to be count against me in future applications. I know this is quite general and broad, but I just had my third rejection in two weeks so honestly any advice would be welcome.
