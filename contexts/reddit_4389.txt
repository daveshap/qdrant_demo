If you're glued to your bed right now...
Take a second. Breathe in, breathe out. Remind yourself that being idle will not solve any of your problems. 

Do your best to get up out of bed. Stretch your legs, touch your toes, bend and twist and work out the kinks in your muscles and hear your joints crack as they come alive. 

Brush your teeth, take a shower, and put on some nice clothes. Pick out your favourite outfit and wear it out for a walk. Wear it to school, wear it to work, wear it to the grocery store. 

Get fresh and try to focus on feeling pride in the fact that you, an individual, came up with this outfit. You got out of bed, brushed your teeth, took a shower, and came alive. 

It helps a little bit. It helped me today after I woke up and cried for about an hour. You guys should try to skip that step if you can, I don't recommend it. It can be therapeutic sometimes tho. 

Much love to y'all, good luck.
