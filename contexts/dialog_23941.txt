STELLA: Some people think because they're stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I've seen a lot of that. But it's only true if you let it be. The world is what you make of it.

STELLA: I'm ready for that.
STELLA: How about you?
PADEN: I don't want you to get hurt.
STELLA: He can't hurt me if he's dead.
