Lost command block! I was tinkering with a new command configuration, and I placed a repeating command block underground that gives me superspeed.  I forgot to take it's coordinates, and I left. I was testing range, and I found it NEVER. WEARS. OFF. I can't find it anymore, and I can't turn it off!! I'm in a superflat world, so I can't really remember the place from surroundings. And now I'm stuck with level 15 speed effect.Is there a /testforblock command that will look in a large radius, not just one block?
