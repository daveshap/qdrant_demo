I feel pathetic for posting this, but I’m gonna try to go to sleep, and it would mean a lot to me just to have a few nice comments when I wake up. It doesn’t have to be much, but if you could just say something that would be awesome. I just want to feel like someone cares. It’s been a bad night. :(
Edit: Thank you everyone who reached out to me last night :’) If I had the energy, I would reply to every single message I got. I really appreciate y’all’s support and I’m gonna try to make each day better than the last!
