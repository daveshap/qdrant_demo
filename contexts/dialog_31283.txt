SCHAEFFER: He'll live.
RACHEL: You might have killed him!
SCHAEFFER: Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
SAMUEL: Is it them?
BOOK: It's them, Sam. Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
SAMUEL: Are they going to kill you?
BOOK: Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
SAMUEL: What are you going to do?
BOOK: I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
SAMUEL: Don't let them hurt you.
BOOK: I won't. Now run. Fast as you can!
