They say god removes people from your life for the better... too bad I was the one he removed
I miss my wife, I miss being a husband, I miss having our family under one house. I regret taking her for granted I lost the family I married into who accepted me and loved me for who I was never judging unlike my family. I lost it all and I have no one to blame but myself. I realized that they don’t respond to texts because they hate me but because I alienated myself so bad that they don’t want to deal with me.
