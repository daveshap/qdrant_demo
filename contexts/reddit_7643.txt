How to update CV/Resume when you haven't been doing real research yet?
I've been at my graduate school for roughly a year as a Ph.D. student. One of my advisors said I need to update my CV to reflect my time here and to ask someone I know for help. 

The problem is, she's been doing actual research work in the lab while I'm involved with a project at its very beginning and have mostly been reading and summarizing papers for my group. I'm not sure how to put this on my CV at all!
