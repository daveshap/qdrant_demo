HAWKEYE: Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
MAGUA: Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
HAWKEYE: Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
