iMac doesn\u2018t start up My iMac doesn\u2019t start up. The loading bar doesn\u2019t fill up and then, after 10 minutes or so, it shuts down. I tried to get in the recovery mode, but there is the Macintosh HD drive grey and it says \u201enot active\u201c.Any help or advice on how to solve it? Thanks(I haven\u2018t saved my files on a external hard drive and I don\u2018t want to lose it)Macos 10.13Update:  So i think it tries to repairs the volume repair volume and then some error messages one says invalid number of threads and then it tries again and then something fails and it shuts down.
