MR. ROSE: You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
PEACHES: They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
MR. ROSE: Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? *Half* of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well *step* on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
CANDY: Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
HOMER: So we should wait and see." For how long?"
CANDY: I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
HOMER: Fine. That's all there is to it then.
CANDY: No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
HOMER: Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
CANDY: It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
