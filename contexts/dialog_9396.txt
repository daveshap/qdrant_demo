CLERK: Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
DUKE: WHAT? What was that crazy bitch said to him? There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
CLERK: Killed?
DUKE: IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
CLERK: Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
DUKE: Tell me. What do you want?
CLERK: The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
DUKE: Crying? Why was she crying?
CLERK: Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
DUKE: Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
CLERK: Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
DUKE: Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
CLERK: What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
DUKE: Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
GONZO: Good work. They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
DUKE: Lucy is looking for you.
GONZO: No, she's looking for you.
DUKE: Me?
GONZO: She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself. I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
