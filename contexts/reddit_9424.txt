Free tomato soup
Hello I just wanted to share a simple tomato soup recipe that actually tastes like tomato soup. This is for anyone struggling to afford food.

-1 ketchup packet 
-Hot water
-(optional) small packet of coffee creamer
-(optional) crackers
-salt pepper packets

Just mix the ketchup and hot water into a bowl. Add salt and pepper to it. If you find free coffee creamer somewhere, throw that in too. There you have it, free tomato soup and it actually tastes like Campbell's tomato soup. 

Edit: I only posted this as a final resort. I'm not saying that this should replace a trip to the food bank but rather if the trip to the food bank fails.
