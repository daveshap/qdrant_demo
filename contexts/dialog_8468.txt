ED: 250,000?
BAUM: In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
ED: What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
BAUM: I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
ED: You're kidding, right? Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
