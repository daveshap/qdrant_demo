Living at my mom's to save money during Master's or go move to the program further away?
 

Got accepted to both Masters of Public Health programs at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and University of Virginia (UVA) in Virginia this fall and will be moving back down from DC but am on the fence about which would set me up better career wise and whether the cost of livings savings from going to VCU offsets it's less stellar program. Tuition cost isn't a factor since work is paying for it (yay!) Here is what I perceive to be pros and cons right now but if anyone can add to these or correct my assumptions that would be great

VCU

Pros: Older program est. in the 90s, Great reputation for health sciences and probably the best reputation for MPH in the state (VA as a whole doesn't have crazy good programs but whatever), good reputation for their epi program, cheap or potentially free cost of living if I decide to live with my mom, Richmond is my hometown so I'm very familiar with the area and still have friends there, Connections with state dept of health and state capitol being nearby, research focus on tobacco use which is line with my personal interests and background.

Cons: Generalist program (no concentrations offered), health policy dept doesn't seem to do much with the MPH program and that's the field I'm more interested in, I've heard rumors that the PhD program is disorganized but the MPH program "should be fine" and VCU administration is a bit of a clusterfuck

UVA

Pros: Offers health policy, law, and ethics concentration that appeals to me, opportunity to get a degree from the best public school in the state, new experience with living in Charlottesville, connections with the Batten School for Public Policy, stronger potential for networking with alums if I decide to get involved with politics, new data science school is forthcoming

Cons: Newer program as of 2007 with un-established reputation, a bit higher cost of living compared with Richmond, do not have many current connections with the city and probably wouldn't want to stay there after I graduate

Thanks for your help!
