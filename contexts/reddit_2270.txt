Putting TikTok on my college app
Hi guys, also no this is not a troll post lol

I have over 75k followers on TikTok and am wondering if I should put it on my college app.  All of my videos are very family friendly, literally none of them have any swears or offensive capability.  In addition, I have sort of an environmental spike in my app and a lot of my TikToks are environmental.  The video that got me “popular” was environmental and has 6.2m views.   This is a big part of my life so I feel like I should put it.  Any input?
