HOT PANTS: Why should I?
BANDIT: Because I need your help, sweet thing. And I need it bad.
HOT PANTS: I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
BANDIT: Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
BANDIT: What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
HOT PANTS: Yes.
BANDIT: I'm begging.
HOT PANTS: I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
BANDIT: But you'll do it?
HOT PANTS: I'll do it.
BANDIT: I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
HOT PANTS: You sure do.
