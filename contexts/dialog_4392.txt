PEARL: You got his hands. Beautiful hands. I didn't even know. That night. When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me. Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
CINNABAR: But if it's him. If he's really come back, won't he know us? Love us?
PEARL: Sure, if it was really him. But it isn't that simple. Jimmy's body died a long time ago. And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
CINNABAR: But how do you know? Maybe he just wanted to see us? And now he's gone again. And you've all killed my father for the second time.
