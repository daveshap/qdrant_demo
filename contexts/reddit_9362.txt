We just lost our oven, everything is falling apart and I don’t know what to do
After cooking dinner our oven started smoking from the broiler which hasn’t been working for months. Everything was off so it was a major shock. My mother and I moved it enough so I could unplug it. (It’s electric.) The heat wouldn’t stop and smoke was filling the house so we called the fire department. They came and moved it from the house. They weren’t sure what caused it, a power surge or something. 

So now we don’t have an oven and we can’t currently afford one. We are a family if four so we used it pretty much every night. I’m debating  using my leftover 200$ in my college savings to try and find one at our local habit for humanity but then I will kinda be stranded for my freshman year of college. But we have to have an oven. We have a crockpot still, could we survive on this for a while? Can you cook pasta in a crockpot? Would a hotplate work? 

Sorry I’m very flustered.

Edit: Wow, thank you all so much. I was very panicked before but I’m feeling a bit calmer now thanks to all your replies. I’m following all your advice and looking into everything, thank you so much!

Edit 2: I wanted to thank you all again. The crockpot recipes, griddle ideas, the ways to get around meals the involve using a stove. People have even offered their old appliances. My family is kinda alone up here. When something goes wrong it’s bad and we’re all alone. So when everyone jumped up and surround me with support here, I was crazy overwhelmed and just cried. I feel a lot better today and feel like I can take think a lot more clearly. Not the panicked mess I was last night. Thank you so much for all the love.
