What are the Pros, Cons, or Consequences of Shutting down the U.S. Southern Border?
4 Days ago President Trump threatened to shut down the border and made various comments on the subject:

[*"If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing!"*](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1111650176345800705)

["*[Mexico is] gonna stop them and if they don't stop them we are closing the border, we'll keep it closed for a long time, i'm not playing games."*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-threatens-to-close-the-southern-border-next-week-voicing-heightened-frustration-with-mexico/2019/03/29/cb61c190-5211-11e9-88a1-ed346f0ec94f_story.html) | **[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsuYiNTHm-E)**

[“Mexico will have to do something otherwise I'm closing the border. I’ll just close the border, and with a deficit like we have with Mexico and have had for many years, closing the border will be a profit-making operation, when you close the border you ill also stop a lot of the drugs coming in...”](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/436522-trump-very-good-likelihood-of-closing-us-mexico-border-next-week) | **[Video Link](https://youtu.be/WyUdMxpb5fM?t=232)**

He also made threats in [December](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1078625779670503426), (including repeating it as a ["profit making operation"](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1078632205210058752?s=20)) [November](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/11/22/donald-trump-southern-border-shut-down-mexico-migrant-caravan-immigration/2086291002/), and [October](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/19/658962085/trump-threatens-southern-border-shutdown-over-migrant-caravan) of 2018.

Economically, Socially, (Geo)politically speaking...

**What do experts say are the Pros of shutting down the southern border?**

**What do they say are the Cons of shutting down the southern border?**

**Does a border shutdown have ramifications for the USMCA trade deal?**

**Has the Southern Border been shut down before and did it end up being a profit-making operation? Generally speaking, when a country shuts down a border with a neighbor with whom it has a trade deficit, does it lead to a net economic gain?**
