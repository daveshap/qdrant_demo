Does anyone else’s anxiety cause abdominal issues?
After moving a year and a half ago I started having bouts of severe abdominal cramping followed with...lets just say it sped things up. This has happened once or twice a month for 17 months now and I never had prior issues. My doc thinks it’s just irritable bowel (a really common thing especially with anxiety) I’m worried about something like Crohn’s disease with how bad the cramping can get. All my bloods were normal except low B12 implying some level of malabsorption.

Still I’m just curious if anyone with anxiety like me has had GI upset from it often, I never had issues before but obviously moving was quite a jump and stressful time.

EDIT: I was tested for Celiac, since my father had it they actually checked for the gene and I do not carry it. So that’s ruled out 99.9%
