Data Integrity and authenticity check I am trying to shift from 12.04 LTS to 16.04.3 LTS desktop amd64 through a fresh install (iso file download on a DVD).In the process, is it necessary to verify the Ubuntu download prior to installation - its a bit complicated for me! ;)Secondly, is there a way to know whether my computer hardware is compatible with 16.04.3?Thanks for the reply.
