JERRY: You look great.
LIZA: Thanks.
JERRY: Are you okay? I wish I hadn't told you what I did. But I can't help the way I feel. You don't hold that against me, do you?
LIZA: No. That wouldn't be fair. Where are we going, Jerry?
JERRY: It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you. But first things first.
LIZA: What is it?
JERRY: There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
