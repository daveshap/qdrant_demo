MARGE: Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
MEREDITH: You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
MARGE: I told you! I knew it!
MEREDITH: Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
MARGE: How would you know that?
MEREDITH: He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
PETER: No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
MARGE: Do you know Tom?
