ROY: I'm a salesman.
MYRA: You're on the grift. Same as me.
ROY: Myra, I'm not following this.
MYRA: Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.

MYRA: The long end. Big con.
ROY: Nobody does that single-o.
MYRA: I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
