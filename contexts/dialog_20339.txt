CRISWELL: ...And what is this?
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: A symbol, Master.
CRISWELL: What kind of symbol?
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: She loved the bull ring and the matador. She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction. Her dance is of skulls.
CRISWELL: She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
CRISWELL: Her dance has pleased me.
