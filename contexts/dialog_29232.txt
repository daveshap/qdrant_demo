JUNIOR: When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
BABE BROTHER: You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
JUNIOR: You used that excuse to get out of the army.
BABE BROTHER: You always got something to say.
GIDEON: Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
BABE BROTHER: I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
GIDEON: What did your wife get her?
BABE BROTHER: We got the same thing.
