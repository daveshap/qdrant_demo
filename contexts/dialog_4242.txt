SATTLER: I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
CARDENAS: I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
SATTLER: An inquiry into what?
CARDENAS: For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
SATTLER: Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
CARDENAS: Did I say it was a natural death?
SHARON: You're on vacation, remember? You're supposed to be relaxing.
DULANEY: I am relaxing.
SHARON: This is not relaxing.
DULANEY: Really?
SHARON: Really.
DULANEY: And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
SHARON: If you want me to.
DULANEY: I'm always open to learning new things.
