I heard dating is strange in the States. Is it true?
I'm (M24) from Jamaica, and a friend of mine who was in the states for months told me trying to date is way different here than it is there. 

He told me that it's actually weird to just walk up to a girl randomly and say hey in the States. He said that it could be viewed as assault, as the girl ‚Äùthe girl might not want to talk to you" is that true? You have to meet women at social events and online. 

In Jamaica... It's weird if you don't approach women... You'll just be sitting there.. alone. If a girl doesn't like you she'll let you know or you might get a number that isn't let's say... Accurate lol. 

Personally, I love the rush! The anxiety you get sometimes before approaching a gorgeous woman. Even getting rejected, to realize that it isn't a big deal. 

Sometimes I go up to a woman say whatever comes to mind... Sometimes I stun myself... And her... Sometimes I say absolute shit and look like an idiot. It's fun. 

I really hope my bro is wrong.
