ENZO: He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
JOHANA: Have you known him long?
ENZO: Forever. We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
JOHANA: What was he like, when he was little?
ENZO: Little. Very little. And skinny, very skinny too. That is compared to me.
JOHANA: I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
ENZO: Exactly! What is it Johana? You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
