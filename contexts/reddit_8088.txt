Struggling with funding and financial planning.
I'm preparing to start a master's at George Mason in anthropology, I'm super excited about this opportunity and I can't wait to get started on my research!

However, as its getting closer to my start date, I'm realizing I only have enough saved for maybe one semester. I've been offered a federal loan of about $20,000/year and then about $2,800 in tuition reduction and another $2800 in a living stipend. Even with that money, I'd owe $3,300 out of pocket.

Given the absurd cost of living in the DC/ Northern Virginia area, this has been a really tough process and I'm not sure I have enough saved to afford the cost of attendance. I'm really struggling with trying to figure out my options here. If I try to defer for a year, I would have much more saved up (considering I just managed to work up to a high enough position at work to build savings, I'm currently bar tending as my gap year is coming to a close) to make it work and be in a place to develop a well-thought thesis and apply for more funding. However, I'm not sure how my advisor would react to my wanting/needing to put off school for another year.

I really don't want to defer, but I'm not sure what options I have. I could get some help from family but my parents have a few medical conditions that are taking up a lot of their finances at the moment. Any help/advice would be appreciated!

edit: loan is 20k, not 10 actually
