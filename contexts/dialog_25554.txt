OWEN: First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
LUKE: I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
OWEN: You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
LUKE: But you promised! I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
OWEN: I said we'd see. And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.' When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
LUKE: You used my savings! You stole my savings. If my father were here...
OWEN: Your father's dead. Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long. I don't want another word. Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
