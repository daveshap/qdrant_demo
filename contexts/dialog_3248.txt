ADAM: God, it's Jane Butterfield!
BARBARA: What's she doing here?
ADAM: I don't know. <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!
BARBARA: She can't see you, right? In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
ADAM: Won't? Or can't?
BARBARA: Just says 'won't.' Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
ADAM: Arrogant. That's Jane Butterfield all right...
BARBARA: At least we won't have to worry about her.
