BYRON: How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
ZACK: Yes, sir.
BYRON: Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
ZACK: I been calling for four months.
BYRON: Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
