I'm shocked by how much I miss human interaction
I was living in my college dorm with five other guys but moved back home this academic term once the quarantine was set in place. I haven't really felt right these past few weeks, and it dawned upon me one day that my newly-founded depression was caused by the complete lack of social interaction. I genuinely miss seeing my suitemate's silhouette out my door because I knew they were there to bother me about video games, studying, getting dinner, getting girls, etc. I was always the introvert of the group because I usually relied on them to take initiative. I literally having to sneak out of my apartment by the end of the quarter because I was never allowed to eat by myself. I won't deny that they could be hella stupid sometimes, but the energy was great and it made my otherwise miserable life at college bearable.  


I've eaten breakfast, lunch, and dinner by myself for the past month now. As stupid as it is, I'm sad that there's nobody to call me a homosexual because I don't have a girlfriend or chase me down across half the campus on their boosted board because I've "surpassed my quota" for the number of times I can eat alone per week. I've had nobody but myself during this quarantine and I honestly wish for things to go back to the way they were.  


**tl;dr**: I always thought I was a major introvert but being separated from my hooligan suitemates due to quarantine has me questioning everything I knew. Reposting this cause I somehow managed to screw up the title
