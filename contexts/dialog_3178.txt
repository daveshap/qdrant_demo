DAVID: As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section. Nobody gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right?
ELMER: Not in one piece anyway. I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother. I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her. The Vice President here will vouch for that.
DAVID: You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
ELMER: Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie and I'm "Coochie-Coo". I'11 be back in 15."
