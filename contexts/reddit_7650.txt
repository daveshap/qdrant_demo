Initiated a rotation
Hi. I have met with a PI to talk about rotation, and she indicated her lab has spots and she suggested me to talk to some members. I didn't talk to anyone since I really like her work in bioinformatics and I want to start the rotation ASAP. I feel that experiencing the lab by myself being there is more valuable than other people's versions of what they feel. I'm also planning on talking to the lab members once I start the rotation since that PI's lab is pretty far away. I emailed her for starting the rotation, and she said that's alright and asked whether I have talked to some members. How should I respond without sounding not prepared? Thanks.
