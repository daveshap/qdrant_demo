newly purchased and formatted (ext4) seagate external hard drive 5tb cannot store files in Lubuntu 18.10 + almost 40gb used somehow I recently purchased a new external Seagate 5tb drive. I am running Lubuntu 18.10 from an external Sandisk USB drive. I tried to format the 5tb external drive using mkfs.ext4 using the terminal but once i did that, it was not appearing on the file manager sidebar. So I downloaded and used Gparted. Created a GPT partition table and formatted the whole 5tb drive to ext4.Now the drive appears on the file manager sidebar, but when i try to drag and drop a file, from my Lubuntu usb drive to the external seagate 5tb drive, nothing happens. I tried rebooting, and when i try to move/copy the file again, I get this message: Error opening file \u201c/media/h/f0de3be3-77d2-4ef0-95d9-65f6b7ac5451/testfile.jpg\u201d: Permission deniedCould someone please explain how i may get the external hard drive to be useable?  Is it possibly faulty?  Could I have done something that may have damaged it by formatting it. Could it perhaps work if i tried a different variant of ubuntu like xubuntu ?why gparted says that 37.76gb is in use in this new external 5tb drive, and only 4.51tb is available ?  (The drive i bought was from ebay and heavily discounted, however, there appeared to be a seal on the package and everything seems new).thankyou
