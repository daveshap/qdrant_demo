MCCLANE: Smart move. Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.

MCCLANE: Whatever you say...Just answer one question. What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
QUAID: I give up.
MCCLANE: You. You're the same. No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you. Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself. I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an Ego Trip"."
QUAID: I'm not interested in that.
MCCLANE: You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
