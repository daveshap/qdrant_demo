HAL: How will you do our love scenes?
VIKTOR: Body double.
HAL: For her?
VIKTOR: For you. I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale. But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself. She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins. She's on the line now.
VIKTOR: Simone, are you there?
SIMONE: I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
