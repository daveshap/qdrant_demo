I did it!! I left my house for the day and had fun!
Today was a really really good day, I left my house for like 11 hours!!! I got past my anxiety and just smiled through the day. I'm sitting on my couch right now after a long day away from home and I feel so calm and sort of relieved. I feel happy, happy that this day was actually really good. My god I almost never leave my house and when I do my head turns into chaos but today it was just calmness. I'm so so surprised. Most of all I'm proud of myself :D I feel great!!!
