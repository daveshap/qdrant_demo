SEBASTIAN: Oh yes.
KATHRYN: Tell me all the details.
SEBASTIAN: It was... Fantastic.
KATHRYN: Oh come on. For her first time?
SEBASTIAN: I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
KATHRYN: No, tell me.
SEBASTIAN: It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
KATHRYN: Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
SEBASTIAN: Mock, mock, mock.
