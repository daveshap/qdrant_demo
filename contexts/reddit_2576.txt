Did anyone hate your new job after 3 months in?
Probation period is 6 months but 3 months into the job and im hating it. It gives me jitters, i was judged of my performance simply because im too quiet. I was told im not doing much to empower my colleagues. And i realise the job wasnt what i thought to be. It worsens my anxiety and i had to work long hours. What do i tell my prospective employers if i were to go for interviews again?

update: thanks people, i didnt know that my post would attract so much attention. thank u for all the suggestions and encouragement i really appreciate it. has anyone of u tried to look for jobs base on your personality and character and scrutinise the jobscope and role and thinking that u would be suitable for the job u r applying?
