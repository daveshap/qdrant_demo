How can I make Ubuntu recognize RAM? I added RAM to my PC with Ubuntu 18.04 but it does not finish booting the system.I added two memories of 2GB each, before had a module of two cards of 1 Gb each. Check the Acer instructions and the ones you buy are compatible.The notebook is Acer Extensa 5620z Intel Pentium 1.46 GHz 533 MHz2 GB DDR2.It does not give any error, because it would sound the beep, but it does not start the system, it passes the Ubuntu logo as always when loading, but it does not start, it keeps the screen with the ubuntu logo (the word ubuntu and the five red dots underneath).Is there any way to make it recognize the new memory, doing it from the BIOS or in safe boot of Ubuntu?Thank you.Edit:I did more tests and the modules are compatible with the laptop.I explain: I had a module of two pieces of 1 GB each. I put the new module of 2 pieces of 2 Gb each. And it did not start.Now I put one of those that had first 1 GB and one of the new 2 GB, and boots perfectly, recognizing the 2.92 Gb.Which means it works.How can I do to accept both 2 GB?
