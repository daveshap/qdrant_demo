Tax analyses on both Clinton's and Sander's tax plans have been released by the non-partisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. How do you think this will effect the primary and/or general election?
So today the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center released their report on Bernie's tax plan:

The Washington Post highlights that this plan would raise around 15.3 Trillion over the next decade and obviously lead to increase of taxes across the board. The average increase would be around $9000 per household, though that mainly comes from the highest earners in America paying the most with the average increase for the middle class would be around 4700.

Comparing it to Hillary's plan that Urban-Brookings reviewed yesterday, her plan raises a lot less overall at 1.1 trillion over the decade, but has less of an effect on the average american overall compared to Bernie's in taxes. The bottom 95% of taxplayers would see little change, while the top 5% would see large increases, though less overall than in Sanders' plan.

So what do you think of the analysis? Bernie has argued that his tax increases will be offset by what it will pay for, but will voters go for that, especially given how many economists split on his plan. Will they accept Hillary's plan that is less ambitious, but not cost or raise as much money? And how may this effect the general election for either candidate?
