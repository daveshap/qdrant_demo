Two grammar mistakes related to preposition and tenses My Japanese student asked me the following questions. His English level is not that good so I'm wondering about how to give him an answer that will help him understand more easily. 1)If you can say \"on the weekend\" then can you say \u201con next weekend\u201d in \u201cthe seminar is taking place next weekend\u201d? If not then why not? 2)Why do you say \u201cThe seminar is taking place this weekend\u201d instead of \u201cthis seminar has taken place this weekend\u201d? Is \u201cthe staff\u201d the subject if so does that mean \u201cthe staff is taking place this weekend\u201d?I'm not sure about the 1st question myself beside it just not being common to add \"on\" when it comes to adding \"next/last/etc\" in front of the word \"weekend\". As for the second one, \"to be taking place this weekend\" and \"has taken place this weekend\" are obviously different. But I'm not sure how to explain this, specifically when it comes to the subject and the tense. Any help will be deeply appreciated.
