LARIVIERE: Wade, you're done. Let me have the shop keys.
WADE: You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves. Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
LARIVIERE: The key, Wade.
WADE: Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure. Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him. I've got to call my brother.
WADE: I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.
ROLFE: For what?
WADE: To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
ROLFE: Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
CHICK: The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
WADE: Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
CHICK: -- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
WADE: Yeah. I know about that.
CHICK: LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
WADE: Tell me.
CHICK: Chub says you're fired.
WADE: He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
CHICK: He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
