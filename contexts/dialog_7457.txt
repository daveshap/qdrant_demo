DANIEL: Grandma, look at me!
MA STONE: I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
DANIEL: Not me!
MA STONE: Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
MARY: Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
MA STONE: Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
MARY: Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
MA STONE: What's that?
MARY: I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
