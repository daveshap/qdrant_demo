Just a friendly reminder for those of us struggling out there
Don’t forget that YOU’RE THE CATCH!!! You’re an awesome person and you deserve a super awesome mate who values you for you. I know it sucks being rejected but it’s probably not even about you. There’s unlimited valid reasons that it doesn’t work out. Nothing is wrong with you. Maybe take a break to reflect on how awesome you are before the next round. Play the game. Fist bump.

Edit: if some of you are bringing all this negative energy into dating then it seriously might be time to consider taking a break. I hope you’re able to find some qualities you like about yourself, and I promise looks aren’t everything to everyone. Be kind to yourselves.
