EPPS: You know what? I think you got Schwarzkopf. You did! You got the General right in the ass. Now that's good shooting.
JAEGER: Blow me.
EPPS: Another month in this desert and I might just.
WES: Think we're going to do it? Think we're going to war?
EPPS: Not up to us. Up to the Iraqis. All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
JAEGER: We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
WES: I don't think we'll go to war. We shouldn't even be here. This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict. It should be decided regionally.
JAEGER: People are suffering.
WES: People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
