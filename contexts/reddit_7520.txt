Retaking courses online
I'm working on my application to PT school but it looks like I need to retake a few classes. Since covid19 is poppin off, I think I'll only be able to retake courses online. One of the universities I'm applying to recommended Portage learning and I also called Purdue Global and their representative recommended straighterline. They're both accredited but the only problem I'll run into is whether or not graduate school admissions will accept those credits or not. I was wondering if anyone had experience retaking courses through strictly online institutions. What did you use? How much did it cost? Class resources? At your own pace? Thank you!
