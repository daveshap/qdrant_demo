JOE: I would prefer some peanut butter.
COYLE: How would you like that, sir? On some kind of toast?
JOE: Toast? No...just the butter.
COYLE: Right away.
SUSAN: Why do you love peanut butter so much?
JOE: I don't know.
SUSAN: I adore things like that....food I can't do without. Don't you?
JOE: Yes...
SUSAN: It comforts you, doesn't it?
JOE: Yes...I've found that it does.
DREW: Mind if I throw up?
PARRISH: Please, Drew.
JOE: I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
SUSAN: I am, too.
JOE: Has her pain abated?
SUSAN: We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
JOE: I'm sorry to hear that.
DREW: Who are we talking about?
JOE: But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
DREW: Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
JOE: Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
