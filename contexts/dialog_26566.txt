MACKELWAY: Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
DAITZ: Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
MACKELWAY: I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me.
KULOK: Don't be too harsh.
MACKELWAY: I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is. Did he hit on you?
KULOK: Huh?
MACKELWAY: When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
KULOK: Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
MACKELWAY: You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
KULOK: No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
MACKELWAY: Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
KULOK: Because you asked him to, stupid.
MACKELWAY: Oh yeah, I forgot.
KULOK: There are Agency regulations about this.
MACKELWAY: Intra-Agency fraternizing.""
KULOK: It's a no-no.
MACKELWAY: I know.
KULOK: I've been thinking about this.
MACKELWAY: Does Koessler ask about me?
KULOK: He's called a couple times.
MACKELWAY: What did you tell him?
KULOK: Just routine stuff.
MACKELWAY: Not about coming to see Daitz?
KULOK: Not yet. Not about this, either.
