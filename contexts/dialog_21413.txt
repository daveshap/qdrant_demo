EDWARD: I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
VIVIAN: I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
EDWARD: Why not?
VIVIAN: Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you? It works.
EDWARD: Was someone rude to you?
VIVIAN: I had a little problem in one store. I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say. I don't belong there. Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget. She was cool.
EDWARD: Vivian, you belong wherever you are. I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
VIVIAN: Okay.
EDWARD: Good.
VIVIAN: Come with me?
