What careers could I pursue having lost my only job of 10 years due to deterioration in health?
I've (M27) worked as a Lithographic Printer for 10 years, so it's the only work experience I have. It always paid fairly well, earning me around Â£34k annually. I've recently been given a rather delayed diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and temporal arteritis, resulting in the deterioration of my joints and eyesight. Given the nature of the work, I've had to leave my position and it's left me in a professional and financial limbo. I'm looking for advice on pursuing a new career, as any attempts so far have been acknowledged but denied due to my lack of experience in any other field of work. I am open to a short stint of education if it will aid my chances of finding something worthwhile. I'm accepting of the fact that I will be taking a significant wage cut for now, and possibly the foreseeable future, but would be hopeful of finding a position in which I could eventually reach a similar salary to my last due to my outgoings being based around that salary. Thanks in advance for any advice.
