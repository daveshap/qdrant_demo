SIR ROBERT: She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
WESSEX: My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
SIR ROBERT: She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
WESSEX: Is she obedient?
SIR ROBERT: As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
WESSEX: I like her.
