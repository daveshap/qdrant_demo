JOHN: Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
PAUL: Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon. Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
RINGO: Me? Why?
GEORGE: Bag-snatcher.
GRANDFATHER: That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
JOHN: Every morning.
JOHN: Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny... 'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial. Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
PAUL: Like what?
JOHN: Well, I've got me gob stopper. Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
NORM: Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
JOHN: Please, can I have one to surge with?
NORM: No.
JOHN: Ah, go on, you swine.
NORM: No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
