In light of Lebron James' announcement to support Clinton - What historical effect have high profile celebrities/athletes had on polling/voting in their respective state?
So as I'm sure quite a few of us have seen today, [Lebron James announced his endorsement of Hillary Clinton today](http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/02/politics/lebron-james-endorses-hillary-clinton/), and with [Ohio being tabbed as a swing state by fivethirtyeight.com](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo), I think it'd be interesting to know if this has any chance to swing polling at all.
