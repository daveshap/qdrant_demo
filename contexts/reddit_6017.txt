Should i go in to office today- under the weather
There’s only a few of us in the office. Woke up today with a bad headache, stuffy nose, and my asthma is acting up.

I’ve only been at my job two months and don’t wanna get in any trouble. 

*im headed to office now. I usually check in with my boss when i arrive, via Skype
