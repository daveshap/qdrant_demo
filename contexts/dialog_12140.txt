HAROLD: Mhravitch. Remember that name.
PAUL: Mhravitch.
HAROLD: The name will live forever. It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia. Mhravitch.
PAUL: When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
HAROLD: It's rather a disappointment these days. It isn't there any more.
PAUL: Sir?
HAROLD: The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia. To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout. Play lots of contact sports?
PAUL: I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
HAROLD: You're supposed to get hurt!
PAUL: Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football. He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
HAROLD: Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
PAUL: They're not engaged.
HAROLD: He seems to think they are. He told me that were.
PAUL: Oh no, no, no, no, no. It can't be. How embarrassing.
HAROLD: You're a very good boy to respond that way.
PAUL: No, no, no, no, no.
HAROLD: I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
PAUL: Go ahead. No, no, no, no.
PAUL: Thank God!
SHUTTLE: What a relief!
