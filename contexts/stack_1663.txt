Do poles enhance frequency or cause it to dip I'm a bit confused about the idea of poles. In some of my courses such as digital signal processing, we are taught that in filter design, you place a pole at a frequency you want to enhance and a zero where you want to cause a dip.In other courses in which we deal with Bode plots, I notice that a pole causes a -20dB/decade slope decrease?Why is there an incosistency?
