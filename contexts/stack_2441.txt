Displaying addresses (point) relative to quantity at address using ArcGIS Desktop? I just geocoded 40,000 plus addresses. However there are several addresses that have 100's of people living at a given address (ex. apartment building). How do I show larger values as larger symbols using ArcGIS Desktop 10.2?
