FORD: Jazz, we're talking here.
GRENDEL: Go on, another time, another place.
FORD: Why did you interrupt? Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
JAZZ: Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
FORD: How'd you get this from her?
JAZZ: You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
FORD: A fucking C.D. Wow, this case is closed. So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
JAZZ: No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in? I mean, she is what this case is about.
FORD: I wish I knew. You did good work...
JAZZ: Make eye contact when you say that.
FORD: I'm sorry, that dress. What do you say we...
JAZZ: Celebrate? Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders? Forget it, man.
