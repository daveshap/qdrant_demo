things anxiety has taken from me
* Good memories - I struggle to remember the nice and the fun things. My personal highlight reel is all the times that I did something embarrassing, awkward or badly
* Ability to make decisions - I can't even plan my day without questioning everything. Should I do something more environmentally-friendly? Should I invite a friend, and would they even say yes? Do I have chores to do instead? Do I deserve this? 
* Ability to think clearly - I feel like I live in a fog of questioning everything and feeling sad and cut-off. I don't know what is normal any more. 
* Self-confidence - I went to Paris at 18 and China aged 20 where I didn't know anyone. This weekend I haven't been to the music festival at the end of my street because I think it will stress me out too much. 
* Zest for life - I used to plan the things I wanted to do and see, and I'd go travelling at every opportunity. Now I'd be quite happy if I could just get through the week without panicking and/or hating myself.

Sharing to get this out of my system and hope someone else understands.
