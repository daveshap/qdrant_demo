JACKIE: What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
STARKS: [Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
JACKIE: If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
STARKS: Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
JACKIE: What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
STARKS: No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
JACKIE: Well, you belong in one.
JACKIE: Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
STARKS: I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
JACKIE: You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
STARKS: [Beat] What?
JACKIE: William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
STARKS: [Beat] What?
JACKIE: His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
JACKIE: I looked it up.
STARKS: How?
STARKS: I gave you my dog tags.
JACKIE: No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
STARKS: How'd he die?
JACKIE: I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
JACKIE: I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
STARKS: It's December 25th, 1993 today.
JACKIE: No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004.
JACKIE: I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
STARKS: I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
JACKIE: Please...
