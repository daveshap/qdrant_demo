DUDE: Hiya Allan.
ALLAN: Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted. I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
DUDE: Sure Allan, I'll be there.
ALLAN: Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
DUDE: Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
ALLAN: Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
DUDE: Yeah, okay.
