What happened to the K-Tron in the command center? Towards the end of Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets we see Commander Ar\u00fcn Filitt's K-Tron robots split into two groups.  One group is with the soldiers deep down in the space station, while the other group is standing just outside the command center.<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   At the crucial moment, based on orders from Commander Filitt, both groups of K-Tron start shooting up the humans.  At both locations the soldiers seem incapable of defending themselves from the K-Tron.<br><br>  It is only deep in the station at the Pearl's lair that the K-Tron are destroyed - by Val\u00e9rian.  Only his pistol has the fire power to destroy the K-Tron (which raises other questions - how come Val\u00e9rian's pistol conveniently packs such a punch, and how come he shoots so well?)<br><br>But there doesn't seem to be an equivalent of Val\u00e9rian at the command center, yet at some point in time the shooting by K-Tron stops.</blockquote>So what happed to the group of K-Tron at the command center?
