IRIS: Why? Who are you?
TRAVIS: I drive a taxi. You tried to get away one night. Remember?
IRIS: No.
TRAVIS: You tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't let you.
IRIS: I don't remember.
TRAVIS: It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here.
IRIS: We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
TRAVIS: I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
IRIS: You want to make it like this?
TRAVIS: Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
IRIS: Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
TRAVIS: But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
IRIS: I musta been stoned.
TRAVIS: Do they drug you?
IRIS: Oh, come off it, man.
TRAVIS: Listen...
IRIS: Don't you want to make it? Can't you make it?
