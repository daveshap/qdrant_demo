Is it normal to be stressed before my first day on the job?
On Friday I got a call from the temp agency I’m employed from that they had a job for me. Its a warehouse job where I’m racking parts (thats what they told me?). I’m getting really bad anxiety about my new job and I want to crawl in a hole and die. Any advice?
