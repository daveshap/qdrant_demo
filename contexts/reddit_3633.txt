Crossed state lines for a date- stood up and ghosted.
So last week I (M29)  started talking with a woman (23) on a dating app. She asked me if I was going to take her out for dinner sometime soon and since I had been trying  to get myself back into dating after a failed, 3 year engagement which ended in January, I jumped at the chance. 

We had talked for the whole week (video and voice calls), added each other on snap, traded numbers,  and made plans. 

Today I woke up early to work for 8 hours so I could leave at 2pm for the four hour drive to where she is. We had correspondence the whole way and she sent me an address to pick her up at. When I got to her neck  of the woods she said her mom stopped by and asked me to wait fifteen minutes before going to her place. I parked at a shopping block and picked up a bouquet. 45 minutes later she said I could come pick her up. 

While I found the neighborhood she gave me, I couldn't find the house number she specified so I tried to text, then call her. She didnt respond or answer. After driving in circles around the neighborhood for an hour and some change I decided to get a hotel room. As I write this post I am sitting in a Days Inn with the flowers I got her. 

I could have stayed home, ordered a pizza and watched The Witcher...this had been my plan since knowing its release date until she and I had connected. 

Anyways. Happy Holiday season to all of you.
