OLD SALIERI: Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
VOGLER: You cannot say that!
OLD SALIERI: No? Was Mozart a good man?
VOGLER: God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
OLD SALIERI: All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him!
VOGLER: My son, no one can speak for God.
OLD SALIERI: Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
VOGLER: I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
OLD SALIERI: Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers! There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
