What the hell do you do when they get their guitar out?
This might sound like a niche question but I'm guessing I'm not the only person this has happened to. I was on a date recently and ended up back at the guy's house, whereupon he (unprompted) got out his guitar and started strumming his heart out to Elliott Smith's back catalogue. My question is very simple - what, as the (involuntary) audience are you supposed to do in that situation? Gaze at them adoringly? Try and join in? Bosh out some impromptu interpretive dance moves? Genuinely, what is the appropriate response? (I'd like to add that, whilst I absolutely do not want to be sexist here, I feel like the ladies may relate to this more than the fellas. Happy to be proved wrong though, obviously)
