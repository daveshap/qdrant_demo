RICKY: This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
BOBBY: I don't know.
RICKY: Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
BOBBY: Missing what? He didn't say shit.
RICKY: Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
BOBBY: What did I 'get?'
RICKY: Yeah. What vibe?
BOBBY: I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
RICKY: Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
BOBBY: What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
JIMMY: Spa?
BOBBY: Yeah.
JIMMY: Depends what night.
RICKY: A lot of Persians?
JIMMY: Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
BOBBY: 'Trustafarians?'
JIMMY: You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
RICKY: I call 'em wiggers.
JIMMY: Different.
BOBBY: This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
JIMMY: Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
BOBBY: Yeah?
JIMMY: Understand me?
BOBBY: Yeah.
RICKY: So is this the drop?
BOBBY: Like I said, I don't know.
RICKY: He woulda told us right?
BOBBY: You would think.
RICKY: Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man. Hey, bro.
DOORMAN: The line's over there.
RICKY: Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
DOORMAN: How is it you're good? You on a list?
RICKY: Yeah. Ricky Slade.
DOORMAN: You see a Ricky Slade?
RICKY: Cardiff Giant?
DOORMAN: What?
RICKY: Cardiff Giant. Just check.
DOORMAN: Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
RICKY: Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
DOORMAN: Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
BOBBY: We're with Ruiz.
DOORMAN: Ruiz isn't here.
BOBBY: We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
DOORMAN: Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
BOBBY: Can you check?
DOORMAN: He's not here.
DOORMAN: What's up, man.
SCREECH: S'up.
DOORMAN: You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
SCREECH: A little.
DOORMAN: You look good, man.
SCREECH: Cool. See you later.
DOORMAN: Cool.
RICKY: Did you see that shit? Motherfucker. You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
DOORMAN: He's on the list.
RICKY: Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
