ULLA: Min Bialystock.
BIALYSTOCK: Nice girl.
BLOOM: Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending. I mean these offices and everything.
BIALYSTOCK: Why? Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
BLOOM: But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back. It would look better in court.
BIALYSTOCK: Stop talking like that, you white mouse! Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
BLOOM: Roger De Bris. Roger De Bris. Oh yes, the director. Is he good... I mean bad?
BIALYSTOCK: Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
BLOOM: Do you think he'll take the job?
BIALYSTOCK: Only if we ask him.
BIALYSTOCK: Come on. We'd better hurry. We're late.
BIALYSTOCK: Call chauffeur. Get car.
ULLA: Good. Good. We go Motel.
BIALYSTOCK: No. We go.
ULLA: You, Blum go Motel.
BIALYSTOCK: No. No Motel. Get car. Get car.
ULLA: Get car. Get car.
BIALYSTOCK: Very nice girl.
