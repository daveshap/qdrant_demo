JEROME: Call German.
EUGENE: Any particular reason?
JEROME: We can't stay here.
EUGENE: What are you talking about?
JEROME: They think I offed the Director.
EUGENE: What makes them think that?
JEROME: They found my eyelash.
EUGENE: Where?
JEROME: In a corridor.
EUGENE: Could be worse. They could have found it in your eye.
JEROME: Come on--we're taking off.
EUGENE: I'm not going anywhere. Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
JEROME: --You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again. We should cut our losses.
EUGENE: Where is your head, Jerome? You're acting like a guilty man. They won't marry the eyelash to you. They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
JEROME: They'll recognize me.
EUGENE: How could they recognize you? <i>I</i> don't recognize you. Anyway, you don't have a choice. You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now. No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing. This is a minor inconvenience is all it is. We've taken worse heat than this. Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered. You can't quit on me now. I've put too much into this. Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>. I had other offers, you know. I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine. You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself? We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
EUGENE: And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. How could you be so careless?
JEROME: I'm sorry. I think I was crying.
