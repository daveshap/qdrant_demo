GRIERSON: I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that you do not.
DAVID: VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
GRIERSON: Of course.
DAVID: And a car.
GRIERSON: Mmmmm...
DAVID: Maybe two cars.
GRIERSON: A car sounds sensible.
DAVID: And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family. Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up.
