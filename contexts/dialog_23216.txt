SOMERSET: All day Saturday, and all day Sunday. The murderer would want Gould to take his time. To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut? There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?

SOMERSET: This is just to satisfy my curiosity. I'm still leaving town Saturday.

SOMERSET: And, if it's a threat.
MILLS: We put her in a safe house.
