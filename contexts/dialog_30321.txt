MADELEINE: Oh! Yes. Hello.
SCOTTIE: Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
MADELEINE: I... suddenly felt such a fool.
SCOTTIE: I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
MADELEINE: Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects. But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it? What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind... It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
SCOTTIE: You've nothing to apologize for.
MADELEINE: Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
SCOTTIE: Not at all, I enjoyed --
SCOTTIE: -- talking to you...
MADELEINE: I enjoyed talking to you.
