BEANY: I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
CONNELL: Where is she?
BEANY: Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
CONNELL: Did you find her?
BEANY: No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
CONNELL: Go out and find her!
BEANY: Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
CONNELL: Hello! . . . Yeh?
BEANY: Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
