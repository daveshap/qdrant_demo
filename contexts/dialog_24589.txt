JERRY: Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics - The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive. Did we forget anything?
JOE: There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
JERRY: Sugar?
JOE: Get me Room 414.
JERRY: What do you think you're doing?
JERRY: Telephone call? Who's got time for that?
JOE: We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
JERRY: Since when? Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
JOE: That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
JERRY: Drop her a postcard. Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
JOE: Hello, Room 414? This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
