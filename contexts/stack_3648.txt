What is the impact of leaving disabled root key on AWS instance? I have a user which, when asked to create an IAM root user account, left the now disabled root key on the instance.When asked to remove the root key, he said it's disabled now so what's the difference.I don't want to get into a argument with this guy but was wondering if the community had any cogent thoughts about the impact of leaving a root key on the system when it's disabled?Thanks!
