I tried to kill myself Friday
I took as many pills as I could and washed them down with whiskey. Then I took a razor blade to my arm and cut it up until my arm and my basement was covered in blood. My parents found me and now I am at their house while they try to get me help. I survived and now I’m looking ahead to the future. I must’ve survived for a reason. It’s going to be hard but I need to at least give this a chance. I hope all of you do as well. Take care.
