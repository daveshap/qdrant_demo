SANDY: So, what's next?
JEFFREY: Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
SANDY: I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
JEFFREY: You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
SANDY: Yes. I do.
JEFFREY: Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
SANDY: You really want to do this, don't you?
JEFFREY: I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
SANDY: I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
JEFFREY: First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
SANDY: I already know. The Slow Club". It's on Route 7."
JEFFREY: Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
SANDY: Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
JEFFREY: Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
