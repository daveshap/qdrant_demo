Managers - How To Keep an Outstanding Employee?
I'm kind of at a rock and a hard place on this one. I have an employee that is a go-getter, very skilled, and willing to learn new things on the fly. The problem is I think she isn't paid enough. I've brought it up with my boss but I keep getting told that my employee has only been here for two years so no bump in pay. I showed data that suggests otherwise but to no avail. I think my employee enjoys everything she does and the people around her. We have a very good working relationship too. After her review, I got the sense that she is figuring out she can make more elsewhere.

Anybody dealt with this before?
