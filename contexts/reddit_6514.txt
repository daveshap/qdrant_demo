How can I politely but firmly ask my supervisor for my shifts back?
I  got hired for this security job back in January. I go to school Monday  and Wednesday. They were able to work with my schedule and give me  shifts on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. I love it bc I sit at a lobby  desk, not a lot happens so I can study which is great. As of about a  month ago, it appears they hired too many people and so my Tuesday day  was cut. To make it more irritating, the guy who my shifts were given to  showed up an hour late one day and one supervisor said he has been a  headache but for some reason he still gets my shifts? So I emailed the  senior supervisor saying my usual schedule of Tuesday, Thursday and  Friday was working really well with my school schedule and I asked if  there was any way I could keep doing that schedule. He replied saying we  are finally fully staffed and that the only days he can guarantee me  are Thursday and Friday. On Friday I replied back to him asking "Is  there a particular reason I am being kicked off this Tuesday shift?"  followed with "I don't understand why someone new appears to have gotten  precedence for this shift over me". It looks like he heeded my  frustration because Monday around noon I get a text from them saying  they have scheduled me for my usual shift on Tuesday. Awesome I thought -  But when I got to the site and looked at the schedule, sure enough  "headache" guy was given my usual shift for the following week. I'm  kinda pissed off about it. I plan to email him again about it tomorrow.  Something along the lines of:

"Hi  supervisor, I appreciate you putting my back on x site for Tuesday.  However I noticed I wasn't on it for next week. I have been doing a good  job at this shift/site for the past 6 months. Am I to understand that  this new guy gets to show up, take my shift, while I'm supposed to just  roll over and be ok with it? Because I'm really not..."

Good or too much?
