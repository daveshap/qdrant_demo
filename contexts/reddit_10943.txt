Why is there no euthanasia for depressed people?
It seems crazy to me that you can’t opt for assisted suicide if you’re depressed.
Even if there was a mandatory period of therapy or anti depressants etc before.
At one point there’s just little that seems worth trying, and it doesn’t seem fair to try and force people to live.

Life is just shitty for some of us.

I get that the idea is a suicidal person could always get better, but then lots of people don’t recover. And lots of people then have to take it into their own hands.

Sure there’s a lucky few who achieve a peaceful death.

But then what about everyone who spends their final moments suffering, or those who are permanently damaged from botched suicide attempts?

I think the most peaceful method of death in my country would have to be gas. But then one simple mistake and you’re brain damaged for the rest of your life. Incapable of doing anything to take control of your life anymore.

It’s 2019. WHERE IS MY SUICIDE BOOTH??
