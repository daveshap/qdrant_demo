What are Donald Trump's views on LGBT rights?
In the wake of the election I've seen conflicting things on Reddit and social media about Donald Trump's views on the LGBT community.

This is the only article I've read on his stance:

Can anyone provide some more sources on Trump's views and stances on LGBT rights?
