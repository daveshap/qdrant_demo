At your school, do Student Club Advisors have to be faculty?
Hi! I'm curious to find out if some schools restrict student club advisors to only faculty. I work in institutional research and am interested in engaging more with our student pop, so I'd like to be a club advisor on the side. I believe my school allows administrative staff to act as advisors, but I'm not totally sure. It doesn't seem like a common thing. What's your observation?
