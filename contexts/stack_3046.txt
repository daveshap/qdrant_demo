Current in infinitely long wire? Theoretically, suppose an infinite-length wire with completely no resistance (0\u03a9) connected to the terminals of a battery, and an electric lamp placed in the \"center\" of said wire. The question is: would the lamp glow? i.e. will there be current?I, alongside my IBY1 physics peers predicated that: although there will be a potential difference across both terminals, the electrons gaining energy when leaving the battery will never be able to transfer this energy to the last few electrons in the wire.Assuming the bulb will glow on the instant the battery is connected raises the issue that energy can be transferred at infinite speed. I would be appreciative if this issue could be cleared up.
