Best way to get into a new companies rhythm/speed
So this is for sure a very good problem to have.

I recently started at a new company and they are still in the startup phase. I have experience starting at 3000+ then going down to  500+ employees and now I'm coming in here to a space of only 38. Its weird because they're pacing is a lot... slower than I'm used to. In both of those larger spaces I had the same leader who was a workaholic (work on average 12+ hour days and weekends and would say they were all about work/life balance but would freak if you left at your scheduled time) and I guess I'm just use to juggling several projects at once and always being stressed.

Here projects span out over a lot longer than I'm used to. A project I could finish in a few days through crunching at the larger companies aren't expected to be done until a week or two out. I finish a project then sit here with this extra time and it freaks me out. What are some good ways to get used to this? So far they love me but at the same time I don't want to start doing too much and burn out even when that's not the expectation.
