PAUL: I have to pee. If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
AUGGIE: You got it.
WAITER: What'll it be, Auggie?
AUGGIE: Uh... My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
WAITER: And what about for you?
AUGGIE: Huh?
WAITER: What about for you?
AUGGIE: For me? I'll have the same thing.
WAITER: Do me a favor, will you?
AUGGIE: What's that, Sol?
WAITER: Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales
AUGGIE: What's the difference?
WAITER: It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
AUGGIE: Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, One corned beef sandwich
WAITER: Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
PAUL: So. Are we ready?
AUGGIE: Ready. Any time you are.
PAUL: I'm all ears.
AUGGIE: Okay. You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
PAUL: Every word.
AUGGIE: Okay. So this is the story of how it happened. Okay. It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial. A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
