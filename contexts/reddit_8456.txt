What evidence exists around the idea that high-income earners are likely to move to avoid higher taxes?
One of the biggest news stories in the UK currently is the leak/release of Labour's manifesto for the 2017 general election, which you can find through here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39877439

Many of these proposals - such as re-nationalising the railways, spending £8bn pounds on social care, building 100,000 new homes - will be expensive. Labour say they will be able to pay for its policies by increasing taxes on the rich, for example 'increasing income tax for the highest-earning 5% to raise an extra £6bn for the NHS'.

While Labour have rejected this, this current manifesto has been compared to their previous pledges in the 1970s and 80s, especially the 1983 manifesto: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39872189. Those policies remain controversial today - the high income tax-rates of 1970s Britain under Labour (83% on the richest earners) even caused Rod Stewart to move to L.A. and name an album about it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Crossing

Granted, this is just one case of a very rich guy packing up because he's being taxed quite highly. But there are numerous studies that support both sides of the argument: that rich people do leave - in significant enough numbers - when a high tax-rate is introduced, or that rich people don't leave - in significant enough numbers - when one is introduced (have put links at the bottom).

So...

- Which side is generally supported by economists?
- If it exists, has the frequency of 'rich migration' varied over time?
- And do the benefits of higher taxes outweigh the impact of those high earners leaving?

*Note: if it helps for the argument, this can be related to taxes over than income-tax. Capital gains, property, inheritance etc., but income-tax is the main one I'm focused on atleast. Also, this is mainly concerned with the West/US and UK, but with the nature of globalisation today I can understand how practically all countries' tax-rates may link into it.*
