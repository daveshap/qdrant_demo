CHARLIE: Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
WESLEY: You told me how to do it!
CHARLIE: That was to get him to talk! Get rid of that thing, will you?
CHARLIE: This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
WESLEY: He told us it's in the Buick.
CHARLIE: We don't know which Buick, do we?
WESLEY: Well, why'd you shoot him?
CHARLIE: I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
