HELEN: When are you going to be home?
KENNY: I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
HELEN: What's happened?
KENNY: Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
HELEN: What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
KENNY: I'll be evacuated with the President.
