JOHN: Where did you go when you left here?
ANN: I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
JOHN: Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!! Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
ANN: No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
JOHN: You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
ANN: I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
