DAY-DAY: Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited. But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired. You feel me?
ROACH: I feel you. I've just been practicing that one move all week. I thought that was it.
CUSTOMER #1: I can't get jiggy with this shit. Where is the damn manager?
DAY-DAY: Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment. I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
CUSTOMER #1: No, give me my damn money back. Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
DAY-DAY: Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
CUSTOMER #1: I don't have no damn cover.
DAY-DAY: I can't give you your damn money back on this.
CUSTOMER #1: Bullshit! I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
DAY-DAY: Well, you gonna have to go postal then.
