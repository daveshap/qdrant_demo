KNIGHT: I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
INDY: Who are you?
KNIGHT: The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
INDY: That was seven hundred years ago.
KNIGHT: A long time to wait.
KNIGHT: You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
INDY: I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
KNIGHT: I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
