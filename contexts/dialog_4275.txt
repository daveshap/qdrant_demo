CARDENAS: Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
ESTER: Yes.
CARDENAS: Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
ESTER: Like cats and dogs.
CARDENAS: What did they argue about?
ESTER: You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
CARDENAS: Did they argue the day before he died?
ESTER: Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
CARDENAS: What was the nature of the argument?
ESTER: Sex.
CARDENAS: Could you be more specific?
