There seems to be a echo chamber of negativity, defeatism, and general antagonism on this sub. I (30M) thought I'd drop in some positivism, from someone who once came from that same dark place.
Hey guys,

I've been perusing this sub on and off for years, as I've attempted to float in and out of the dating games for past decade. 

As I've mentioned in the title of this post; there are so many submissions that are consumed by negativity: "I'm giving up!", "There's no one out there for me?", "Why even bother?", "Women/Men are so "X"". These are common statements you'll see creep up pretty much daily. And as someone who came from that head space, I GET IT! For the past 10 years of my life, I gave it an honest effort to try and get into the dating game. I was a nerdy, socially awkward, introverted, person. Years of flirting, unsuccessful attempts in asking someone out and getting shot down... by the end of it all, I was jaded, defeated, and honestly thought, "Fuck it why bother, this is bullshit". I remember in University, one of the strategies I used to try and help me get used to rejection, was if I randomly saw a cute girl, I'd politely approach them, and say something like, "Hey, sorry to bother you, but I just had to ask, would you be interested in grabbing coffee or tea with me sometime?". I think I asked something like 20-30 random girls, and I got shot down almost every single time. I remember downloading Tinder, and Bumble, and trying that out; I seemed to make 0 progress no matter how *"hard"* I tried, so as you can imagine, by the time I was getting into my late 20's, I fell into that same dark place.


But here's the thing guys, when has there ever been **ANYTHING** in this world that was actually **WORTH** something, not required some hardship, and effort?


I took a couple years and forgot about dating, forgot about the negativity it brought forth into my life, into my defeatist attitude, and I focused on what made me happy. I got into the best shape I had ever been with regular exercise and a good diet, I played the video games I enjoyed with friends, and had a blast doing it! I decided to join a sports league at my local gym, something a bit out of my comfort zone, but something I had always wanted to try, I saved up some money and traveled solo. I can genuinely say, the past few years of my life, I woke up every single day happy. It's so easy to get lost in the echo chamber of negativity when it comes to dating, and that does nothing good for you, but spread that negativity into your life, and as a result it can absolutely effect that which you're working so hard towards. As humans, we have a natural desire for intimacy, social interaction, to be loved, and to love, so it's natural to focus on it. But when it begins to consume you, it WILL become a problem.


You know the typical response, *"focus on your own self-improvement, and dating will happen!"*


It took me years to realize this, but the reason isn't because a Man or Woman will randomly fall into your lap the more you focus on yourself, and your own improvement. It's because everyone can sense negativity, and positivity. If you are honestly, and truly satisfied and happy with your own state of being, EVERYONE around you can see it, and sense it. Likewise, when you're drowning in desperation, negativity, and defeatism, everyone around can tell. And that absolutely effects your dating life. Would you want to be involved with someone, whose sole purpose of happiness is based off singular need to be with someone? Who otherwise is not happy with their life, and spreads negativity throughout themselves and others? My guess is probably not.


I literally did nothing but spiral downwards and spin in place for over a decade before I realized this wasn't helping me, or anyone else. I focused on me, improving myself, learning new things, enjoying what millions of things life had to offer. Now, at 30 years old, when I attempted to get back into dating, guess what happened? I met someone. She's beautiful, smart, funny, when she laughs... I completely melt. I didn't try to change who I was, I still do the same nerdy things I did before, but I made sure to focus on my life, and really, truly become happy. And not only did it totally change my perspective on dating, but I can honestly say I felt complete... And now I have someone to share that happiness with. 


I know there are some of you who are older than me, and some of you who are younger, some which have had better luck at dating, and some with worse. But I guess the moral of this post is:


**TL;DR:** Don't get lost in negativity, don't give up, truly seek happiness and self-improvement, and others will want to share and enjoy that positivity with you. This life has so much to offer us, and dating is such a small part of it. Spread happiness and positivity to those around you <3. If it can happen for a dorky, reclusive, introvert like myself, it can sure as shit happen for you, but it takes work! I hope you all have great day, and good luck out there <3!
