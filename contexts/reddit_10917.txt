No throwaway account. It's me. I need help. The suicide hotline has been useless.
I owe thousands of dollars.
I have been stabbed in the back by yet another person, worked fifty+ hours and got paid nothing and now I'm going to screw my best friend with no rent payment this month, or money for anything else.
But who gives a shit about money. Sure, I made a mistake working two months for no pay with someone else and am now screwed. (Different than above) Sure, the person I trusted most as a friend I just found out has been ripping me behind my back because she thinks I'm in love with her. 

The person I AM in love with, my ex-wife, has moved on, despite the fact that she promised a second chance after I took some time to fix myself and my problems. 

I have no job. No one. My family is utterly miserable and just judges everything that I do. I am 28 and cannot even afford the healthcare I need to take care of my MS, my collapsed ankles and my ADD which keeps me from focusing on anything. My hand is shaking like mad and I'm doing what I can to avoid painkillers.

I know it's completely stupid, but I find it hard to believe I'll ever find anyone who will love me as much as the two people I've screwed over. I'm out of options and pretty sure I'm at my limits.

I never went to Europe, never even went to the East Coast. If I believed in reincarnation or religion, I'd probably not be as worried, but at this point, I've got nothing left.

The suicide hotline was useless, my therapist is an idiot and I can't afford her anymore anyways, my friends are clueless and I'm out of options. Reddit is my last hope to maybe find someone to help me out. 

I just can't seem to find a reason for myself, yeah I know I'm insanely selfish, but I just can't seem to find a reason to stay here.
