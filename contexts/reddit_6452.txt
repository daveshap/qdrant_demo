Do other people in corporate America not do anything?
I work for a large company. I believe that at the corporate level everyone makes really (in most cases REALLY) good money. But it always seems like many people arent doing much. Just kind of finding ways to get through the day. There are some days I do absolutely nothing. There are some days where I'm on a lot of calls but I'm not doing much. Lots of layers to get through and it makes a simple process change take months to go through. Is this unique or is this pretty much everyone else in corporate gigs? I have some friends say their jobs are the same, but not sure if that's anecdotal or prevalent.
