12V potentiometer I am trying to control the power of a vacuum pump using a 10k potentiometer with 12v as its input source. I've tried wiring it (with the know facing you)with the first lead as ground, second one being the output of the pot and the last one being the 12v input but when I go to measure the voltage of the output it reads 0 volts, is there a different way I need to wire this, I've tried on 2 individual pots so I doubt it is a defect.
