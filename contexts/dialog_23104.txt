SIDNEY: Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
DEWEY: They thought it was a publicity stunt.
SIDNEY: Oh my God. How could it happen?
DEWEY: They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
SIDNEY: It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
DEWEY: As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
SIDNEY: Yeah, right.
DEWEY: Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
SIDNEY: No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
