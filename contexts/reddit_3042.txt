Has anyone moved on from a career you wanted really badly because nothing ever worked out no matter what you tried?
I chose a career in the medical field because I truly love studying the human body and wellness. Problem is I’ve been so miserable that after completing school and failing to get a job in my sector I turned to research in a corporate setting. I’m treated very well at my current job and I get just about everything I ever want but could not get from healthcare (respect, opportunity for advancement, and mentorship). Honestly I could not handle the bullying and I broke down at the end of my schooling but managed to graduate on time. Has anyone experienced this? How did you continue trying or just move on?

*If I could get in to my field my earning power would go up drastically and I could work for myself after a few years of learning everything. I acknowledge that I would probably be miserable but at least I could do want I want after a while.
*At this point I’ve don’t two years of clinical research at two different universities and neither wanted me or advocated for me. In contrast I started my current position in August and I’ve already received a raise and bonus, pay for private leadership coaching, and they’re going bananas because I’m willing to learn how to model/code their health related data.
