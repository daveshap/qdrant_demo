ELAINE: Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
HELEN: He won't take us. Don't you want us around?
ELAINE: Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
HELEN: If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
ELAINE: It isn't that --
HELEN: Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
ELAINE: But I want to stay.
HELEN: Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself. Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
ELAINE: I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
HELEN: Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
ELAINE: Stop it -- stop it.
HELEN: Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
ELAINE: Go away -- please.
HELEN: That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
ELAINE: She mustn't -- don't you let her --
HELEN: There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
ELAINE: If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
