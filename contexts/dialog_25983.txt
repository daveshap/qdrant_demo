JACKIE: See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity. For some <u>real</u> growth.
RACHEL: Oh please.
JACKIE: Shut the fuck up. <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
JACKIE: Doing the <u>right</u> thing. Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside. Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
RACHEL: She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
JACKIE: Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl. They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.
JACKIE: And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this. And remember how good it felt. How easy it was.
RACHEL: And she'll fight back again. God help me, what have I done.
JACKIE: You've turned her into you. And I may not get another chance. To turn her back.
RACHEL: <u>That's</u> what it is. And that's <u>all</u> it is.
