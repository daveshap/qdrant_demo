Who should police college campuses?
In reference to University of Cincinnati - Joe Deters, the Hamilton County prosecutor said "I don't think a university should be in the policing business,"  saying he thinks the city should handle it.  This is an interesting [article on VOX] (http://www.vox.com/2015/7/29/9069841/university-of-cincinnati-police), but I think it would be a bad idea.
