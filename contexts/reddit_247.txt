I don’t know how to ask my girlfriend if I can kiss her
So I’m a bisexual female and I’ve known my girlfriend (let’s call her Rachel) since we were in Nursery (that’s what we call preschool in Scotland) and me and her started dating a little over a week ago, I’ll start with how we got together. So I’m in a WhatsApp group chat with me, Rachel and our 2 other friends (I’ll call them Ellen and Jessi) and Ellen is also bisexual so I renamed the group chat as a joke to “Bisexuh0es” and then Rachel changed it to “Bisexuh0es and Jessi” and I said 

“wait? Rachel are you bi?” 

And she said

“Yeah I am”

And then I said without thinking

“Wow I used to have a crush on you but I thought you were straight” 

And she was like “I had a crush on you too” 

So then I messaged we privately after that and asked her to be my girlfriend and such etc etc. So this was on the 16/1/20 and we had a school trip on the 19th-23rd and we were sharing a room with our friends throughout the trip and we were hugging in the rooms and holding hands and such and yeah 😂☺️. I know that the relationship is moving quite fast but, it’s been fine that way so far and I kind of want to kiss her (that sounds so weird but) and I don’t know how to go about doing it I mean with Valentines Day coming up I might do it then but I’m just nervous on what to say. Can anyone help me with this?
