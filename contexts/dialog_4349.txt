ROBERT: I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
FRANCESCA: Long day. Go to sleep.
ROBERT: Am I too heavy for you?
FRANCESCA: No.
FRANCESCA: Sleep all right?
ROBERT: Yes, thanks.
FRANCESCA: Good. More coffee? Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
ROBERT: What?
FRANCESCA: Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
ROBERT: I... What do you want?
FRANCESCA: Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
ROBERT: Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
FRANCESCA: Well, what is this?
ROBERT: Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
FRANCESCA: To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
ROBERT: I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
FRANCESCA: Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand. Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
ROBERT: What are you doing?
FRANCESCA: Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
ROBERT: How do you know what I experience?
FRANCESCA: I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't need" meaning - "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death."
ROBERT: Stop it!
FRANCESCA: You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
ROBERT: What do you want me to say?
FRANCESCA: I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
ROBERT: STOP IT!
FRANCESCA: Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
ROBERT: I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
FRANCESCA: No one's asking you to!
ROBERT: I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
FRANCESCA: You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
ROBERT: I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
FRANCESCA: WHY?
ROBERT: BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
FRANCESCA: WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
ROBERT: If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
FRANCESCA: What makes it different, Robert?
