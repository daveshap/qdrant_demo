I just realized that I must really like this guy
Not officially dating yet.... but I just realized tonight that I must seriously care and love this guy I have been talking to. I made a small batch of Homemade Mac and Cheese last weekend and he loved it. I told him I would make a bigger batch this weekend for him. I am normally asleep right now.... I just finished making the Mac and Cheese for later today. He likes my College-student cooking (Minimal cooking) so I guess that is good. 

Small little post about that so yeah. I guess a way to a man's heart in some cases is with food.
