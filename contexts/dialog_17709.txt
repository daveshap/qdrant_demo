CROCKETT: So where's the best place for mojitas?
ISABELLA: Bodeguita del Medio. It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
CROCKETT: Where's that?
ISABELLA: Off a little alley with cobblestones. Hemingway went there...
CROCKETT: The Keys?
ISABELLA: Havana.
CROCKETT: Havana? Cubans don't like us or my business...
ISABELLA: Are you afraid? Good. And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
