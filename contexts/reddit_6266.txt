Got an offer and now crickets....
Hey all. I recently received a job offer and accepted. They required a background and drug test before officially hiring. Well it’s been almost two weeks since I’ve started the background check and drug test processes and I haven’t heard anything back from the company and my first day is supposed to be on Monday, October 14th. Does this process normally take longer than a week? I already gave my two weeks notice at my current job and I’m getting nervous that I made the wrong move and now I’m going to end up jobless, which was not my plan at all. Please help calm my nerves, I’m freaking out over here!
