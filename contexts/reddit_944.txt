I have anxiety and I'm terrified of confrontation so I create arguments in my head where I can say what I really feel. Does anyone else relate to this or am I just weird?
I'm scared of having a debate with any of my friends because I'm afraid that they'll use that as a reason to not bother with me anymore, like they've been looking for a valid reason to get away from me so they'll take any small argument as a reason to escape. Every time I get even into the smallest of debates, I'll *always* feel like the bad guy, even if I didn't cause it or even if I'm right. I hate making people upset so I'd rather admit I'm wrong (even if I'm not) or apologise just so it pacifies the other person. I always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where I say what I actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but it's also empowering because I'm saying what's on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real. Am I just spineless or is this something that others feel?
