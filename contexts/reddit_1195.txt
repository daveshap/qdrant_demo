Anyone else feel so anxious yet they instantly "sober up"/relax when other anxious people are in need of your emotional support?
As the title says, I find that in really tough situations where I'm having a bad day - I instantly feel less tense when I see someone else suffering from severe anxiety. In fact, I always reach out to them (here and irl) and offer them advice which makes me feel better too. Now if only I took my own advice seriously...
