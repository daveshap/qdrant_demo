Trying to DBAN 2009 Mac Mini I'm trying to DBAN -- or otherwise wipe -- my old 2009 Mac OS X 10.6 Mac mini.  The CD drive on the Mac is broken, so I have been trying to do it with a bootable USB.  No matter what I try, I cannot get the USB drive to show in Startup Manager.This is what I've got so far:DBAN 2.3 iso downloadedUNetbootin to make the bootable imageThe Cruzer pen-drive is formatted HFS+ with GUID Partition map -- DiskUtil reports the non-EFI, DBAN partition as bootable.I've tried various key combinations to reset NVRAM,I've follow apple.com advice on how to set legacy insecure behavior on NVRAM... but still I can only see the Macintosh HD as boot drive. I have tried Command, Shift, Option and Period but nothing happens.I started with the USB drive formatted FAT32, MBR Partition table and moved on from there.Edit: I originally thought this was a 2011 Mac Mini, I was looking in the wrong place for the year. It turns out that it being from 2009 was vitally important,
