ROSE: So.
MR. JOHNNY: Where is she?
ROSE: Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
MR. JOHNNY: It's late.
ROSE: Yes.
MR. JOHNNY: Maybe I should go?
ROSE: What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
MR. JOHNNY: That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
ROSE: A miracle. Well, that's news.
MR. JOHNNY: My mother's recovered.
ROSE: You're kidding?
MR. JOHNNY: The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
ROSE: That's incredible.
MR. JOHNNY: Yes.
