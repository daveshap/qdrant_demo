don't give up on your mental health (grateful for helping friend) - Day 131
[Mental health issues? Just don't give up](https://youtu.be/k-w6dH9Xicw)

It's 10 o'clock at night, it's icy cold, and all afternoon I've been helping a friend move house.

I certainly don't want to be making a Gratitude Bridge video right now.

I haven't missed one in 130 days, so I'm not missing one today.

Gratitude Bridge is vital for my mental health, my recovery.

The discipline of this project has helped me more than anything else I've done.

today, I am grateful for helping a friend and not giving up

What are you grateful for?

*This is part of my 365 days of gratitude to work through my depression and the spiral into suicide attempts over the last two years. I have been posting a video daily on Youtube and Depression on my journey to get out of Depression 'Gratitude Bridge'*
