SALLY: Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children. You won't have to do anything at all! You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
WASHINGTON: You know very well who it is that I love.
SALLY: Is that the truth? Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
SALLY: George, you know I only love you, but...
WASHINGTON: But not more than your comfort.
SALLY: And what is this, then? Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot? Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
WASHINGTON: That's a lie!
SALLY: Is it? William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial? I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
WASHINGTON: Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
SALLY: Now that is a lie! See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet! When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William! Do you hear? You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
WASHINGTON: I'd throw everything away for you.
SALLY: You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
WASHINGTON: I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
SALLY: Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
WASHINGTON: Really? Which precious homily was it?
SALLY: Mankind is born free
WASHINGTON: Arnold!
ARNOLD: I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
