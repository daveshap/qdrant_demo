Standards for conducted EMI testing I have some doubts to interpret the CISPR standards, one of them is in relation to the test environment for EMI conducted (150kHz up to 30MHz). The minimum size indicated for the vertical or horizontal ground plane is 2m x 2m. Would it be constructively possible to join two planes of 2m x 1m to form one?Some with this knowledge could help me?Thank you.
