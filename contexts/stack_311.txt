How can I go to the previous desktop in Mission Control using a hot key? Say, I have 10 desktops. I'm on the desktop 2. I switch to the deskotp 7 using the F3 key and touchpad. Is there a standard hot key for switching back to the deskotp 2? And then back to the deskotp 7. Similar to Alt+Tab, but for the desktops.
