Would PhD be a good idea for a person like me ?
I'm just finishing my Master's degree (last semester) and wondering about my future prospects.
I have delved deep into the opportunities that stand my way due to my Life Sciences degree and am starting to feel lost.

It's just how risky getting into research is. You have mo surity of employment,  and may as well get stuck as a permadoc well into your 40s. That's more than 15 years of your life. Faculty positions are pretty hard to come by , that comes as no surprise. 

Imagine walking into your PhD with a star in your eye and you quickly realise that soon you would have to jump from one contract to another in order to make a living. Wasting away your youth engaged in gruelling work where u are not only underpaid , but also underappreciated. There's always the fear of not giving results or not receiving another contract.

I have heard countless stories of Postdoctoral candidates being extremely lonely and depressed. This would be a far from ideal situation for a person like me who often deals with anxiety and panic attacks. And the fact that I wont even have any family or close friends around to support me just scares me to the max. Depression would soon follow . And it just stops me from functioning all together .

I hope I have the correct picture of how academia is. Any advice and suggestions would not only be welcome , but also highly awaited .
