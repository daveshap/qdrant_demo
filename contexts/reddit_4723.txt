Sick of everything
I hate to post stuff like this on the internet but fuck it I guess.

I'm just sick of everything, I want to live life to the fullest but there seems to be something always in the way of it, like intrusive thoughts that just mess with me. I try to ignore them but sometimes they seem stronger than me.

And today, to make matters worse I just received my first test of the year (I'm in high school btw) and I was very disappointed with my grade, which makes me depressed because it makes me feel like I'll never be anyone in life. In the past I've always had good grades but I don't even know anymore. I just seriously hope this phase of my life goes away.
