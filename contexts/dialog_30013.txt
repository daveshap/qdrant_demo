TOBY: I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended. I'm stompin' your ass.
BOBBY: You idiot! You don't even know what you're fighting over!
TOBY: My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
JENNY: Toby! Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
TOBY: You stay away, Jenny. I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
JENNY: Don't be afraid of him none. I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
BOBBY: Get away from me!
TOBY: Now, what's this?
BOBBY: Give it to me!
TOBY: Mexico? You going to Mexico?
BOBBY: I'm leaving. You never have to see me again. Just please, give me the ticket!
TOBY: This means something to you? Jenny means something to me.
