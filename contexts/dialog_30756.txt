ELENA: You should have heard her play.
CLAIRE: Stop.
ELENA: We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
CLAIRE: Do we have to?
ELENA: And I kicked ass. My best stuff. Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
CLAIRE: She's making this up.
ELENA: I'm not. Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
