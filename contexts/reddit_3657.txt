I hate this dating game. I'd love a first date with all the rules thrown out the window.
Wild concept. Just my imagination going but I'd love a first date with a woman where neither of us give a shit about the rules of dating and just want pure honesty. We both show up in sweatpants and the t-shirt we were wearing the night before, her hair in a messy bun and mine not touched since I got out of bed and neither of us are in the best of moods. We'll talk about past relationships and the flaws that make us a not-so-perfect partner while passing a blunt back and forth.

"Hi I'm Jon. I'm not very experienced with dating. I was in love once but it didn't work out and I kind of didn't trust women for a long time, so I hid in a shell to avoid getting my heart broken again, I'm just trying to better myself bit by bit and day by day and I think maybe dating someone might be good for me. I've gained a lot of emotional maturity lately and I think I might be ready.  
So, where did you fuck up? why are you here? got any war stories?"
