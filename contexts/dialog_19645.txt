RAKONIN: I am sorry... I have to leave.
SWANA: Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
SWANA: This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon! ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
LEON: What does he say?
SWANA: Shhh! ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
LEON: What did he say?
SWANA: It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
LEON: Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?
