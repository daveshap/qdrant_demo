Potential to finish grad program in 1 year instead of 2. Thoughts?
So, my title is pretty self explanatory.  I have crunched the numbers and at the rate I am going with my Higher Ed program, I can easily finish by taking 1-2 classes during my summer 2018 session.  I have a Graduate Assistantship in Career Services that could be extended for a 2nd year (if needed), as well as I have been interning in Academic Advising & Career Services at another university since June.  

Upon finishing my program this July, I would have a little over 1 year of GA experience and 1 year of Internship experience in Career/Academic Advising which is what I want to pursue a career in.  I am looking to stay within the midwest but am not opposed to moving cities or nearby states, and am really open to any type of institution at this point.  I more so am worried about getting a role where I advise students in some capacity so I can continue to develop that area of my career. 

My biggest question is do you all think I should stretch my program to two years so I have 2 years of GA and Internship experiences? I am also worried that finishing in mid-july may hinder my job search process. I can do my last classes online which means I could start a job in May if they are willing to let me begin while finishing my last class of my degree.   Would it be smarter to stay in school and finish May of 2019 and just graduate with way more credits than I need to take but have more experience? I know getting into advising right out of school is tough, so I want to make the right choice but also not live the poor grad student life for another year if I do not need to.  

Thanks in advance!!!
