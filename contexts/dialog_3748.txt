DECKARD: There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
SALOME: I don't know nothing about it.
DECKARD: You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
SALOME: How do you mean 'exploited'?
DECKARD: Like to get this position. Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
SALOME: Are you for real?
DECKARD: Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here. I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
SALOME: What the fuck for?
DECKARD: For holes.
