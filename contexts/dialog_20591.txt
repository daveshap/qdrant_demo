DORIE: Thank you, 'Mam.
EVELYN: Tell me something, Dorie. A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
DORIE: I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man. They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat. I shine the officer's shoes. In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
EVELYN: You take care, Dorie.
DORIE: You too, 'Mam.
