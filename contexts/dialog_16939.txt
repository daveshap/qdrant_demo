CREASY: Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
PINTA: Frank. Frankie.
CREASY: That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
PINTA: You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
CREASY: Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
PINTA: There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
CREASY: Then be trained.
PINTA: I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
CREASY: Be a swimmer.
PINTA: I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
