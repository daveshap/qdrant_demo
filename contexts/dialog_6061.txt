LELAND: Charlie, it's just no go. We can't agree anymore. I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
KANE: Why, Brad?
LELAND: I want to be transferred to the new paper. You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to - That's not what I wanted to talk about.
KANE: I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
LELAND: No, that won't help. Besides, you never get drunk. I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
KANE: All right.
LELAND: She's going to leave you -
KANE: I don't think so, Brad. We've just had word that the President is out of danger. It seems I didn't kill him after all.
LELAND: She was going to leave you anyway -
LELAND: Emily's going south next week with the child. As far as anybody's to know, it's a holiday. When they get back -
KANE: Brad, you are drunk.
LELAND: Sure I am. She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes. I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
KANE: Why is she leaving me?
LELAND: She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
KANE: Do you think the Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?"
LELAND: You might have made the whole thing less personal!
