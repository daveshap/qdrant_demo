DIGNAN: See if mine are in there.
ANTHONY: Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
DIGNAN: Yes, they are.
ANTHONY: Look at the treads on those.
DIGNAN: What about them?
ANTHONY: They obviously weren't designed for racing.
DIGNAN: Well, those treads stink. You'd blow a knee out racing on those.
BOB: Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
ANTHONY: OK, Dad.
DIGNAN: Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
ANTHONY: You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan. In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
DIGNAN: That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
ANTHONY: Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
DIGNAN: You were spoiled rotten.
