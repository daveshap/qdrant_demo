REMINDER: Your aches and pains are normal, you are safe, you will be okay, you deserve to rest
I know quarantine gives us all plenty of time to think and hyperfocus on certain physical or emotional feelings. I am here to remind you that you WILL be okay. Don't give up. 

Your physical symptoms, although they feel very real, are normal and aren't going to hurt you. I PROMISE. I know they are so annoying, but the more you wish them away, the more persistent they become. 

You deserve to rest. I know everyone expects productivity from you right now, but it's okay to sleep longer than usual, play video games, or eat what you want. Do what you can, not what you think you should be doing. If everything feels like it's going to shit, take a few deep breaths, turn on some rain noises and take a nap.

Cut yourself some slack. You are going through a tough time. You are exhausted. You are tired of feeling like crap. It feels like it's never going to end. So give yourself a break. This shit is tough, but so are you. Don't beat yourself up.

Three months ago I was genuinely in the worst place in my life. Panic attacks sending me to the ER, dozens of doctors appointments, genuinely convinced I was on the brink of a heart attack. But here I am! Perfectly healthy, and so are you. I pinky promise everything is going to be okay.
