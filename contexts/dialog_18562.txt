ARCHIE: What's this?
BROWN: It's a diary.
ARCHIE: Be careful who sees it.
BROWN: What do you take me for?
ARCHIE: You should have someone look after you.
BROWN: I'm all right. I just need to rest up a wee bit. The room ... You don't have to stay.
ARCHIE: The place is a mess.
BROWN: I can't move to tidy.
ARCHIE: It's what the maids are for.
BROWN: I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
ARCHIE: Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
BROWN: She needs me, Archie. She canna do without me, she said it to my face. How can I stop now?
BROWN: You sent for me.
DISRAELI: I've been called back to London. My last day. I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
DISRAELI: Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God. You must miss such magnificent views.
BROWN: I don't think about it.
DISRAELI: Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
BROWN: I'm fine.
DISRAELI: You're injured.
BROWN: It's nothing.
DISRAELI: Still, someone must attend you. Your wife should not have let you out.
BROWN: I'm not married.
DISRAELI: Oh.
BROWN: This is the top.
