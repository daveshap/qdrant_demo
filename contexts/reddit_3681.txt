I've tried Reddit's dating advice for a year. This is what I've learned:
About a year ago, I just got out of a long-ass relationship and wanted to date but had no idea how. So I read a lot of Reddit posts about dating advice.

The most common advice was, "Go to Meetups or any social gatherings and make female friends". This strategy was based on two things: 

1. Online dating sucks.

2. You can develop your friendship into a romantic relationship or be introduced to someone who is interested in you through female friends.

So I tried the advice above for a year and found out, **this is not a good strategy.** I went to a lot of Meetups and I can tell you this, Meetup is overrated. However, I was able to make lots of female friends (I had to try so freaking hard), and this is where the strategy starts to show flaws. The chance of developing a friendship into a romantic relationship exists (low), but the problem is that it takes a long time to figure out if it's gonna work or not. It can take years.

You can't expect your friends to find your lover for you. Friends are just friends, you can't have another intention. You're on your own!

So, what you should do? Here's my advice (and this advice is also coming from my female friends). Don't try to be a friend. **Just ask out for a date within 1-3 meetings**. And move on. I know it's really awkward and embarrassing. But this way you don't waste your time. You can increase your chance of being accepted if you build a good friendship with that person, but again, it takes too much time. And the chance is just a **slight difference.** You can ask dozens of people out for that period of time. Do the math.

I agree that online dating sucks. But look around you, most couples nowadays met through online dating sites. I know that the chance is very low, but it is what it is. **Unfortunately, there's no better way.**
