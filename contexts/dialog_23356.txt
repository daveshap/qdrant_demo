ELLEN: Martin, it's not funny!
MARTIN: You know, it's not always easy for me, either. But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
ELLEN: Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other? Honesty - trust!
MARTIN: Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
