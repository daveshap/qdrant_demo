JEZZIE: You up?
JACOB: No. Have you seen my glasses?
JEZZIE: Where'd you leave 'em?
JACOB: I don't know.
JEZZIE: Did you look around the headboard?
JACOB: Jezzie, I can't see.
JEZZIE: Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
JACOB: Thanks. What's that?
JEZZIE: Your kid dropped it off.
JACOB: Who? Jed?
JEZZIE: No. The little one.
JACOB: Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
JEZZIE: They're weird names.
JACOB: They're Biblical. They were prophets.
JEZZIE: Well, personally, I never went for church names.
JACOB: And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
JEZZIE: I don't let anybody call me that.
JACOB: You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
JEZZIE: You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
JACOB: Yeah, but for what?
JEZZIE: A good lay.
JACOB: And look what I got.
JEZZIE: The best.
JACOB: I must have been out of my head.
JEZZIE: Jake, you are never out of your head!
JACOB: What's in here?
JEZZIE: Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school."
JACOB: Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
JEZZIE: Lemme see.
JACOB: Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
JEZZIE: That's Sarah? I can see what you mean.
JACOB: What?
JEZZIE: Why you left.
JACOB: What do you mean you can see?
JEZZIE: Look at her face. A real bitch.
JACOB: She looked good then.
JEZZIE: Not to me.
JACOB: Well, you didn't marry her.
