She said yes to being my valentine, trouble is I didn't plan that far. Tips?
Yeah, got no clue. Plus all the theaters are closed rn. What can a couple 17 year olds do on valentine's day?


(Edit 1: Did not expect so many people to care. I want to thank each and every one of you for your advice/encouragement/witty remarks. 
Some of you have asked me to keep you updated so if you care about that sort of thing stay tuned. Love you all.

Edit 2: Unfortunately we did not go out because her mother was worried about the ongoing virus outbreak :/. Thanks again to everyone for the great comments. I'll be sure to take her out when this whole corona virus thing is over.)
