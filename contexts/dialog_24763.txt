CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES: What?
KYLE'S MOTHER: The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them! Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
TERRANCE: Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
PHILLIP: I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
TERRANCE: Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
PHILLIP: You bet, Terrance!
PHILLIP: HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
TERRANCE: I sure did, Phillip!!
STAN: Did you see that, Wendy?
WENDY: Yup.
KYLE: Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
CARTMAN: Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
KENNY: Mph rmpmh rm.
CARTMAN: No way.
STAN: Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
WENDY: Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
STAN: <u>WHAT?!</u>
