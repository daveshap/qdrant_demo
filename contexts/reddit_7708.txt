Job interview questions (non-faculty positions) that I could/should have answered better
I know there are several people on this thread who are planning to work in non-faculty positions after they graduate.  Since I'm in the interview process for several non-academic jobs at the moment, I thought I would share a couple of questions that I was asked at a recent interview that I *could* have answered pretty well if I had more time to think about them. 

* If you have multiple, high-priority deadlines that overlap, how do you handle them?
* What's a project you've worked on that has had problems, and how did you solve them?
* When have you felt pressure to complete a difficult task, and how did you handle it?
* Describe a time you explained a complex analysis to an audience who was unfamiliar with the methodology. What did you explain, and how did you do it so they could understand?

Other than the last question, I think these are pretty general and could apply to most positions at most organizations.  And obviously, as a former or current graduate student, you've encountered a lot of situations like these questions describe.  I thought the heads-up might give people a chance to produce a slightly less rambling and off-topic answer than the ones I gave :)
