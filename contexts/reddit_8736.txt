Referencing opposition from State and Local lawmakers, Amazon has backed out of building a headquarters in New York. What Federal, State, and Local incentives were originally offered to Amazon to build in NY? What specific actions and statements did lawmakers take to make Amazon feel unwelcome?
In 2017, Amazon announced that they would be building a new headquarters and [solicited bids from cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/technology/amazon-headquarters-north-america.html?module=inline) to determine what incentives each city could offer.

Amazon later decided they would split their headquarters to two locations, [one in Virginia and one in New York](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/technology/amazon-second-headquarters-split.html?action=click&module=inline&pgtype=Homepage).

Now, as of Feb. 14, 2019, [Amazon has decided to not build one of their new buildings in NY](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/nyregion/amazon-hq2-queens.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage).

Originally Amazon was set to receive some $3 billion in government incentives, but pushback had been mounting over a successful company receiving such credits (in 3rd source):

> Amazon on Thursday canceled its plans to build an expansive corporate campus in New York City after facing an unexpectedly fierce backlash from some lawmakers and union leaders, who contended that a tech giant did not deserve nearly $3 billion in government incentives.

Amazon put out a statement highlighting the pushback (in 3rd source):

> “A number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward,’’ Amazon said in a statement.

The New York Times states this is a negative for both the Governor of New York State and Mayor of New York City (in 3rd source):

> The company’s decision is a major blow for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had set aside their differences to bring the company to New York.

I have a few questions trying to understand what was originally offered to Amazon, and what political actions were taken before they ultimately pulled out:

1: What specific incentives was Amazon set to receive for building its New York campus? Were the incentives Federal, State, or Local, and in what share?

2: In their decision not to build, Amazon makes reference to opposition by State and Local politicians. Specifically, what opposition are they talking about? Was there any legislative action in the works at either State or Local levels to change the terms that were offered to Amazon originally?

3: Amazon also states that with Local and State politicians they would not be able to "...build the type of relationships that are required to go forward." Beyond the initial $3 billion in incentives, has Amazon stated what type of additional support or help they would need from politicians, as this statement implies?
