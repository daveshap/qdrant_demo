FRIDA: Everything okay?
PETER: A man killed in Central Park.
JENNIFER: So where's this infamous arm now?
FRIDA: I put it down the garbage disposal.
JENNIFER: And what makes you think you killed a man?
FRIDA: Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
JENNIFER: You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
FRIDA: No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.
JENNIFER: You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
FRIDA: It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
JENNIFER: Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
FRIDA: I haven't gotten it yet.
JENNIFER: Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
FRIDA: I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
FRIDA: I think I'm a werewolf.
SHRINK: Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
FRIDA: I ate a guy last night.
SHRINK: And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
FRIDA: I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
SHRINK: Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
FRIDA: We didn't have sex.
SHRINK: You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose eating him" as the method of killing?"
FRIDA: Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
SHRINK: You use the word fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex."
GEORGE: I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
JENNIFER: It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
GEORGE: You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
JENNIFER: Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
GEORGE: Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
JENNIFER: Take some allergy medicine.
GEORGE: You can't believe this bullshit.
JENNIFER: She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
