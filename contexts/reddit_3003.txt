How could I ever get into these "jobs for history majors" I see on internet lists, it feels like I'm so unqualified for anything?
 I see all these jobs like "human resources personnel" or "market analyst" or "growth hacker" or "event planner" or "paralegal" and they all sound fine and dandy, and I'd be ok with any of those and I feel very confident I could do them if I were trained, but if I look at positions online it's always "have 25 years of experience and a degree in an ultra specific field of finance!" I am exaggerating of course, but even so it still seems hopeless. It feels like I am qualified for nothing. I'm great and reading and writing and research and all that, but they all want different degrees. I feel like I might be able to convince someone to hire me if I could get in front of them, but that is much easier said than done. My resume is so shit I doubt I could ever get to an interview.
