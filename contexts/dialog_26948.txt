NICHOLAS: Don't even think about it.
CHRISTINE: Why not?
NICHOLAS: Read what it says: Warning
CHRISTINE: If there was one.
NICHOLAS: ... wait for help." Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to."
CHRISTINE: Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
NICHOLAS: I'll give you a boost.
CHRISTINE: You first.
NICHOLAS: This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
CHRISTINE: You pull me up.
NICHOLAS: It's much easier this way. Come on, step up...
CHRISTINE: No.
NICHOLAS: Please...
CHRISTINE: I'm not wearing underwear. Okay? There, I said it. Satisfied.
NICHOLAS: Oh. FIne.
NICHOLAS: There's a ladder here.
CHRISTINE: My hero. Let's go.
