Ubuntu 17.10 laptop doesn't suspend on lid close Thinkpad T450 running Ubuntu 17.10 which was clean-installed (not upgraded) some weeks back. I frequently moved from room to room and like the laptop to go to sleep when I close the lid. It seems to never do this, staying awake all the time. I have to hold down the power button in the indicator and choose the pause icon to suspend it. Previous releases of Ubuntu used to \"Just Work\".I have tried toggling the option in Tweaks to ensure it is set to suspend on lid close, but this makes no difference. Is this a bug or expected behaviour?
