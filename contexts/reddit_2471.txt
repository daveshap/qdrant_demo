Have you ever been a "bad employee" in one company but then became a good one in another?
Left a job months ago because toxic workplace/not a good fit but still in contact with old coworkers. One of my old coworkers became my replacement and they ask/tell me things about the things I used to be responsible for. I still talk to them because they've become friends and I help out because I feel guilty for leaving them.

Now, there are some problems that surfaced (that I wasn't aware of during my time there). Sometimes I feel like the only reason they're talking to me is just so they can rub my mistakes in my face or something (emphasis on feel, I don't think that they are the kind of people to do something like that intentionally).

I got a new job and I am excited. But talking to this old coworker is making me feel anxious and scared and making me feel all the things I used to feel back then, like hating myself and feeling like I am not able to do anything right.

I just want to know if anyone else felt like that they were a bad employee but became a good one in a new company.

TLDR; I think I was a bad employee in my old company. Can I still be a good one in a new company?

Edit: Thank you for your responses. I sincerely appreciate all of them and you guys really are helping me with your own experiences and advice. Stay safe everyone!

Edit 2: Edited text to clear things up. I've also pinpointed why I feel bad (and feeling what I am feeling now). I have made mistakes at the old job and I feel like everything is my fault whenever said coworker talks to me regarding work because those things were my responsibilties before. I am now scared of being a bad employee again at this new job and I don't want to be.
