The nicest rejection I've ever gotten.
Hi r/jobs, 


I just wanted to stop by to vent and share my experience.  I have been on the job hunt for about 10 months; 4 months unemployed and VERY actively interviewing, testing, and (as the title implies) getting rejected. 


I just finished the process of interviewing for a position supporting the Superintendent and Board of Trustees of a small, public school district.  Long story short, it was down to me and one other candidate.  I "knocked [the first interview] way out of the park" and met with the Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent on Monday.  I just got a phone call from the Superintendent himself and I was told the following: 


* You didn't get the job, but I'm calling because you did very, very well in the process.

* You have incredible potential and your references/qualifications speak to that.


* There's nothing else you could've done; I don't want you to think that you could've done x, y, z or done anything differently. 


* You're at a great point in your career; there was nothing else you could've done. 


* It was a matter of circumstance. 


* We have some openings in the Spring and we really want you to keep us in mind.  We will probably be reaching out to you before you reach out to us. 


I've been in similar positions (i.e. getting to the last round and getting beaten out) probably about a dozen times in the past couple of months and I'm so **very** tired of hearing "you have incredible potential *BUT* we went with another candidate."  


I don't know what I'm looking for here, maybe just an outlet to express my exasperation with this process.  But here I am.  I really have done everything I can to prepare myself for each interview; I just (stupidly) let myself get really invested in the idea of this particular position.  Has anyone else felt this way?  What do you think of what he said to me; was it bullsh*t or was it genuine (no one knows for sure, I know..)?  How do I muster the strength to move forward?  I'm so tired of constant rejection and (fake?) validation at the same time.  I can't help but feel defeated each time this happens.  I'm overall a more bitter, jaded person because of this experience.  


I guess it's just two steps forward, one step back.  As cliche as that sounds.  I've got another few interviews lined up and I'm having trouble refocusing on what I need to accomplish because of this blow.
