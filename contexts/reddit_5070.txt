How do you keep from getting broken down by the job hunting process?
I've been looking for/applying for jobs for the last year and not having much success. 

So far, out of everything, I only had two interviews. One job went to someone else, the other I'm in limbo about whether or not I made the cut to the second round of interviews. 

I'm having problems with depression and my self-worth due to being constantly rejected or ignored. I feel like I'm an attractive/qualified candidate for most of what I apply for, but obviously not if I'm struggling this much.

How do I keep myself from getting upset over this? It's hard to keep trying when nothing has worked.
