WARD: Loose machines are right back over there.
ACE: What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
WARD: Okay, I'll -
ACE: What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
WARD: Well...
ACE: These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
WARD: Yeah, okay.
ACE: The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
WARD: All right, I will, I will.
ACE: Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
WARD: I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
ACE: Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
WARD: Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry.
