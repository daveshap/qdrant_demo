Hiring manager said she would call then didn't. Should I have called her?
I applied for a position on the company website. I received an email  from the hiring manager a few days later asking when I would be available for a phone interview. After giving her my availability, she responded with a date and time and said she would call me then. Well the time has now passed, after I waited for an over an hour at this point. My SO thinks I should have called the number in her email signature. I am not sure what the etiquette here is though. What do you think? Their hours state that they are now closed anyway.
