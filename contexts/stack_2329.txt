My Villagers won't breed My villager breeder won't work.I've made a villager breeder and I have about 8 villagers in it, I've fed the villagers with a few stacks of carrots, potatoes, beets and bread. The villagers are  displaying heart particles but don't produce baby villagers. I have one bucket of water on the ground below streaming the villagers into a trading station (obviously there are no villagers to stream) and I was wondering if this prevents the villagers to breed (like other mob spawns).
