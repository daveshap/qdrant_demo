DONNIE: I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
MS. FARMER: Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
DONNIE: I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
MS. FARMER: The Lifeline is divided that way.
DONNIE: Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
MS. FARMER: Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
DONNIE: Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
DONNIE: People aren't that simple.
MS. FARMER: If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
