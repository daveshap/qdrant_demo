KLAATU: All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
BOBBY: Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
KLAATU: I'll say goodnight again.
HELEN: Mr. Carpenter, I-- Goodnight.
KLAATU: Goodnight, my dear.
HELEN: Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
BOBBY: Okay.
HELEN: Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
BOBBY: Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
HELEN: Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
BOBBY: Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
BOBBY: Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
HELEN: What do you mean, dear?
BOBBY: I mean -- on account of that policeman last night. You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
HELEN: No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it. 'Night, darling.
