KATHRYN: They said you'd be here.
MIKE: What's up?
KATHRYN: I need more pressure in the shark tank.
MIKE: Okay.
KATHRYN: I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow. Would you do that for me?
MIKE: Sure. Let's go.
KATHRYN: No, we'll go through here.
MIKE: ... Mean through the tubes?
KATHRYN: Yes. It's faster.
MIKE: No, I'm not going through there.
KATHRYN: Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way. You're not going to walk all the way around?
MIKE: I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
KATHRYN: They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
MIKE: I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
KATHRYN: Michael, I don't have time. Please! It's time you dealt with this and got over it. Now come on!
KATHRYN: Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
MIKE: ... He ought to put him in here.
KATHRYN: It's too soon to move him.
MIKE: So tell Calvin.
KATHRYN: I did. He wants it on exhibit.
MIKE: Well, that's why you got it.
