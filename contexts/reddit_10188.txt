My Mom showed off my suicide letter like it was a fashion statement
So basically i tried to do it a couple of months ago, had everything prepared, was ready to just end it all. Until all of a sudden i got way too scared and decided to call it off

My mom saw the letter that i was supposed to leave and went behind my back showed it off to her friends and some family members then talked to me about it,

I became  some sort of beacon of attention which i hated people telling me that "it'll get better" or saying if it was true Sometimes i kinda wished i wasnt such a pussy and ended it right then and there, couldve saved myself from embarrasment
