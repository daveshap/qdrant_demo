CHRISTY: Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one. Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
MARY LAZARUS: You re okay -- for a civilian.
MARY ROBERT: Reverend Mother?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Yes?
MARY ROBERT: Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet? For final vows?
CHRISTY: I don't think so. What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert. We shall have a serious discussion.
CHRISTY: What about me, Reverend Mother? I think you were right. I'm just a bad influence. Sister show biz.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Perhaps not. Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
CHRISTY: Really? And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Don't push it.
MARY ROBERT: I WAS DOWNHEARTED
CHRISTY: It's true!
MARY ROBERT: I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
CHRISTY: Don't you know it!
MARY ROBERT: BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
CHRISTY: What did He say?
MARY ROBERT: HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
MARY PATRICK: MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
CHRISTY: It's true -- I know her.
MARY PATRICK: DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
CHRISTY: What a shame!
MARY PATRICK: BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
CHRISTY: Pay attention...
MARY PATRICK: SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
CHRISTY: Were you wicked?
CHOIR: SING!
CHRISTY: Were you tempted?
CHOIR: SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
CHRISTY: But I'm fearful!
CHOIR: SING!
CHRISTY: And I'm tearful!
CHOIR: SING!
CHRISTY: YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
