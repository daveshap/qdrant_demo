LLOYD: Diane Court.
JOE: Dude, I can't do it!
LLOYD: That was a mistake. The rain on my car is a baptism. The new me. Iceman, power Lloyd. My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey. If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
DC: Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
LLOYD: I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
COREY: Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart. Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
DC: Visit her at the home.
LLOYD: I'm not going back there. I don't even know who you're talking about.
DC: Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
LLOYD: 'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
COREY: No, you're not a guy.
LLOYD: I am.
COREY: The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy.
LLOYD: If she wants me, she can come to me.
LLOYD: Hi, Lloyd. This is my eighth and final call...
JIM: Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
LLOYD: I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something. I'm going to give you another chance. Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening. Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
DIANE: If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
JIM: Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
