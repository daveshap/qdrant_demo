PROXIMO: Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer: you take a fall.
NARCISSUS: What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
PROXIMO: You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood. Gushes out everywhere! It's really impressive. Fantastic! Better than the real thing!
NARCISSUS: So I pretend I'm dead. You get gold, what do I get?
PROXIMO: You get to come alive again in the country!
NARCISSUS: As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
PROXIMO: The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
NARCISSUS: Spend my days beheading country bumpkins? I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
PROXIMO: But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third! When I get paid... just take the fall! You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
NARCISSUS: Pressures on, eh Proximo? There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
PROXIMO: It's absolutely not like that! This is for your own good! Come on get the rest of your armor on!
