STELLA: Keep your mind off her.
JEFF: She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
STELLA: And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
JEFF: Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
STELLA: Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
JEFF: And some man will lose his.
STELLA: Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
JEFF: Well, the salesman could be available soon.
STELLA: He and his wife splitting up?
JEFF: It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
STELLA: Isn't he a salesman?
JEFF: Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
STELLA: Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
JEFF: He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
STELLA: His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
JEFF: Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
STELLA: But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
STELLA: What about this morning? Any developments?
JEFF: No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
STELLA: In this heat? They're up now.
