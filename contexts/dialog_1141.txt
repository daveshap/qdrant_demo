COLLOREDO: No! I won't have him back.
LEOPOLD: But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
COLLOREDO: Hardly.
LEOPOLD: Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
COLLOREDO: I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
LEOPOLD: Sir -
COLLOREDO: Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
LEOPOLD: Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
COLLOREDO: And how will you make him keep it?
LEOPOLD: Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
COLLOREDO: You have leave to try.
LEOPOLD: Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
