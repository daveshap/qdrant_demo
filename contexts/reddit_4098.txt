How much time to reply do you give people these days? How patient are you until you move on?
In a time where people are constantly busy and occupied with all manner of things, how much time do you give people these days until you just move on?
 
I had a case recently of somebody who really only replied every 3-4 days, it was impossible to get a conversation flow going. They seemed nice enough but if they dont make time to get to know me, I think things are doomed from the start.
