JANE: Well, whatever you think.
AARON: I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better. That's why.
JANE: Sounds like you may be on to something.
AARON: Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not tell you? -- it's a happy thing. In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further. Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
JANE: You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
AARON: Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
JANE: Yes.
AARON: Good.
