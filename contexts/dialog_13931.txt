LOUIS: And the vampires of the Theatre?
ARMAND: Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
ARMAND: Are these not the answers you came for?
LOUIS: Yes... My God...
ARMAND: A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
LOUIS: Lestat! You knew Lestat!
ARMAND: Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
