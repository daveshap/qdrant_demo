What happens if a House of Representatives standing committee doesn’t have a full membership roster. Specifically, if a party refuses to name members to the committee.
This is in regards to the house intelligence committee and the fact the GOP hasn’t named members yet (besides Nunez who is their ranking member). Is this lawful? How long can this go on for? Are there any penalties to refusing to do so? Is there any recourse? What can GOP constituents whose elected representatives fail to do their job and represent them (besides voting them out next election) ?
