I got the job!
I just got the email from Mcdonalds and i'm so fucking happy! I can finally make my own money, and I plan to move out of my house eventually. After 2 years of depression, anxiety, and self doubt i'm finally moving forward in my life. I can almost cry honestly, I never thought I could beat my anxiety and depression. This is a new chapter of my life, and i'm positive it will only get better! Much love everyone, and I hope you all succeed. <3
