It's time. Goodbye Reddit.
I am currently driving to visit my grandmothers grave for one last time. Then I will attempt to OD, if I fail then I will give an update. If I don't update then I am either dead or in the hospital. I just thought I should update those that have tried to help me. Thank you all and please just remember that my mind was already made up. 

To everyone else on this sub Reddit. I hope that you all can overcome the difficulties that are trying to bring you down. If not I understand, I am in that place where it will never get better. 

Goodbye. I love you all.
