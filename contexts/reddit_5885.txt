Learning the mortgage industry
I just started a new job 2 weeks ago at a bank working the lock desk for mortgages. This is 110% brand new territory for me. I know nothing about mortgages: how they work on the borrowers side and how they work on the investor/lender side (slowly, slowly learning). How can I supplement work information with learning the ins and outs of the mortgage industry?
