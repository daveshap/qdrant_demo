How can I identify a raid boss Pok\u00e9mon from a regular one in my Pok\u00e9mon bag? Let's say I have a Magikarp in my Pok\u00e9mon bag and go to a raid where the raid boss is Magikarp. I then defeat the raid boss and capture it.How do I identify which Magikarp in my Pok\u00e9mon bag is the Pok\u00e9mon from the raid battle?
