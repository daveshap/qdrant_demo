Boss leaching the client. How to deal with it?
My boss was developing a project for his client and I was hired to lead the marketing team for this specific project only. 

All is good but i have realized that my boss delivers such low quality work that product is bound to fail down the line.

I tried warning my boss about the same but he said, in the given budget this is all we can do. 

What shall I do? Stick by my employer who will fire me if product goes down or save the client from losing millions?

Please suggest.

Thank you!
