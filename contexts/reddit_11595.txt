Anytime my phone says "No caller ID" i get very shaken up because of past harrassment
i once had false charges against me and i had to deal with plenty of calls from the police who always called with "No caller ID" on my phone. Nothing ever came of it because the person making charges dropped them because they were just trying to intimidate me and at monetary cost i would have won the case because the charges were completely and utterly false. i still was harrassed by police officers who treated me like i was guilty over the phone and i made it worse by talking to them. I was unaware of the right to silence at the time and i should have just closed my mouth and lawyered up.  

 Just 20 minutes ago i got a call from no caller ID, while its probably not the police i still couldn't answer it and i just feel really shaky. ive gotten a stomach ache and i feel really on edge. This happens every single time a no caller ID calls and i can't stand it. thats whats bothering me right now.
