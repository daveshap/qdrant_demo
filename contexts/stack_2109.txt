Present Perfect and Reichenbach's model of tense I recently came across the following construction in some documentation I was reading: This document describes a solution that has been applied during the migration. To me, this seemed utterly wrong, but I was not exactly sure why.  After reading through Michaelis's \"Time and Tense\which introduced me to Reichenbach's model of tense, it seems to me that the reason comes down to the location of the reference time.  Based on the context of the situation, I understand the reference time, R, to be a completed duration occurring before the moment of utterance, S, with the event, E, not being ordered with respect to R (E,R_S).To me using the present perfect (E_S,R), with the event and reference point being different simply does not work.  The reference point is in the past along with the event, so simple past, right? Though I generally trust my gut in matters of tense and time, I am having doubts on this one.  What are your opinions on the matter?  Evan
