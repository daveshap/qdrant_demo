Well i did it?
Well guys I think I got my first date in about a year! Was randomly swiping through bumble when this girl and I matched. We hit off really well. Lots of bad jokes and random talking. We started talking about how we only wear t-shirts and jeans(don't know how that came up). After awhile I asked here on date, but we had to find goofiest shirt we could find to the  date. She seemed to really get a kick outta of it. Hopefully it goes well. Wish me luck!
