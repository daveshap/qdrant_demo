THERAPIST: And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
HIDER: Oh, fine. She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
THERAPIST: That's terrific. Don't be afraid to be demonstrative. You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
HIDER: I am. I'm really feeling pretty good. I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
THERAPIST: As long as you keep remembering why.
HIDER: Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
THERAPIST: The whole disapproval thing. If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you? -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
HIDER: I understand that.
THERAPIST: And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
HIDER: No, no, no, no.
THERAPIST: On the contrary -- this is tremendous. I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
HIDER: That would be stupid.
THERAPIST: That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
HIDER: -- a sense of proportion.
THERAPIST: A sense of proportion.
