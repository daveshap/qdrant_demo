CRONIN: You're sure?
PAMELA: What? The tapes?
CRONIN: Hold on... Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
GRETKOV: Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
ABBOTT: What do you mean?
GRETKOV: Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
ABBOTT: Save it for Bourne.
GRETKOV: What?
ABBOTT: He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now. You'll have to hurry.
GRETKOV: Bourne comes here? Why?
