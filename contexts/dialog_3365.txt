PRESIDENT: Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
BALDWIN: Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
PRESIDENT: Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
