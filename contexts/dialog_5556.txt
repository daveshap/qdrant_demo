DEVEROUX: Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
FRANKNUM: Not in my experience.
DEVEROUX: Off his wages.
FERGUS: Do you mean that?
DEVEROUX: He wants to know do I mean that.
FRANKNUM: I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
DEVEROUX: Bloody right I do...
DEVEROUX: Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
FERGUS: She's not a tart.
DEVEROUX: No, of course not, she's a lady.
FERGUS: She's not that either.
