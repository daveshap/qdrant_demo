HAMMOND: How about some ammo?
SOSNA: It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
HAMMOND: How much?
SOSNA: This is clean shit. No serial numbers and never been used...
HAMMOND: Don't mess with me. How much?
SOSNA: Five bills.
HAMMOND: Five. On credit.
SOSNA: This ain't a credit business.
HAMMOND: Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
SOSNA: Give it back.
HAMMOND: Try and take it.
SOSNA: Fuck you. You got no right for this kind of play.
HAMMOND: I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
