What Every Waitlister Is Doing Right Now (Step By Step Guide)
1.) sorting a2c sub by NEW POSTS because maybe someone posted in the last 2 seconds

2.) manually checking their email because there's a possibility that it "forgot" to notify them and it's been a LONG time ago (1 minute) since they last checked it

3.) checking their portal for a possible suprise update

4.) checking college confidential to see if anyone was accepted off the waitlist (even if it's 3am on a sunday)

5.) checking their voicemail for a hidden voicemail even though they have 0 missed calls

6.) repeating steps 1-5 until their phone dies

7.) charging their phone when it dies

(repeating steps 1-6 until 7 becomes necessary again)
