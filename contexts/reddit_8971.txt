What are the pros and cons of Britain leaving the EU?
On Thursday, the UK will hold a referendum on leaving the EU. The Leave camp argues that the EU economy has weakened considerably compared to the UK and that the EU weakens UK sovereignty. It might make sense for the UK to become more independent.

On the other hand, the Remain camp is arguing that the UK can still reap social and economic benefits if it stays in the EU. These include being able to negotiate trade with a more powerful entity behind them, access to higher education across Europe, and warning that exiting the EU puts all those benefits in jeopardy.
