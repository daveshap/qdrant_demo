Does anybody here have experience with the Zettelkasten method?
I found out about Zettelkasten about a week ago. Needless to say, I'm intrigued. It purportedly solves a lot of the biggest problems I've been having with my thesis. Naturally, the /r/Zettelkasten community is all for it. They're extremely friendly, but going there to ask how well it works is a recipe for sample bias.

Instead, I figured I'd ask here since I'm sure that many of you are having a hard time with your theses for the same reasons as me (juggling too much info, slipping into [the collector's fallacy](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/), anxiety about missing something critical, and generally overwhelming myself until I'm too anxious to move in any direction).

So, what have your experiences been? Has the Zettelkasten method helped you in grad school, been no more or less helpful than any other way of "managing your knowledge," or have you found it to be more harmful than beneficial?
