I wonder what non-anxious people think about all day.
My mind never stops. It's not always negativity and worrying (it often is), but I'm always thinking about something. Not just casually thinking, but wondering, weighing, analysing.... I try to turn it off but it feels impossible. 

What do "normal" people think about all day, especially when idle.
