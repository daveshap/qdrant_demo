SLOAN: This is a nice place. It must have cost a pretty penny.
MANTAN: Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
SLOAN: Oh you do, huh?
MANTAN: Just a little something' somethin'.
SLOAN: I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
MANTAN: Gots no intention of ending up broke.
SLOAN: Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface. You ever heard of Bert Williams? He was a great artist.
MANTAN: No, before my time.
SLOAN: You don't read, do you?
MANTAN: Never read a book in my whole life.
SLOAN: Maybe you need to start.
MANTAN: Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
SLOAN: Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up. They had no choice. They were considered 3/5ths of a human being. Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
MANTAN: Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me? This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this. You down with Delacroix.
SLOAN: I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
MANTAN: We can look out for ourselves.
