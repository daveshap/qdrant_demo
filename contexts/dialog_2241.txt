MRS. KENSINGTON: Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
VANESSA: Great.
MRS. KENSINGTON: How's Austin?
VANESSA: He's asleep.
MRS. KENSINGTON: You didn't...
VANESSA: Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
MRS. KENSINGTON: I'm proud of you.
VANESSA: Why?
MRS. KENSINGTON: Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms.
VANESSA: Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
MRS. KENSINGTON: You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
VANESSA: What about his teeth?
MRS. KENSINGTON: You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
VANESSA: I just don't see it.
MRS. KENSINGTON: Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
VANESSA: Did you ever...
MRS. KENSINGTON: Of course not. I was married to your father.
VANESSA: Did you ever want to?
MRS. KENSINGTON: Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
VANESSA: You didn't answer my question, Mum.
MRS. KENSINGTON: I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
AUSTIN: Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
VANESSA: Do you want to talk to him?
MRS. KENSINGTON: No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
VANESSA: I'm on with a friend! Look, I'd better go. I love you.
MRS. KENSINGTON: I love you, Vanessa.
AUSTIN: Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
VANESSA: Why?
AUSTIN: We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
VANESSA: A limousine has just pulled up.
AUSTIN: Let me see.
AUSTIN: Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
VANESSA: How do you know?
AUSTIN: I never forget a pussy... cat.
VANESSA: Let's go get him!
AUSTIN: He's too well-protected right now.
VANESSA: We can't just sit here, Austin.
AUSTIN: Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
VANESSA: I don't get it.
AUSTIN: Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
VANESSA: Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
AUSTIN: No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
