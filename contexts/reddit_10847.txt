I'm the worst doctor in the whole world
I can't do anything right. Academically I faceplanted my way through school. Socially I can't even get a girl to hold my hand. Even Michael Rotondo that 30-year-old basement dweller guy had a exwife and son.

If nothing else medical school gave me the necessary information on how to go out peacefully. Was it worth $200,000? I don't know but luckily after this evening I won't have to ponder it anymore.

if someone finds this from my browsing history: I'm sorry to mom and dad and "I" (first name initial, you know who you are). If it helps, I was going to kill myself earlier but wanted to wait till graduation so at least you can know your son accomplished something in life. Please use that to comfort you in the dark times ahead. I'm in a better place now.
