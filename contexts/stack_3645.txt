Classification of countermeasures for family of vulnerabilities I would like to know if anyone of you has already read about some models that would classify a set of possible countermeasures against a family of vulnerabilities. What I mean by a 'family of vulnerabilities' is, for example, vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to realize a denial of service. The countermeasure to such vulnerabilities is generally the same, or at least in the same class of countermeasure.Of course, this requires a bit of abstraction and generalization, but I believe this to exist, even if I didn't find anything yet. This could be presented in very high level way such as: software vulnerabilities are solved by this kind of countermeasures and hardware vulnerabilities by this kind. Or in more in-depth ways. STRIDE is the closet of what I am looking for so far, but there is no discussion on what countermeasure can be used against a particular threat. So if you guys know anything that is a serious track (scientific publication) or that is well used (standard?), I would appreciate some sharing :)
