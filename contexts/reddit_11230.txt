I don’t like working in IT!
I’ve been working in the IT field for about 4 years now, and it’s causing a huge sense of dread for me daily. My boss is a dick, the clients are rude, and I just don’t have any passion for the work. 

What’s bothering me is the feeling of being stuck, I have to make rent and bills and obviously can’t just walk out and quit. It seems like there isn’t a way out for me unless I put some unwanted financial pressure on myself. I ask myself what I would do if I didn’t work in IT and I honestly have no clue. 

I know I’m lucky and privileged to even have a steady job, I’m just having a hard time feeling so stagnant. Being in the office day in day out is wearing me down mentally. It’s making me feel jaded and reclusive in my personal life, like I’m losing joy and genuine interest in things/people I used to care about. I’m finding myself getting angry at things that really aren’t a big deal. I just don’t know what to do and it makes me sad.
