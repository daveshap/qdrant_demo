Suspended with Pay
I have been in charge of five mechanics, two senior and three very junior, at a manufacturing facility for about four years. Lately the company has been struggling to meet its numbers so one of my senior mechanics was moved to another shift to help. My shift suffered with the loss of experience but we struggled though. Typically it takes at least four mechanics on duty for us to keep our heads above water. Yesterday my other senior mechanic was out along with one of the junior guys. We had a disastrous day. 

Today I come in and got my normal turnovers from my peers when my boss pulls me to Human Resources. I have been suspended with pay pending a performance evaluation by HR. I was not allowed to ask any questions or make any kind of statement. I was just asked to turn over my keys, work phone, laptop, and get escorted off the site. I was not asked to empty my desk. I will get a call in 1-2 business days.

In the past six months I had received two formal counseling , one for failure to message everyone about a machine that broke down and the other for not getting in an injury report in less than 24 hours. Neither of those are recent. As far as I knew my performance has been acceptable and this suspension blindsided me. My annual evaluations have all been great with minor advice for improvement.

I work for a company in an "at-will" state

I have never seen or experienced anything like this. All of my peers who had issues were immediately terminated. I am dazed and confused right now. I don't know what a performance evaluation from HR entails. Even if they let me come back, do I even want to now that they went after me? I always keep my resume up to date and I have already starting applying. Any wisdom out there for this situation?
