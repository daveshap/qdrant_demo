Are there any real advantages to getting certificates for completed courses from EdX or Coursera?
I've been taking classes for fun this summer while I wait for grad school to start. I've been learning a lot, and I was wondering if there's any point in getting certificates for the courses. Some of them are related to my career field (education), while others are just topics of interest that I wanted to learn about (economics)

Would these look good on a resume at all, or should I save the money?

Alternatively, if I list them as completed courses on my resume but don't actually buy the certificates, would an employer/school care enough to check?
