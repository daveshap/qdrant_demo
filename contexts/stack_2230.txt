Does posting a review on Steam give me better recommendations? I know that Steam harvests all kinds of interesting data points to determine what games to recommend; for example, it recommended a 2D shooter roguelike to me \"because you spent 0.1 hours playing Enter the Gungeon.\"If I leave recommendations (good or bad) for games I own, does that give Steam more data and result in better recommendations?
