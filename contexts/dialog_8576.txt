VADER: The fear does not reach you. You have learned more than I anticipated.
LUKE: You'll find I'm full of surprises.
VADER: And I too.
VADER: Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
LUKE: No!
VADER: There is much Obi-wan did not tell you. Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
LUKE: I'll die first.
VADER: That won't be necessary.
VADER: All too easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
LUKE: Time will tell.
