Working 40 hours a week in HS vs College
Hello, currently I work a litte over 40 hours combinee each week with both my part time jobs, I can handle this and Highschool with good grades, but I was wondering is it plausible to go to College with let's say 12 credits and also go 40 hours a week. Is that too much or would I need to work more? Im trying to work as much as possible because I will need money to pay for college, I go up to 60 hours a week when I have spring/winter breaks.
