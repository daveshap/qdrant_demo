How to quit graciously
I’ve done a lot of thinking over the past few weeks and I think I’m ready to say I’m going to quit my PhD program. What I want to know is how to do it graciously so I do not burn a bridge professionally with my advisor, given all that he has invested in me as a student. Others who have quit- what advice do you have on what to do/not to do? 

Context: I did my MS with the same advisor, and am currently about a year into my PhD program in engineering (starting off taking classes only part time). We have a good relationship and I think he is a fair, level-headed professor and I respect him. I failed my first try at 2/3 qualifying exams and am scheduled to re-try in late June. We submitted a couple proposals for research funding this year, but they have not been approved yet and I think I could pull mine out of consideration without too much trouble. My advisor and I have put a lot of time into creating these proposals, which is why I fear I might burn a bridge by quitting. Also, given that the university is closed, I would have to tell him over video chat, which might be unprofessional. 

Reason for quitting: I have many, from change of career goals to realizing I do not like or want to be involved in academia, ever. Mainly my career goals changed after being in industry for a year and I realized to get the type of job I see myself growing into I don’t need a PhD. I was left with the only reason to stay in the program being “call myself Dr.” which for me was not enough motivation to dedicate the next 3-5+ years of my life to a program.
