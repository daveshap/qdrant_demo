Thoughts on keeping your LinkedIn updated while you’re working at a company?
TL;DR: coworkers are cracking jokes and judging me for marketing myself on LinkedIn. It’s become pretty obvious that I’m doing it because I’m looking for another job. What are your thoughts on keeping your LinkedIn up to date while you’re currently working at a job?

I’ve been at my current company for about a year now and I’m looking to relocate to a new city and find a new job there. Of course, nobody at my current company knows that I’m trying to find a new job, but I’ve been doing everything I can to make myself a better candidate in the meantime.

I’ve been updating my LinkedIn and trying to make myself more marketable by adding a professional looking headshot as my profile picture, updating my work experience with some bullet points about my work, and writing a cheesy bio about my skills and what I love about my industry. Also I’ve been getting some certifications through LinkedIn learning and adding those to my profile as well.

Some of my coworkers have seen the changes on my LinkedIn and tease me about it. They make jokes about how it’s suspicious that I’m putting so much effort into branding myself and they hint that I’m trying to leave the company. It’s really starting to get annoying. Yeah, I am branding myself because I’m looking for a new opportunity, but they have such a negative and condescending tone about keeping your LinkedIn profile up to date. They make it seem like anyone who cares about their LinkedIn image is a traitor to their current company.

I think that’s really annoying because now that I’ve taken time to update my LinkedIn, I realized this is something I would do even if I wasn’t considering leaving my current company. If you’re in any type of career, your public image is so important now that the internet plays a huge role in everyone’s lives. Any single person you meet can take 2 minutes to look at your LinkedIn and learn a lot about you, and I think that’s really underrated. 

I hate how I am being judged so negatively by my coworkers for updating my LinkedIn and marketing myself as best as I can. Yes, I admit they’re right about me doing it because I’m looking for other opportunities, but i don’t think updating your LinkedIn in general for the sake of keeping your career progression up to date is such a bad thing. It’s such a taboo subject in the workplace and I really don’t think it should be.
