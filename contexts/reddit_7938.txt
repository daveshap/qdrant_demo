Receving payment for an hourly RA position
So I posted about a month [back](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/dht5lx/wage_expectation_for_a_graduate_hourly_lab/) about an interview going well and have finally received follow up.

I was invited to a meeting with all of the staff, (asked to bring food) where a prospective new lab manager was being brought in to hear about the staff research projects etc. The PI introduced me as a grad student hoping to develop my own project for my capstone and my interest in their research, noting that I would like to be paid (previously discussed the availability of an hourly tech position with the PI).

The meeting went well, but I was told to single out researchers I had an interest in working with. A few awkward anxiety-inducing conversations later, I was asked to help work on a project as an assistant learning from the new PhD brought in. I went out sampling today for about an hour, but I am unsure how to ask about payment moving forward? I want to be as nice as possible but I need to start making money...

Edit: Also do not want to be taken advantage of most importantly.
