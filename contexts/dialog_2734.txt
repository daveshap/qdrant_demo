RODERICK: Charming Schuvaloff.
RODERICK: Black-eyed Sczortarska.
RODERICK: Dark Valdez.
RODERICK: Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
VALDEZ: Yes. He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
RODERICK: And he doesn't care about me?
VALDEZ: He is only curious to know who you are.
RODERICK: If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
VALDEZ: He loves me, as I love you.
RODERICK: Will he wish to know the details of this night?
VALDEZ: He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
RODERICK: Tender Hegenheim.
