Website with a collection of sci fi stories set in the same universe; powerful AIs being regarded as Gods, one named Gaia, and a \"technopocalypse\" There is a site with lots of stories all set in a future with super powerful AIs regarded as Gods, the most powerful being matrioshka brains. They have a specific terminology but I can't remember their names. Earth has been converted into a similiar godlike computer called \"Gaia\" and has expelled all humans creating a dystopian exodus across the solar system. And something about rogue Von Neumann machines causing a huge crisis dubbed the \"technopocalypse\".
