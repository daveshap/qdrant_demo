LT: The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
ARIANE: I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
LT: What's to believe?
ARIANE: That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
