I often fantasize about what others would do if I ended it
I imagine my teachers talking to my classmates about how I was found hanging in my room. I imagine people finally realizing that I wasn't just having a few bad days, that me saying "I want to kill myself" everyday was real. I imagine the utter sadness and horror people would experience knowing that I'd done it. I feel like I get closer every day. Every molecule of my very being is begging for the end, and I don't think I can keep holding them back for long.
