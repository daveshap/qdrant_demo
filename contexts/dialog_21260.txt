DICK VAN DYKE: So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
DAVID: I can't.
DICK VAN DYKE: What?
DAVID: Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
DICK VAN DYKE: Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
DAVID: Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ..."
DICK VAN DYKE: I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
DAVID: Re-runs?
DICK VAN DYKE: Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey. ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
DAVID: Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just cookies" after all ..."
DICK VAN DYKE: Excuse me?
DAVID: Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
DICK VAN DYKE: BUD.
DAVID: Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
JENNIFER: What's wrong?
DAVID: Nothing.
JENNIFER: Nothing?
