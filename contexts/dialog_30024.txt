GRACE: Bobby? What the hell's the matter with you?
BOBBY: I ... nothing. I just stubbed my toe on a rock. Hurt like hell.
GRACE: I got the money all packed. I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away. Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
BOBBY: Good thinking. What's all this?
GRACE: I'm not coming back.
