MIRIAM: You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
DANNY: A forty-five.
MIRIAM: It was a nine millimeter.
DANNY: You're lying.
MIRIAM: So are you... But they'll believe you.... Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house. Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
DANNY: I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
MIRIAM: All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
DANNY: But I wasn't.
MIRIAM: And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
DANNY: I can't say that.
MIRIAM: Think about your father. Your sister.
DANNY: The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
MIRIAM: Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
DANNY: Fucking kike.
