KIP: Will you come with me?
HANA: Of course. When?
KIP: I mean home. India.
HANA: Kipâ€¦ I -
KIP: I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
HANA: Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think?
KIP: It's what I've learned.
HANA: I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin. And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can. A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
HANA: I've clung to you. I've clung to you. Kip. Life a raft.
KIP: Then come with me.
HANA: I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
KIP: I'll always go back to that church.
HANA: So one day we'll meet.
