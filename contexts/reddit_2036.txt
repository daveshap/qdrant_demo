Got my community college acceptance letter
I wasnâ€™t exactly to thrilled when I read it. But my Mom was. Her eagerness that I am able to go to college made me feel warm. I made some horrible mistakes in the past but I will honestly try to make my self a better person academically and socially when I start. I will be taking the ACT tomorrow in hopes of being eligible for a state funded scholarship.

Edit: Just came out of the testing room and I am amazed by all the messages you sent. Thank you so much!
