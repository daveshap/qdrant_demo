ROBERT: I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
ANNIE: Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her. I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
ROBERT: What if she doesn't want to go?
ANNIE: She will if you think she should.
ROBERT: And you think it's best if I don't come.
ANNIE: No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
