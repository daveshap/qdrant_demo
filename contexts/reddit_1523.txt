Deleting instagram has helped my anxiety immensely.
A few weeks ago i was on instagram and feeling very stressed out and anxious for some reason and the quote from Theodore Roosevelt  “comparison is the thief of joy” came into my head. So on a whim i just decided to delete instagram and it was almost instantly i felt a relief. Im still not quite sure what it was but it has definitely helped and i only reinstall it on Saturdays for football updates. Not saying this is a general thing that will help everyone but it’s definitely helped me.
