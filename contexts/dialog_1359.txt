INSPECTOR: I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
CLUETT: Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
INSPECTOR: Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
CLUETT: That's very simple. I was home.
INSPECTOR: That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
CLUETT: Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
INSPECTOR: Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
CLUETT: If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
INSPECTOR: Oh!
CLUETT: You understand?
INSPECTOR: Why, of course.
