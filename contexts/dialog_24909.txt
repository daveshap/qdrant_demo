BREEZE: Sorry about your loss.
THEO: I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
SID: You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
THEO: So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.

BREEZE: Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
SID: Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
SID: She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
BREEZE: Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
SID: Think he bought it?
BREEZE: I'd buy it!
