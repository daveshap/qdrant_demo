LAURA: No. No. Mom wants you to come to the funeral. It's on Friday.
ROB: Me?
LAURA: My dad liked you. And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know. I don't really understand it. I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on. It's like... He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
ROB: Do you want me to be there?
LAURA: I don't care. As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
LAURA: Look, are you coming or not?
ROB: Yes, of course.
LAURA: Liz'll give you a lift. She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob. I've got too much to do.
ROB: Sure. I'll see you on Friday.
