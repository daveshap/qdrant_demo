Where can I find 100% remote W-2 employment?
Due to a sudden unexpected situation, I need a work-at-home position. I am aware of the various crowdsourcing sites and fee-for-service opportunities like online teaching, but I need W-2 employment. I don't need to make a large salary. I'm old though, and I don't even know what sorts of companies do this or where to start. Google searches of remote work of course bring up mostly crowdsourcing sites or scammy things. If it's helpful, I have a master's degree in a healthcare field and one in an education field, along with decades of work experience that involves decision-making skills, writing, editing, etc. I would work in pretty much any field that would hire me. Anyone have any suggestions?
