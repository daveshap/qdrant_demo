Why aren't people dating?
I think it's so interesting.  So many if my friends, normal good looking social people have never had relationships or been on dates.  Apparently 15 yo's in the 90s are more likely to have been on a date than 18 yo's today.  People are getting married later and later and a lot of the times not at all.  What shift in society happened as of recent?  Is it good bad or neither?  What do you guys think
