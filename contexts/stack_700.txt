automake according to Ubuntu Software Center Following description can be found in Ubuntu Software Center (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) for Automake package:<blockquote>  Automake 1.15 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake  1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11 and 1.14 did, so previous versions are available as separate packages.</blockquote>Few questions arise from this:Why are versions 1.12 and 1.13 not mentioned in the list?Fact that 1.15 fails to work in a number of situation - is this a problem of Automake or integration-in-Ubuntu's one?Description mentions previous versions are available as separate packages - where is that availability, GNU or other automake distribution servers or Ubuntu packages distribution system?
