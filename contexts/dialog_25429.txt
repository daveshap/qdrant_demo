GEORDI: I have the silo, sir. Bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
PICARD: Let's go.
BEVERLY: Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
PICARD: We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
BEVERLY: Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
PICARD: Yes...
BEVERLY: But he's been dead for three hundred... Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
PICARD: I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
BEVERLY: Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
