ROSE: Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
MS. FARMER: I think we've all seen Bonanza"."
GRETCHEN: So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
DONNIE: No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
GRETCHEN: My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
DONNIE: It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
GRETCHEN: So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
DONNIE: No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
GRETCHEN: And you'd never been there before?
GRETCHEN: Donnie?
DONNIE: Yeah?
GRETCHEN: Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
DONNIE: Why?
GRETCHEN: Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
