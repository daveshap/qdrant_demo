AMY: No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead. You be the friend who comes to see me. I'll show you my children.
IRENA: Your children?
AMY: My dolls. We can pretend.
IRENA: All right, Amy. Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
AMY: Yes, winter's coming. I don't like the winter,
IRENA: Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
