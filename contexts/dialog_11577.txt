DRIVER: Open up! We hear you got a riot.
CARETAKER: Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
DRIVER: Deputy sheriffs.
CARETAKER: Got a warrant?
DRIVER: We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
CARETAKER: Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot. Look for yourself.
