Wanting to go to trade school but I'm in University
Hey, so I'm currently in a business program in school, just finishing first year, and I enjoy it but I feel like my heart lies somewhere in the trades. I always loved doing things with my hands and such and I can see myself really enjoying being an electrician or plumber. 

My problem is my family wants me to complete my Bachelor's and I've already committed to it. Also people have told me my body will give out after some time.

Would it be wise to complete my business degree and then just go into the trades afterward? So I have a cushion for when I'm old and fragile lol. Keep in mind I am 19, and would be 22 once I graduate.

I know this might seem stupid but honestly I just want to know what people think. Thanks guys.
