I always feel bad about conversations after the fact
I feel that I can have conversations with people just fine but afterwards I always regret the way they go. Today I ran into a friend and we chatted for 15 minutes or so and I thought our talk went great (she seemed to be happy with my presence and the conversation flowed well) until after the fact. Now I have intrusive thoughts like “I should have asked her more about herself instead of talking about me the entire time”, “I should have said this but I didn't”, “Did I say anything that upset her?” and “Was my body language off-putting?” Worries like these keep me up at night because I don’t know if these thoughts are the truth or just fabrications from my overthinking. Because of these worries I constantly imagine how my conversations could have gone better. I just wish I could know how people truly think of me because I feel like people put on a fake smile when I’m talking to them when in reality I bore them, annoy them or weird them out.
