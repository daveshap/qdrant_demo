SAL: Yeah, do you know 'em?
MOOKIE: No, just checking.
MOOKIE: Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
TINA: What took you so long? Is it hot?
MOOKIE: Hot. Hot.
TINA: Come in then.
MOOKIE: Tina, you are too slick.
TINA: How else was I going to get you here? I haven't seen you in a week.
MOOKIE: I've been working hard, getting paid.
TINA: Where's the ice cream? The HÃ¤agen- Dazs butter pecan?
MOOKIE: Shit! I forgot.
TINA: Your memory is really getting bad.
MOOKIE: I just forgot.
TINA: And I really wanted some ice cream too.
MOOKIE: I can run out and get it.
TINA: No! No! You won't come back either.
MOOKIE: I can't be staying long anyway.
TINA: How long then?
MOOKIE: Long enough for us to do the nasty.
TINA: That's out. No! It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
MOOKIE: A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
TINA: You a blue-moon fool.
MOOKIE: Then we'll do something else.
TINA: What else?
MOOKIE: Trust me.
TINA: Trust you? Because of trusting you we have a son. Remember your son?
MOOKIE: Trust me.
MOOKIE: I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
TINA: Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
MOOKIE: Why you gotta curse?
TINA: I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
MOOKIE: No rawness.
MOOKIE: Tina, you're sweating.
TINA: Of course I'm sweating. I'm burning up. It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
MOOKIE: Lie down, please.
