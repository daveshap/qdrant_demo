Trouble with a friend
I had someone I considered a close friend and coworker, for almost a year. After a while I developed feelings and tried to bury them and did a relatively good job, but I’m not sure if my judgement is skewed because of it. 

She’s called me her best friend, which I’m okay with just being friends, but has put me down by saying my pain doesn’t matter. She made an excel spreadsheet to prove that I didn’t care about her. It was extremely hard to handle that, given I had tried so hard to be there for her. Eventually, one day I told her she’s my best friend to which she said I’m not her’s. Mind you, for absolutely no reason. 

I became emotional after that point and lashed out, calling her both a bitch as well as manipulative. I apologized after, but I’ve been getting the cold shoulder for a while now.

I don’t know if I overreacted from my feelings, or if I’m just a terrible person for saying those things to someone I genuinely care for. She’s not healthy and I understand that to a degree, but it still doesn’t stop those things from hurting tremendously. 

I wish I could just not care. I really wish I could shut my brain off.
