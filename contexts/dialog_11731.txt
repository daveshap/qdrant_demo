ROBERT: I don't understand. You just said he said no.
ANNIE: He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
ROBERT: That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
ANNIE: Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
ROBERT: NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
ANNIE: I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
ROBERT: You've already made arrangements!?
ANNIE: No. I was just researching. Calm down.
ROBERT: I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
ANNIE: I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
ROBERT: You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
ANNIE: He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
ROBERT: What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
ANNIE: I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
ROBERT: No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
ANNIE: Why?!
ROBERT: Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
ANNIE: I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
ROBERT: Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
ANNIE: I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
ROBERT: I'm not pretending anything!
