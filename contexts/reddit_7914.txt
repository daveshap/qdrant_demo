Any faster way to input data into the ASA-24 survey?
My research project involves myself and two other graduate students to input a three day food log into ASA-24. It asks for three consecutive days which means that after I put in the first day of food I have to wait until the next day to input the next day of food.  We have to use this program so Is there a faster way to do this? Or maybe a shortcut I could do to make this process faster? Itâ€™s so tedious and time consuming!
