Traveling jobs or relocation Jobs ?
I'm only 18 years old, kind of bored at home and with my life in general. I would really love to travel around the US, out of the country, really anywhere and willing to do any type of job. I had 2 pervious jobs in Fast Food but quit them one due to me moving, and other due to manager lying about position. Haven't had much with finding other work since then. 

I was looking into cruise ship jobs or flight attendant jobs but couldn't find much, I also speak fluent Spanish as a second language and have my Passport ready. Looked into peace corps but it seems they want people with experience or degrees.

I also have cousins in Costa Rica but by looking up jobs laws I wouldn't be able to work for any companies there unless I was paid by a company abroad or something like that. But opens to any ideas/suggestions.

Pay isn't really important to me as long as airfare is covered or discounted. Ok with volunteering as well as long as there is a allowance and airfare is free or discounted.

I have about $1,000 cash to my name to support my self too.
