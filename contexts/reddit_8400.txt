Does the footage of Daniel Shavers' killing point to a need for stricter gun control?
[Video was released recently](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/10/us/arizona-jury-acquits-ex-cop-of-murder/index.html) of the final moments of Daniel Shaver's life, a Texas man who was shot dead by Mesa, AZ police while sobbing and begging for his life. In it, Sergeant Charles Langley [barks a series of commands at the 26-year-old Shaver] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/12/08/graphic-video-shows-daniel-shaver-sobbing-and-begging-officer-for-his-life-before-2016-shooting/) including, at various times, to shut up, lay down prone, cross his legs, put his hands straight up, and crawl forward. A clearly terrified Shaver appears to be attempting to comply with the orders but is admonished several times including being told at one point  “you do that again, we’re shooting you. Do you understand?” Though, in retrospect, it's not at all clear Shaver understood what "that" was referring to.

After a series of commands that lasted nearly five minutes ([during which observers suggest the police had several opportunities to cuff Shaver and end the stand-off](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/8/16752914/police-arizona-philip-brailsford-daniel-shaver)), Officer Phillip Brailsford interpreted a gesture from Shaver toward his wasteband to be aggressive, and shot him five times, behavior which resulted his [leaving the police force](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2017/12/06/trial-ex-mesa-arizona-cop-shooting-nashville-native-heads-into-deliberations/926217001/) but, nonetheless [did not lead to his conviction of the subsequent murder charge](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/mesa-breaking/2017/12/07/philip-brailsford-verdict-daniel-shaver-killing/927052001/). This result has been [roundly criticized on the left](http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2017/12/daniel_shaver_police_killing.html), and [the right as well](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/454504/police-murder-daniel-shaver). The [vast majority of responses from observers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=daniel%20shaver&src=tyah) express horror at the act itself or how harshly Shaver was treated prior to the officer opening fire or both.

A commentary from a fellow officer (in a different police department) on the Blaze acquiesces to the notion that [Brailsford committed a crime (though he insists manslaughter and not murder is the more appropriate charge)](http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/12/14/commentary-im-a-law-enforcement-officer-what-happened-to-daniel-shaver-was-a-crime), but says that much of the behavior prior to the shooting itself was justified and complied with general principles of how police should handle such a circumstance. However, other onlookers have pointed out that [Shaver indicated multiple times his desire to comply](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-mesa-arizona-police-shooting-20171208-story.html), responding, at one point, “I’m trying to do what you say." The events that unfolded have been described by some onlookers as [an avoidable execution](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/11/opinions/daniel-shaver-shooting-opinion-gagliano/index.html). Other observers have added that the police were, from the outset, [armed, hostile, brusque and perhaps most importantly, made no attempt to and indicated no desire to, de-escalate the tension of the situation](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/a-police-killing-without-a-hint-of-racism/546983/).

Irrespective of one's opinion of this case, this is an instance of the state taking a life when the suspect in question was unarmed, and, in retrospect, [had likely not even committed a crime](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/a-police-killing-without-a-hint-of-racism/546983/). The Huffington Post, after the video, has asserted one possible policy remedy for preventing occurrences like this in the future: [disarming the police](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disarming-the-police-would-have-prevented-daniel-shavers_us_5a3438a4e4b02bd1c8c6069c). Other work, by Aaron Kovisto in the American Journal of Public Health suggests the more effective remedy may point the other way: [police shootings are less common in jurisdictions with stricter gun control](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2017.303770). This implies incidents like the one involving Shaver would be less common (possibly far less common) if police were not forced to assume that nearly every suspect they encounter were armed with deadly and easily hidden weapons. In other words, [if scared police officers are scary](http://reason.com/archives/2017/12/13/scared-cops-are-scary), perhaps society should take steps to make sure police officers are operating in a less scary environment.

This post takes as a given the notion that police shootings of unarmed citizens is a serious public problem. As such, given that premise, does a policy response that disarms or reduces the armaments of police officers and/or civilians make sense to reduce police shootings of citizens? If not, why not? Would other responses to this issue be more appropriate or more effective? If so, what?
