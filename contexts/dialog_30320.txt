SCOTTIE: Hello.
ELSTER'S VOICE: Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
SCOTTIE: No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
ELSTER'S VOICE: What happened?
SCOTTIE: She... went into the Bay.
SCOTTIE: Hello?
ELSTER'S VOICE: Did she hurt herself?
SCOTTIE: No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
