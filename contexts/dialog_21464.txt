MAN IN BLACK: Let me explain-
VIZZINI: -- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43.
MAN IN BLACK: Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
VIZZINI: There will be no arrangement -- -- and you're killing her!
MAN IN BLACK: But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
VIZZINI: I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
MAN IN BLACK: You're that smart?
VIZZINI: Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
MAN IN BLACK: Yes.
VIZZINI: Morons.
MAN IN BLACK: Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
VIZZINI: For the Princess?
