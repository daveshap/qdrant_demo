HUNK: Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch. Think you didn't have any brains at all.
DOROTHY: I have so got brains.
HUNK: Well, why don't you use them? When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place. Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble. See?
DOROTHY: Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
HUNK: Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
HICKORY: Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
DOROTHY: Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
HICKORY: Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
DOROTHY: This?
HICKORY: Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
DOROTHY: Oh!
HICKORY: Who did it? Now wait a minute.
DOROTHY: Hickory!
HICKORY: Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
