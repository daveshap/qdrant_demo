LILY: Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so. Nice car. How's that place?
MUMFORD: It's a pretty piece of land.
LILY: And the Brocketts?
MUMFORD: Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
LILY: It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard. Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
MUMFORD: ...And?
LILY: Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful? You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
MUMFORD: Why do you watch?
LILY: No gentleman caller, Doc. Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening.
