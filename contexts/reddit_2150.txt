I am an idiot....
At fam dinner and I ask my cousin who I haven’t seen in a couple years where he is applying for college. He said he got into Harvard. I laugh and a couple minutes later I ask again. He actually got in.... 


Edit: 1000 upvotes and I’ll hit him with the “stats?”

Edit 2: my “stats?” Flair is gone and I’m so sad it was gnarly

Edit 3: he got an 800 on the English section of the sat but idk what he got for math. #1 in class private school
