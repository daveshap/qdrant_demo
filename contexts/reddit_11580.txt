I know I should be thankful for what I have, but I’m just always so sad.
Real first world problems here, but I just wanna get this off my chest and get some advice. I’m a junior in high school. My grades are a mix of Bs and As but my school has such high standards that I feel like shit every time I look at those Bs. I have a long time case of social anxiety and so many good friends I had has left me. My sleep schedule is messed up (like an owls) and every single fucking thing is revolved around college and I just can’t stand the pressure. I want to do well in life but I know that means stepping out my of comfort bubble and pursuing my dreams but my anxiety has gotten so bad that I feel like giving up. I know this is wrong but I’m always comparing myself to others and it sickens me. I spend so much time hating on good people just because they achieved more than me. I’m just rambling on at this point but Please help, I just want to be happy.
