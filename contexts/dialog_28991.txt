BRETT: Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
DENBY: No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
BRETT: She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
DENBY: I would--but our rehearsal starts right away. Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
