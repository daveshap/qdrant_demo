MRS. AUBREY: Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
CHANCE: Oh, yes.
MRS. AUBREY: Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
CHANCE: Yes, I have seen that show on television.
MRS. AUBREY: Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
CHANCE: Yes. I would like to be on that show.
MRS. AUBREY: Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice. ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?

PRESIDENT: I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man.

KAUFMAN: Right, Chief.
