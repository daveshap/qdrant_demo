Why is cat spelt with a 'c' while kitten is spelt with a 'k'? On the one hand I would expect these words to come from the same roots, and yet one is spelt differently from the other.<br>I've encountered this phenomenon in a few other words as well (revoke and revocation come to mind).<br>Is there a specific, known, etymological reason for this apparent discrepancy?The relevant etymology page on wikitionary does not mention the issue, and I've turned up two possibilities while searching the web:Due to the succeeding 'i' the pronunciation of \"citten\" would not agree with that of \"cat\hence \"kitten\" is used.\"Cat\" originates from the French \"chat\" while \"kitten\" originates from the German \"Katze\".The first option is interesting, but seems rather artificial to me, and not part of 'organic development of language'. It would make perfect sense if the spelling was deliberately designed to adhere to the above rules, but I am unfamiliar with any references which may confirm this.Regarding the second option, it just seems like a very specific guess. It is believable enough, but I could find no evidence relating to this hypothesis either.
