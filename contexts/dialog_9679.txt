PARRY: Tell me more. I want to know everything.
LYDIA: There isn't any more to tell.
PARRY: Don't say that.
LYDIA: No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
PARRY: Well, it's enough for me.
LYDIA: You don't have to say that.
PARRY: I never say anything I have to.
LYDIA: I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
PARRY: What are we about to do?
LYDIA: Well... you're walking me home. I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
PARRY: I don't drink coffee...
LYDIA: ... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning... ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
PARRY: I don't drink coffee...
LYDIA: And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch. Why am I putting myself through this? It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
PARRY: Excuse me...
LYDIA: Listen, I'm not feeling well.
PARRY: Well, no wonder. We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
LYDIA: Listen, you're very nice... b...
PARRY: So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now... ... I'm not coming up to your apartment. That was never my idea.
LYDIA: Oh... You mean you don't want to.
PARRY: Oh no, I want to. I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night. I have a confession to make?
LYDIA: You're married.
PARRY: No.
LYDIA: Divorced.
PARRY: No, I...
LYDIA: You have a disease.
PARRY: Will you stop!... ... I'm in love with you...
PARRY: ... It's not just from tonight. I've known you for a long time. I see you come out of work every day. I walk with you to lunch. I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in... I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore... ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you. I love you. I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss. But I'll be back in the morning. And I won't be distant. And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
LYDIA: Shhh...
