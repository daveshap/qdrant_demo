Wife's stepcousin shot his wife and himself
So yesterday my wife told me that her cousin put 3 bullets in his wife and then killed himself with the same gun. Apparently she might have been cheating and this is how he handled the situation... very poorly. They just had a baby less than a year ago and we're very close in age to my wife and I. Last I heard the wife survived and is in critical condition... I cannot imagine what my wife's uncle is going through. I truly hope the mom pulls through, so that poor baby will at least have one parent. I lost my father to suicide a decade ago, but this is just pure insanity...
