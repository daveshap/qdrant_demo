DICK: Get the fuck outta here!
CLARENCE: I'm a married man.
DICK: Get the fuck outta here!
CLARENCE: Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?
ALABAMA: Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
DICK: Hello, Alabama.
ALABAMA: I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
CLARENCE: Tell him we gotta go.
ALABAMA: Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
DICK: What?
CLARENCE: Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
ALABAMA: He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
DICK: Wait a minute -
CLARENCE: Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
ALABAMA: Don't eat anything.
DICK: Alabama, could you tell Clar -
CLARENCE: Ask him if he got the letter.
ALABAMA: Did you get the letter?
DICK: What letter?

CLARENCE: No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
ALABAMA: He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
DICK: Money problems?
