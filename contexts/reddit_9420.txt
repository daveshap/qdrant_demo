I just asked for what I was worth
This is a big deal for me!  I was asked to step in and pick up the slack for someone else who dropped out.  I am the only other person with that job in the organization and I said I would be happy to pick up the slack immediately for 2.25X my current rate.  That will work for me!

Weather or not they say yes or no wonâ€™t feel so good as having this understanding of my value.  So so proud of myself and wanted to share.
