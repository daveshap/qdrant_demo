HARRY: Shit. I meant the other way around.
FRANCES: Well, the studio told me not to.
HARRY: Is that why you did it?
FRANCES: Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
HARRY: You're telling me.
FRANCES: Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
HARRY: Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
FRANCES: Forget it.
FRANCES: You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
HARRY: If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
FRANCES: No, they don't, do they?
HARRY: Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
FRANCES: I don't have what they want, Harry. Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
HARRY: Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
FRANCES: But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...
HARRY: What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
FRANCES: Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
HARRY: Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
FRANCES: The hell you will, Harry York.
HARRY: Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
