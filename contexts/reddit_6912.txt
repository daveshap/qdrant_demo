Voluntary Termination
Long story short, my corporate company has requested voluntary terminations twice this year and has had two hiring freezes.

The second one came today and I am worried if this might mean layoffs for my department which is Analytics. 

Wondering if I should read the writing on the wall and start applying for new employment...
Anyone have any experience with these? Offer some comforting words/advice?
