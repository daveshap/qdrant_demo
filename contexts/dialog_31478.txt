ROSEN: Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
WALTER: I want to talk about it now.
ROSEN: We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
WALTER: Remember when you asked me what my idea of normal" was?"
ROSEN: Go home, Walter.
WALTER: Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away. That's my idea of being normal.
WALTER: Maybe this isn't a good idea.
VICKI: What?
WALTER: Us seeing each other.
VICKI: You're scared.
WALTER: I'm not scared.
VICKI: Neither am I.
WALTER: Maybe you should be.
