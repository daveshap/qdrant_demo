RADAR OPERATOR: Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
COMMANDER GILMOUR: Is it one of ours?
RADAR OPERATOR: No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite. It does have an odd shape, sir.
COMMANDER GILMOUR: What are you saying, son?
RADAR OPERATOR: It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
COMMANDER GILMOUR: Oh my God, he's back.
RADAR OPERATOR: In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
COMMANDER GILMOUR: Shut up.
RADAR OPERATOR: Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
COMMANDER GILMOUR: What's its current position?
