Asking for my job title?
Hi!

I was working for this job full time and then switched to part time/contractor. My job title is still the same as when I started. My colleagues around me have had title promotions. I think it's because I'm part time my title hasn't stayed the same. They pretty much just treat me like all their other employees except I'm working fewer hours per week. Now I do a specialized tech part of the company which is vital to the company. I'm looking to apply for some other jobs and would probably benefit for a more specialized title than the one I got starting at the company right out of graduation. Should I ask for a title change? Also, they will probably wonder why I am asking for a title change and realize that I'm applying to other jobs and I don't really want that to cross their mind right now. Thanks!
