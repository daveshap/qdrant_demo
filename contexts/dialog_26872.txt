BETSY: Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
TRAVIS: I know. I could have picked you up.
BETSY: Huh?
TRAVIS: Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
BETSY: Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
TRAVIS: No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
BETSY: You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
TRAVIS: If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
BETSY: The DMZ?
TRAVIS: South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
BETSY: That would have been quite a coincidence.
TRAVIS: You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
BETSY: Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
TRAVIS: I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
BETSY: That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
TRAVIS: Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab. I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
BETSY: What hours do you work?
TRAVIS: I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
BETSY: You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
TRAVIS: Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
BETSY: You must be rich.
TRAVIS: It keeps ya busy.
BETSY: You know what you remind me of?
TRAVIS: What?
BETSY: That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said Like a pusher
TRAVIS: I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
TRAVIS: I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
TRAVIS: Oh. Who was that again?
BETSY: The singer?
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
BETSY: Kris Kristofferson.
