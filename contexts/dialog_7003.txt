LLOYD: You think mafia hit?
PETER: Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
LLOYD: It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
PETER: Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
LLOYD: And fifth, you're dating her.
PETER: What are you talking about?
LLOYD: I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
PETER: What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
LLOYD: Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
FRIDA: Paranoia
JENNIFER: Check out what I found.
