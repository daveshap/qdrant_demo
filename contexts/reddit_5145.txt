Dealing with rejection after an interview that I thought went really well.
As the post title suggests, I just got rejected from a job that I both *really* wanted, and *really* thought I had in the bag. I've been refreshing my email incessantly since my interview on Monday, after genuinely feeling like I had put on my best performance in an interview ever. I felt like I connected very strongly with the recruiter, was able to demonstrate every aspect of my personality/experience that I hoped to, and I even received positive feedback from her at the end that she was "really impressed by my capability to learn new things."

Dealing with this rejection is harder than the rest, because it makes me question whether or not I'm good enough. When I've done my *absolute* best and **still** come up short, am I really a good, qualified candidate at all? 

It's been eating me up since I got that phone call, and I really need some advice on how to move forward, what may have contributed to the decision that was made against me, and how to focus on improving.
