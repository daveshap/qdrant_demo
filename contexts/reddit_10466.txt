Not even really depressed - Simply realized that the way reality is constructed just doesn’t suit me
I would probably kill myself if it wasn’t unfair to the people that love me. I don’t have any specific problems, successful with all the things that I do but I just don’t like doing all the things you have to do to live. I don’t like living and it’s pointless. One the one hand I cannot destroy the lives of my parents and affect my friends in such a tragic way on the other hand I hate existing, what should I do?
