LORD CHAMBERLAIN: May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
TENZIN GYATSO: Please.
TENZIN GYATSO: How big is Tibet's army?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Roughly five thousand men.
TENZIN GYATSO: Is that big?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: No. Not very big.
TENZIN GYATSO: The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
TENZIN GYATSO: Will we be in this war?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: No. This war is almost over.
TENZIN GYATSO: Will we ever be in war?
NORBU THUNDRUP: We have enemies.
TENZIN GYATSO: The Chinese.
NORBU THUNDRUP: Yes.
TENZIN GYATSO: But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
