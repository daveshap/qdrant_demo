How does the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone compare to historical nonhierarchical or anarchist collectives?
In Seattle demonstrators have [taken over a small area in and around a police station](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/12/seattle-protest-chaz-capitol-hill-autonomous-zone-police-free/3173968001/) in the Capitol Hill area.  They have dubbed it the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ).

I am wondering how this compares to some past historical examples of nonhierarchical or anarchist collectives.  A few possible comparisons:

[The Paris Commune (1871)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune)

[Revolutionary Catalonia (1936-1939)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia)

[The Ukranian "Free Territory" (1918-1921)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhnovia)

Are these comparable situations at all?  Are there more apt comparisons on a smaller scale?  If these are apt comparisons, does it provide any lessons for the demonstrators or government to use in respect to the CHAZ?
