What lessons can the United States learn from European countries in the OECD about addressing, or not addressing, income inequality?
The United States has a long history of not aiding organized labor in the fight against excessive economic inequality.  The first labor strikes were met with state-backed violence^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullman_Strike) and privately-funded mercenaries ("pinkertons")^[2](https://aflcio.org/about/history/labor-history-events/1892-homestead-strike).  The Gilded Age was an era marked by economic inequality due to prejudice toward women and non-whites^[3](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/06/the-dark-side-of-the-gilded-age/306012/) ; the changing nature of corporations and their governance compared to the nineteenth century^[4](https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Workshops-Seminars/Economic-History/hilt-060503.pdf) ; and the Supreme Court during the Lochner Era from 1897 to 1937.^[5](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5175&context=uclrev)  Even some of the first self-styled progressive Presidents like Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Delano Roosevelt had trouble pushing redistributive public policy because wealthy people who opposed such action accumulated political clout.^[6](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/06/the-dark-side-of-the-gilded-age/306012/)  Progressives of the era were concerned about the health and safety of workers that lived close to polluted industrial zones^[7](https://www.history.com/topics/19th-century/gilded-age#section_6), the safety of items bought and sold on the market (particularly food and drinks)^[8](https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/History/FOrgsHistory/EvolvingPowers/ucm054819.htm) and the degree of democratization in government^[9](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/SeventeenthAmendment.htm).  

According to the Pew Research Center in August of 2018, real wages have hardly budged in decades.^[10](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/)  Income inequality^[11](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/) in the United States is higher than the OECD average (moreso when you compare it to nations with efficient social spending and public spending to facilitate tight labor markets)^[12](https://data.oecd.org/socialexp/public-spending-on-labour-markets.htm#indicator-chart), in spite of the fact that the average hours worked per worker is higher than most other developed nations.^[13](https://data.oecd.org/emp/hours-worked.htm#indicator-chart)  

1.  Do other developed countries see a net benefit from government initiatives designed to address income inequality?

2.  What can the United States do that other nations *are not* doing to reduce income inequality?

3.  What public policy does the U.S use that other OECD nations *do not enforce* thatâ€™s empirically proven to reduce income inequality?
