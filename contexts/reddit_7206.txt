My boss sent me an email telling me that if I have any questions or need help, such requests need to go through my boss. My boss then sent an email that I found out about to my coworkers titled “Delegating to (my name).” I assume it said not to help me. How do I deal with this?
Context: My boss says I’m underperforming (not formally documented, though) because I ask them too many questions, and so I told _their_ boss that I will fix that by just asking my colleagues questions, since my colleagues all ask each other questions and whatnot. My boss gives very unclear instructions, anyway, and gets mad at me for not understanding them, so going to my colleagues allows me to learn at a much faster pace.

So I stopped asking my boss questions and just ask my colleagues now, and we’re all cool with each other and very non-political. No egos or anything.

My performance immediately shot through the roof this week. So much so that I asked my boss if there was anything I could do better, and they said “no.”

Well now they tell me I need to start going through them again, so as to minimize interruptions to my colleagues. OK...well, there’s a lot of stuff I haven’t been trained on, and my colleagues tell me to just ask them questions, because that’s what they all do anyway. But then my boss sends out this mysterious email (of which I do not know the contents) telling them something related to me.

QUESTIONS:

**Should I go to their boss to tell them that they’re doing this and that I and the team found a more efficient way for me to learn?** My boss’s boss is all about asking me what tools I need to succeed, and we agreed that me asking my colleagues for help is a good idea.
