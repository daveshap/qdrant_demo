ENID: You work at Cook's Chicken?
SEYMOUR: For nineteen years...

SEYMOUR: Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
ENID: Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
SEYMOUR: Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
ENID: Yeah, but still...
SEYMOUR: I make enough money to eat and buy old records... what more do I want?

ENID: Don't you trust me, Seymour?
