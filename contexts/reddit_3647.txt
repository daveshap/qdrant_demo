I'm shy. I'm boring. I'm "nice". And I can't help it.
I'm 24 years old and I couldn't begin to tell you how many times I've come to the internet looking for help. Unfortunately, it's never made a difference. I'm still the shy, boring, "nice" (whatever the hell that even means) guy I have always been. I'm not good at initiating, I'm not good at teasing or banter, and I don't know what to say past "hello". No I don't wear a fedora and no I don't think women owe me anything because I'm nice to them. On the contrary, I completely understand why you're not attracted to me. But damn, it's really hard sometimes when I realize I'll probably be lonely my whole life because of the way I am.
