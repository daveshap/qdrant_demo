I'm born in a prison.
my country (tunisia) is a prison, most people have depression, average salary is 800TND (300 dollars), you can't travel, you can't shop online, you can't buy games without a third party service that will buy the game for u then sell it to you for an expensive price, most internet speed limit is 8mb where i live, the most one u can find now in fancy places is 20mb

thousands of people try to run away from this through the sea to italy, knowing that they can die , but they don't care , cuz they can't find a job here anyways, they aren't living, corruption exist everywhere, if u don't know someone who can help u (for ex to get a paper you need) you won't get shit.

school system is shit, classrooms are a mess, windows broken , the bathroom doesn't have toilet seats.

and a funny thing, u can go to jail for hugging someone from the opposite sex in public, applies to kissing as well...
