ELIZABETH: What sort of task?
VICTOR: It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
ELIZABETH: What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
VICTOR: So do I.
ELIZABETH: We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
VICTOR: A month at most, that's all I ask. Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake. You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
