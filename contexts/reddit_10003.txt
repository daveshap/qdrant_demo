Impact of fraternities and sororities on students/ college campuses (survey)
I'm conducting a super short survey for one of my classes looking at people's views on Greek life and how it can be helpful or harmful to students. I would really REALLY appreciate if some people could take a few minutes to fill this out. None of this information is going to be seen by anyone but me and my professor; just using it for a short paper in my cultural anthropology class. Here's a link to it that hopefully works:

Any other comments/ opinions on frats and sororities and their social and academic impacts/benefits/drawbacks feel free to also just comment here too. I'll take whatever I can get. Thank you so much!
