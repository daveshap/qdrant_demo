Unemployed biomedical science graduate: which career path can make the most money with my degree?
I (22f) graduated in July with a 2:1 and have no work experience whatsoever in the science sector. No experience means I’m struggling to land a job let alone get any interviews. 

I’ve applied for medical lab assistant jobs but have had no luck. I’m interested in bioinformatics as well as being a medical writer but it seems I’d have to do a masters to get jobs within those fields. 

Honestly, any advice for me in regards to different jobs I could go into and acing interviews related to the aforementioned jobs would be grand.
