BUD: Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
MRS. LIEBERMAN: So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
BUD: Last night?
MRS. LIEBERMAN: All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
BUD: I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
MRS. LIEBERMAN: What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
BUD: Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
MRS. LIEBERMAN: I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky. Come on, Oscar.
