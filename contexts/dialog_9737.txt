CATHERINE: No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
BOBBY: Just give me a chance, will you?
CATHERINE: I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you... I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?
BOBBY: And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
CATHERINE: Yes.
BOBBY: That'll make you happy.
CATHERINE: I hope it will, yes. I'm sorry.
