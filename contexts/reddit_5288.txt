Co-worker is desperate to look important...
Hi everyone! 

I'm annoyed with a coworker. 

I have to go to this guy for daily tasks. But he makes it difficult.

Instead of telling me maybe 2 or 3 items to action at a time (do one then move on to the next etc) he wants to do it one at a time.

He then wants to me to come to his desk and have him 'mark' the work as I stand there watching.

He also insists on making go to his desk to request a new task and have him just talk pointleslly showing me things that are not relevant or helpful to the new task.

Rather than just telling me in one sentence or sending me an instant message of the task i.e B1. 19 he wants some sort of scenario to act like he's super senior (I'm new grad this year, he's new grad last year).

What would you do? How should I deal with this issue?
