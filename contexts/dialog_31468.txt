WALTER: What are you doing?
CARLOS: This little table is one heavy bitch.
WALTER: Cherry.
CARLOS: Huh?
WALTER: It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
CARLOS: It's a nice table.
WALTER: Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
CARLOS: Yeah. It's really nice.
WALTER: It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
CARLOS: It was a beautiful present.
WALTER: Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
CARLOS: You need a table.
WALTER: She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
CARLOS: It wasn't like that.
WALTER: Then what? What?!
CARLOS: She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
WALTER: I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
CARLOS: I know, man. I love this table too. But I also love my wife.
CARLOS: What's happening?
WALTER: Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
CARLOS: Fucking Mariners.
WALTER: Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal. How was the party?
CARLOS: What party?
WALTER: The birthday party.
CARLOS: Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty. She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
CARLOS: I've got some pictures. Want to see?
WALTER: No thanks.
CARLOS: Ah, come on.
WALTER: I don't want to see any goddamn pictures.
