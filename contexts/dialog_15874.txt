LILI: You promised!
JACK: Never.
LILI: But you did... you did!
JACK: I may have said perhaps...
LILI: Liar!
JACK: Or perchance...
LILI: It's my father, gone a-hunting. The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
JACK: Sport, indeed.
LILI: The Baron is a frightful man. They say he's an ogre. He wears a mask so none may see his face.
JACK: Blackheart. Aptly named.
LILI: Oh, fie. What about the unicorn?
JACK: Unicorn?
LILI: A promise is a sacred oath.
JACK: All right. I'll show you something sacred.
LILI: Let's rest a minute. I'm so thirsty.
JACK: Stop complaining.
LILI: A gentleman would offer water.
JACK: Only were he a fool to boot. See yon viper?
LILI: I detest serpents.
JACK: That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
LILI: What shall we do?
JACK: Be patient.
LILI: Oh, dear.
JACK: What's the matter?
LILI: I've lost my napkin. It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
JACK: I'll go search for it.
LILI: Don't leave me now. I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
JACK: I'm not its master.
LILI: The napkin will keep. I'd rather not be alone.
JACK: Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
