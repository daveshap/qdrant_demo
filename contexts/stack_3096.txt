Can you fake protons with light? I have been reading similar discussions on how protons and electrons interact, using virtual photons and such. Yet, I can find little information regarding the subject in question. Can a beam of photons posses the characteristics of that of a virtual photon in a proton-electron interaction where the electron \u201cthinks\u201d there is a proton when there is not?
