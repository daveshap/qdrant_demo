Word meaning \"regularly sampled\" I'm looking for a word that indicates something has been sampled (i.e, scientifically analyzed, measured, collected, etc.) multiple times within a span of time. Specifically, I want it to reflect \"having many samples given the amount of time\". Words that don't quite work:\"Well studied\" and \"repeatedly sampled\" don't stress this latter criterion of temporal constraint. \"Finely sampled\" also doesn't sound quite right (and doesn't make clear that number of samples vs scope of sampling is being emphasized). \"Heavily sampled\" is closer, but sounds cruder and less \"scientific\"\"Densely\" is a strange way to refer to degree/amount/continuousness of effort.Both \"laboriously\" and \"tediously\" seem to emphasize the difficulty (not the positive capturing of more info).Tediously is better and obviously is used a lot in scientific writing to emphasize \"completeness,\" but again is not what I'm looking for.
