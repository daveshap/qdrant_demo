Which Gen 5 Pokemon have viable Transfer moves when transferred to Sun/Moon? I've been looking everywhere for some kind of list like this, but so far no luck. Now that the Pokemon Bank updates have rolled out, I've started eyeing previous generations (V for now) that can still transfer all the way up to Sun/Moon.I know as generations change, some movepools change, and earlier generation Pokemon can be transferred up a Gen with the old moves intact.Looking back at older generations, what are some good Pokemon/move combos I should keep an eye out for for transferring into the current generation? I know there was a lot of talk of Machamp/Fissure from the Gen I games (hidden abilities took care of that though) - any others to keep in mind besides Gen I?
