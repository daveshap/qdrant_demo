My dad just lost his job again - how can I support him?
My dad is a highly capable man who has worked in the finance field for around 15 years. He's lost his job before and it was a stressful time for him and our family.

 I doubt I'll be able to actually help him find a job but I just want to know if you have any suggestions for how I can support him. For context, I am 17.
