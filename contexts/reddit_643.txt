Asking a girl for her number
So I asked this girl for her number. (She speaks only spanish very little english while i speak only english and very little spanish) I did this using google translate. She then wrote she didnt know how to write what she wanted to say. Was this like a friend zone? Is she trying to say she dosent like me or has a boyfriend?
