Lack of Confidence during Interview.. Help?
Hey guys, I’m here to seek for advice. I’m a fresh grad and currently I had been applying for jobs but none of them doesn’t have interest to even call me for a secondary interview. Basically, I suck on interviews. I feel like when I’m being interviewed I crumble and ran out of words to say.   
 

I need advice to overcome this.
