My girlfriend was just fired over the phone from her job of store manager. She says she’s sure it was a mistake and her boss only gave a brief reason and referred her to HR. Basically she said that she approved edited time stamps. Should she call or email HR to get an explanation or defend herself?

Is there anything she can do? She had only worked there for 3 weeks but says she was getting feedback that was was doing exceptionally well. They had taken the time to fly her across the country for a week of training, she had hired several new employees etc. It was literally her dream job and she legit put in 110%. She was completely blindsided by this. She received no warning and the explanation given to her by her manager was extremely brief and she doesn’t understand. She *thinks what happened is that an employee edited THEIR OWN time stamps and that my gf unknowingly approved it. She’s not even sure if she had the *ability* to see employee edits. I asked around and managers where I work said they’re not sure how they would see such a thing and don’t thoroughly interrogate their employees on the days they aren’t in the store to see if they worked hours they said they would. She’s so confident that she did nothing wrong that she feels like she was “set up” or something even though she thinks her boss thought she was great. 

Is there anything she can/should do? Maybe at least get a fuller explanation so she can better understand what happened?
