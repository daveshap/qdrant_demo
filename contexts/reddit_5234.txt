Can you be fired for a customer exaggerating events because they're upset?
I work at a small store in my town, I have been sniffling and itching my nose with my shoulder because of all the health and safety measures going around, I use hand sanitizer liberally and regularly because I'm a main cashier and can't go to wash my hands on a regular basis and I can't call off work over a allergies.  


An elderly woman I was waiting on got angry when I sniffled and said "Aren't you required to wear a mask?" and I told her no I wasn't, then I reached my arm up to itch my nose and she got even further upset that I did that while continuing her order.   


I got a call today on my day off from one of my managers that she had called to complain that, and I quote, "Used my sleeve to blow my nose and I had snot on my sleeve" and that she was wanting the district manager involved, which he is now. And my manager asked my side of the story which I explained to her and she said she'd relay to him.   


Can I be fired due to this woman's false accusation? What do I have at my disposal to fight her accusation? What tools do I have to fight being fired wrongly if she does get me fired?
