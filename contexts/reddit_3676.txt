Tell me about that time when you did an absolute brilliant save on a date that was becoming a disaster.
Just curious about other people's story. 

Here's mine. I was on a date with a girl and told her a story about my grandfather and I shared this joke he once told me about a specific town in the region. He used to say that the cows from that town were prettier than the women. I laughed and looked at her and she looked irritated. I asked what was wrong and she said "I'm from [that town]." I was like FUUUUCK!!!!!!! So after a few awkward seconds of absolute silence, which seemed like an eternity, I said "well, they must have the best damn looking cows in the world". Against all my expectations she laughed and we had a lovely date.
