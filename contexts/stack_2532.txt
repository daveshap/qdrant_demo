Opensource bus route planner Since I have little coding skills, I'm looking for an open source bus route planner that consumes GTFS data (That I have to create myself), All I could find was OpenRouteService, and although it has some pretty nice features, the bus routing informations are very lacking (no bus numbers, stations name, transit...), Looking for something similar to Google Transit.
