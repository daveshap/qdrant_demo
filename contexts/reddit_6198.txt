I’m beginning a new government job in a court house... looking high as a kite.
Sooo I am that idiot who wore contact lenses in the pools/ocean on my vacation last week in Miami. I gave myself the hands down WORST eye infection I think I’ve seen... in both eyes. I’m no longer contagious it just looks so much worse than it is right now. 

I called my eye doctor Monday morning and he called me in some really potent antibiotic eye drops which helped to an extent but symptoms were also coming back while on them. My eye doctor prescribed oral antibiotics on top of it on Thursday. 

Since using both antibiotics, I feel much much much better. I look *slightly* better - my eyes are still very very red. Needless to say, I look extremely high. 

I normally wouldn’t care about how my eyes look but on Monday, I begin my new job that’s a government position, in a courthouse. NOT a good look, at all. 

I’m praying that I look normal by Monday but it’s not looking like the redness will be completely gone. How do I go about explaining/handling this? 

I’m going to bring my medications with me and explain it to my boss/HR but the rest of the people I encounter.... I almost want to put a sign on my shirt haha.
