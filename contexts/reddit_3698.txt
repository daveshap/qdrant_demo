Great first date this morning
UPDATE 2: Guys!!! He responded to my text, said he liked me too, and that we should set something up soon. Thanks everyone! I will keep you updated. 

UPDATE: Wow, thanks so much everyone for your encouragement and feedback. You have me convinced that I need to initiate our next date. I plan to text him this morning and let him know I had fun. Any advice on initiating the second date would be appreciated. My schedule is going to get busy Thursday thru the first weekend in December, so I'm wondering if it would be too soon to suggest dinner one night this week. Thanks again :) This is my (27F) first time dating after a LTR and I'm trying my best. Really appreciate you all.

I just had a fantastic first date! Grabbed coffee with a guy I've been chatting with on and off for a weeks now. It was amazing. Now I know what a healthy date feels like. I felt respected and heard. I was interested in what he had to say, and vice versa. 

We work in similar fields, majored in the same thing in college, and share similar interests. We talked about travel, family, TV, work, and books. The conversation was great. We talked for about an hour and a half. I feel like we could have gone on talking all day. We both agreed that we had fun talking to each other.

I have no idea if there will be a second date. My plan from here is to sit back, reflect on how the date made me feel, and live my life. I think I'm going to let him take the lead on whether he wants to see me again.

The last guy I dated had a way of making me feel confused, desperate, and clingy. This guy made me feel like an interesting, valuable person. Even if we don't have a second date, it was a great, uplifting experience.
