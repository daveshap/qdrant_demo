LEE: I was looking for you.
ELLIOT: I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm sorry. I'm so mixed up.
LEE: Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
ELLIOT: Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
LEE: Oh, don't say those words!
ELLIOT: I-I, I'm sorry. I know it's terrible.
LEE: Why, you know the situation.
ELLIOT: I know! I-I-I-I, I realize.
LEE: What do you expect me to say?
ELLIOT: Hannah and I are in the last stages.
LEE: Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close. She'd tell me such a thing.
ELLIOT: Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
LEE: Not because of me, I hope.
ELLIOT: Oh, no, no. Well, yes! I love you.
LEE: Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah. I jus--
ELLIOT: Oh, no, no, no. It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
LEE: Why?
ELLIOT: Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
LEE: But not over me?
ELLIOT: Tch, no! We were, we were both going in different directions.
LEE: Poor Hannah.
ELLIOT: But-but, but how about you? Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
LEE: I can't say anything!
ELLIOT: W-well, please be candid. I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
LEE: Yes! But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
ELLIOT: O-o-o-okay, Lee. Okay, okay. You, you, y-you've said enough. It's my responsibility now. I will work things out.
LEE: Look, don't do anything on my behalf. I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
ELLIOT: Yes, but you, you do care about me.
LEE: Oh, Elliot, please! I can't be a party to this! I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
ELLIOT: Your guilt is because you feel the same.
LEE: Oh, please, I have to go. I have to get my teeth cleaned.
