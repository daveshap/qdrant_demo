I tell myself that I am meant to kill myself the same way a person is meant to be an actor or a lawyer or a doctor.
It just makes sense that someone with no real skills no purpose no commitments no relationships to maintain should just die. 

I feel like this debilitating depression is nature's way of saying 'you are not needed.' Like natural selection in real time. 

I sometimes sleep with a belt around my neck tightened just enough that I might shift into a bad position and cut off the blood flow to my brain. 

Just seems like it's meant to be for me.
