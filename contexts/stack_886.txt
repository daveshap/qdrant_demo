Using built-in GUI tools, how do I partition/format an empty drive (zeroed out)? so I'm trying to partition/format a zeroed out USB drive using Disks app.When formatting, it doesn't give me an option to select GPT/MBR. All I get see it an option to select filesystem. I had to install gparted to get what I want.BUT it's possible, I am doing it wrong too.Thanks!edit: command I use to zero out disk: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX count=1000 bs=1M
