JENNY: Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you. But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
MATHILDA: No?
JENNY: She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
MATHILDA: Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
JENNY: Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
MATHILDA: No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
JENNY: YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
MATHILDA: No.
JENNY: Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
JENNY: I can't believe it! Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it! And did he pass your threshold or not?"
MATHILDA: ...What?
JENNY: Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
MATHILDA: No... Not yet. He's very shy... and very sensitive.
JENNY: ...Good... But what's special in him?
MATHILDA: ...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
