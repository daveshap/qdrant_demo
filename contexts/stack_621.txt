s.m.a.r.t. data no longer available in Ubuntu 16.04 \"disks\" application I am trying to find out the spindle speed of a /dev/sdbIt is a WD Green WD30EZRX SATA / 64MB Cache ... for some reason, maybe variable speed, the spindle speed is not listed on the sticker.There formerly was located a place in the \"disks\" application to list how many times the drive had been powered on, and several other pieces of information.I un-mounted the drive, and the gears icon still did not give the option to load the s.m.a.r.t. data.I installed the sg3-utils or sginfo (I don't know why it is not responding to a \"program ?\" query, to find out all the commands that can be asked of it, because it no longer acts like it is installedsudo sginfo -g /dev/sdb<blockquote>  <blockquote>    <blockquote>      Unable to read Rigid Disk Geometry mode page (0x4) [mode_sense_10]    </blockquote>  </blockquote></blockquote>
