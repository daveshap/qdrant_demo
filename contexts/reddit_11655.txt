The Haunted House
Hi everyone, I am writing to tell you about my absurd situation.

In 2004 my parents bought an old house to renovate it together here in Italy, and to live in complete serenity, Unfortunately 10 years ago my father passed away, and 2 years later my uncle (one of my reference figures).

All this has created an economic situation towards my mother who, after 10 years, is taking a rather difficult turn.

It is not possible to sell the house at a price that can cover my mother's mortgage and in addition we cannot afford to renovate the house, which he planned to do together with my father.

The more time passes, the more the house is ruined, mold everywhere, wasp's nests, broken windows, the air conditioners have stopped working etc.

My brother and I are helping out as economically as possible, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be enough, I am 30 years old and I don't feel free to make my own life, all my thoughts and part of my money are sucked into that house, my brother because of the crisis caused by COVID-19 has recently lost his job.

I am hating that house with all my strength, which is taking away sleep and serenity from me.

I am suffering from this problem of huge anxiety attacks and I don't know what to do, there are times that I hope that house is just a bad dream.

It would be nice to be able to get rid of that house and see my mother finally happy in a small apartment she could manage, but i don't know how to do it unfortunally..

I am ashamed to talk about it even with my closest friends, luckily after years I found this subreddit to be able to let off steam.

Thank you very much guys!
