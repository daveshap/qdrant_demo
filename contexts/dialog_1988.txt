LEMALLE: Thought that door was open last night...
VIKING BOB: Quit fucking around. Get in.
NEFF: You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
ERIC: Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
NEFF: Not a damn thing. What's going on? Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
ERIC: Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
NEFF: -- Here?! Where's Wilder?
ERIC: Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
NEFF: If Corbett's men find out --
ERIC: -- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
NEFF: Jiminy Christmas. What do you want from me?
ERIC: Corbett ruined my two-way. Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
