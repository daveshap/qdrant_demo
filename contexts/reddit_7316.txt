Stressed with lack of training
I work in Software Implementation.  I have been with my new company for almost a year.  The software is very complicated and I was told I would get 6 months training at my interview, but in reality I only received 10 weeks.  They are now putting me on projects where I am implementing new customers from scratch, and I feel like I am in way over my head.  I have emailed my line manager my concerns but he hasn't done anything about it.  I worry about it every night and it's really stressing me out.  I'm thinking of calling in sick next week because I have some training to do that I know I won't be able to deliver.  What should I do?
