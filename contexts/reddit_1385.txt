Anyone have to pee a lot when they get anxious?
I think it's 100% anxiety related as when I am not in my head and stuff I don't have to pee a lot. But when I do get anxious it just doesn't stop it's like every 5 minutes and its like how can there still be fluid left in me at this point.

Wondering if anyone else has dealt with similar issues and if you have been able to solve it some way
