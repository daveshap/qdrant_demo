Congress moving to cut CBO's funding
[Non-Partisan CBO 
 is facing cutbacks seemingly in response to their analysis of recent legislation](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449864/gutting-cbo-wrong-way-get-revenge)

What I would like to know is, if the data the CBO puts out is inaccurate or deemed bias against GOP plans, has anyone put out any contrary data to dispute or prove their point? The article is suggesting that after the CBO is cut, other organizations can step up or aggregate their own findings. Is that not already possible?
