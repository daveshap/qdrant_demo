JEFFERSON: Please, sir!--come with me!
PAINE: No, Jeff--please--!
JEFFERSON: I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
MA: Hello, Jefferson.
JEFFERSON: Hello, Ma. Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
MA: Fine--
JEFFERSON: And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
MA: Certainly would, Joseph.
JEFFERSON: How's Amos, Ma?
MA: Just fine.
JEFFERSON: We'd better see.
SAUNDERS: Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
JEFFERSON: Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
