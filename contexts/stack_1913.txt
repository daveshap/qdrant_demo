A word or expression less cutting than \"obviously\" for \"in a self explanatory manner\" In a sentence of this kind, in a programming environment:<blockquote>  This construct is \"in a self explanatory manner\" not interpretable, since it raises an ambiguity over the language\u00b4s syntax which is not determinable by the language itself.</blockquote>\"Obviously\" would fit the case of a clear wrong syntax, but this one is not obvious (to (self) explain), although self explanatory (explained stating the (self) obvious).Especially, I do want to judge the explanation as obvious, without judging the mistake as obvious.As an analogy for the english language, how should I say:<blockquote>  The syntax \"You I call\" is \"obviously\" wrong since undetermined, however, the same syntax \"Answers I need\" is clearly interpretable, although \"in a self explanatory manner\" a wrong syntax, since the language by itself can not determine that Answers don\u00b4t need you.</blockquote>
