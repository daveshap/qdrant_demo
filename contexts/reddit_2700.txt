How were you guys able to land a job in a new career field w/o any experience?
Do you think it was all luck, did you know someone in the organization, or are you guys just a bunch of sliver tongue foxes?  I'm trying to break out of the retail/hospitality industry and go in to the office life, but I'm feeling a little intimidated from just looking at the job postings.
