Is mass-energy conversion contradicting energy conservation? If mass can be transformed into energy, and energy transformed back into mass, isn't this at odds with the law of conservation of energy?Because this would mean, that in theory, it would be possible to let an object fall down a certain distance, performing work along the way, then you would transform the object's mass into energy, transport the energy to a higher level, and rematerialize the object, and let it fall down again, performing work along the way?This would enable an infinite loop whereby infinite amounts of energy can be gained through the gravitational field.
