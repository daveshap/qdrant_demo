BILL: How much further?
BABY: Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
BILL: Well, yeah, kind of.
DENISE: Fuck, it's freezing.
JERRY: Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
DENISE: Oh, yeah.
JERRY: Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
DENISE: Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
JERRY: It says, records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings
DENISE: So.
JERRY: Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
DENISE: Why?
JERRY: Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946.""
DENISE: Yeah?
JERRY: These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
DENISE: So what?
JERRY: I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
DENISE: You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
JERRY: I don't... ...I just thought it was weird.
MARY: God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
JERRY: Huh?
MARY: That stupid hillbilly slut.
JERRY: Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
MARY: You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
DENISE: Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
JERRY: When?
DENISE: When you were outside with Bill.
MARY: She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
DENISE: Yeah, she said we looked queer.
