“Stop being passive”...🖕🏽
So about a hour and a half ago me and my mother was having a regular conversation about a media topic. We don’t have the same view and I stuck with my opinion and still do. She started to get mad so I just left, she then comes to me and say “stop being passive”, “idk what you think that does for you”, “I don’t know where you got that from”, “it doesn’t help you and isn’t a good look for a men”. I see myself as someone who just don’t entertain bullshit. AT ALL. I don’t see it as being passive although I can admit I don’t show emotion at all. I’m stuck on what she said I can’t stop thinking about it. Trust me I know what she said might not sound like a big deal but she knows me and she knows I’m not trying to fake a personality I’m just very laid back. What she said really pissed me off and she isn’t the easiest to talk too for the possible comments that say “just talk to her and tell her how you feel about what she said”. I seriously hate that she said that. When someone treats me wrong I tend to tell myself that in my future I will have nothing to do with them and they won’t be able to come to me for anything. She does this a lot and I try to forget it every time it happens because she has done a lot for me and has some bipolar, but this here I just can’t forget or at least right now. idk what to do.
