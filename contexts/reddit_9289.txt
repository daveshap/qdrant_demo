My bills are current for the first time in 8 years.
For the first time in eight years all our bills are current. We even put money in our savings account and filled up the fridge with not just essentials but stuff we wanted and didn’t necessarily needed. For three weeks we have groceries. 
It has been a long road for us, we’ve been through rough medical patches and unemployment. Now to build up our emergency fund and pay down our credit cards. Thanks for all the encouragement from you all, and for those of you still pushing I’m rooting for you!
