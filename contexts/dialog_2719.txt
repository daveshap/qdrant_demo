ARMED GENTLEMAN: Good day to you, young sir.
RODERICK: Good morning.
ARMED GENTLEMAN: Where are you bound for?
RODERICK: That is none of your business.
ARMED GENTLEMAN: Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
RODERICK: Not at all, sir. I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
