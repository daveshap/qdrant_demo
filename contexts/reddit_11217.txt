Please, how do I cope with my mom's death?
My mom has been addicted to crack since her teens (she is in her 40's now). Due to lack of insurance and just giving up on her health, over the past few years she has been deteriorating in front of me and my brother's eyes. Though we used to butt heads, since going off to college we have grown closer, like best friends. I don't have many friends and never grew up with any family, so Im lost on how to cope. We can't afford a funeral of any kind. What do we do with all the stuff in her apartment? How do we handle her debt? Her rent?my brother is in his last year of high school and I'm only a sophomore in college.
  I'm an athiest and believe that when she dies she will be relived of all the pain of her addiction. i suffer from severe depression and worry what effect the stress will  have on me.
I just feel so selfish worrying about the financial part of her dying. I know it's coming. She is getting sicker and sicker each day...
