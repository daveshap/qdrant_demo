NIXON: ... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al. I got soft. You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
HAIG: I know it well, sir.
NIXON: It came over from Vietnam, you know.
HAIG: Sir?
NIXON: That smell. I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter. I am that blood, General. I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
