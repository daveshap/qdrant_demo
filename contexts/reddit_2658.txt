Recruiter answer to apology email: "Can I ask why? "
I had an interview today at 3 pm but I can't make it to the meeting. So I sent an email to the recruiter, as early as possible around 8 am, that goes exactly like this:  "  
Hi Mandy,   
Hope you are well. Unfortunately, I can't make it to our meeting today.  
Do you think we could reschedule for next week?  
I'm terribly sorry if I've caused you any inconvenience. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,  
(name)"  


to which she responded, "Can I ask why? ".   
That's it, no introduction, no end, nothing.  
Am I overreacting, or is this really rude?  
How do I respond to this? Anyone have any ideas?
