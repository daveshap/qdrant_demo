SOPHIE: Can't sleep?
SAMI: No.
SOPHIE: I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
SAMI: It's not your fault.
SOPHIE: What are you doing?
SAMI: I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
SOPHIE: Sounds boring.
SAMI: It's three in the morning. Not much else to do.
