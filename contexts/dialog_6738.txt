YU: You can't die! Tell us what poison you used! You can't die! Tell us the antidote! You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
JEN: She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison. It goes straight to the heart.
LI: My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master. There is no antidote.
YU: That can't be! Everything has an antithesis! Why not this?
JEN: The antidote exists. She taught it to me. The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare. Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
LI: All right. Hurry. I will hold on as long as I can.
YU: Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu. She'll help you. Hurry!
JEN: Spare your energy. I'll be back!
