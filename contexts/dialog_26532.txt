JIMMY: You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
CLARK: I've been on the job.
JIMMY: A hot story, huh?
CLARK: It was hot, yes.
JIMMY: You and Lois, you get all the action. There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
CLARK: Lois isn't here?
JIMMY: She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
CLARK: What's she doing in California?
JIMMY: It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
