I just want a hug.
I'm 16, male, and I have no idea where I'm going.

Everyone around me wants to do something with their lives, they have their shit figured out, and they know where they want to go and what they want to do. I have no clue.

I've taken test after test trying to figure out where I'm supposed to be, but nothing fits. All I want to do is sit down and rest. 

I spend 99% of my time doing *stuff*. I'm on a competitive rowing team, I'm a straight A student, and I'm finishing up my Eagle Scout rank. All of this work, and I feel like nothing is coming out of it. I feel empty.

I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I feel lost. 

And that's only half of my issue. 

I just want to be hugged, I want someone to cuddle and talk with, but nobody's there. I want to feel like I matter to someone other than my family, I want to share my life with someone. But I can't do that. Not at this age. 

I'm just so mad about it, I feel like crying and giving up on all of it, but I know that would only make it worse.

I'm just tired of the waiting. I wish time would move faster. I wish I could figure it all out. I wish I had someone to love.

And I know it only gets worse. I can't see myself living past 20. I can't even visualize it. I'll be lucky if I get that far.

Thanks for listening, and have a nice day.

EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone who responded. It really means a lot to me that you random people would reach out to me and let me know it's all gonna be alright. You guys have helped me look at my situation a little bit differently, and though it'll be tough, I think I can make it. Again, thank you all so much and I wish you the best on your own paths.
