Updated snes9x today, it crashes when I try to open a rom now I just finished updating snes9x on Ubuntu Mate 17.04.  When I try to open a recent game, it instantly crashes, leaving with me with no error message or anything.  I tried looking at the log, but I'm not sure what I'm even looking at there.  Is there a way to figure out what is causing the error or even chosing an exact version to install (the previous version)?  I'd love to not to have to start my game over again in zsnes (unless I can figure out how to load snes9x saved state).
