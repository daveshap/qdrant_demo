BONANNO: They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
ZAMMITO: Yes.
BONANNO: What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
ZAMMITO: Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
BONANNO: We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
