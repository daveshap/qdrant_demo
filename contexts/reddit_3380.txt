Dating in 2020 is like being handed a math equation that no one has ever solved and the only people who have solved it don't know how they did.
Anyone else feel like dating in 2020 is impossible. I have been online dating since 2010 and it just continues to get worse. What's more is that people seem pickier by the minute and their lists get longer. I'm seriously starting to lose hope that I'll ever meet anyone.

Side note, why are men so threatened by intelligent women? (Stream of consciousness statement deleted)

Edit: okay clearly this side note is getting all the attention. I'll have to more carefully word my posts so as not to offend anyone. Despite the impressions given by the side note, I am not an egotistical maniac. I am by far from the best at anything and I don't think I'm better than others.
