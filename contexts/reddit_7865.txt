Data analysis with R
Can anyone point me in the direction of some good beginners tools for learning to do data analysis with R? I’ll be taking a class on it in second year but I’d like to get a bit ahead and I have a rather large data set that I really don’t want to do by hand. 

Thanks!

Edit: Thank you for all the great resources everyone. You’re all a treasure
