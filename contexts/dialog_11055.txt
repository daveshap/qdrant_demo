SENATOR GEARY: ...and the tape will be running.
HAGEN: Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
SENATOR GEARY: What the hell are you talking about?
HAGEN: We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did. No strings.
SENATOR GEARY: No strings.
HAGEN: You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
SENATOR GEARY: No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
HAGEN: Do you gamble?
SENATOR GEARY: A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
HAGEN: Do you owe markers?
SENATOR GEARY: Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
