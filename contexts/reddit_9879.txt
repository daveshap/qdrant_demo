Bystander Intervention
 Hello everyone. 

At the school where I work at we are looking to implement a violence and discrimination prevention program, so far the idea of having a bystanser intervention program has been the most popular.  On the coming days we are set to have a meeting with "SAGE Academy" about their bystander intervention training, I'm reading a paper they published about their bystander intervention program and I'm not sure if it is the right one for us. I don't know any other company that does this kind of training and so i wanna ask you a couple of things, first, has any of you had any experience with this bystander training by SAGE Academy? Second, do you know other company that does this kind of training that I can read? Thank a lot!
