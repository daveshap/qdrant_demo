Need help - New grad almost no interviews
I’ve reached a point where I’m very disheartened and confused about my job search. I’ve applied to 100 positions but only had 3 interviews (from prior connections) that resulted in stating they wanted someone to start immediately.

I will be graduating in May with a business undergrad degree from a top 20 US business school with a 3.5+ GPA. I’ve had 4 internships, two of which were at top tech companies and two others at high growth startups. I have decent leadership, several merit scholarships, and won case competitions. I thought there might have been problems with my resume, but I’ve had it looked over by two tech recruiters, my previous boss, and a university counselor and they couldn’t find anything wrong with it/ all seemed to be impressed. Yet I can’t get interviews, even where I’ve contacted recruiters over LinkedIn directly, met the company at networking events, or had a referral. 

People I ask for advice sometimes say you have great experience you’ll do fine and that’s really not helpful because I’m not doing fine in my job search. I’m tailoring my cover letter to each job and am a US citizen. What else am I not doing?

At this point I’m at my wits end. I don’t want to be making the same mistakes over and over again. Does anyone have advice on getting the interview? Also now that most new grad programs are closed what can I even apply to if I’m interested in tech.
