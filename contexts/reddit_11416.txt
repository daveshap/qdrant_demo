I finally bought that book I wanted for so long.
So I have started doing Calisthenics at the beginning of the year, but really started to train actively since March, when I lost my girlfriend and my job.

Yesterday I finally applied for a short term job, but it's something until I can (hopefully) study in October.
Knowing that I will have an income again, I bought the second edition of Overcoming Gravity. I will finally be able to train properly and it just makes me so damn happy.

I really hope it is as good as everyone says...
