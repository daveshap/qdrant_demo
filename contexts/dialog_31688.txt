CARLSON: Yes, sir.
FREDDY: He has a big mouth. Yes! It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student. But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
MEDICAL STUDENT: But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?
FREDDY: My father was a sick man.
MEDICAL STUDENT: But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor? Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
FREDDY: You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
MEDICAL STUDENT: Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
FREDDY: How old are you, young man?
MEDICAL STUDENT: Nineteen, sir.
FREDDY: Nineteen! My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
MEDICAL STUDENT: But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
FREDDY: Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
MEDICAL STUDENT: But, sir...
FREDDY: I am a scientist...! not a philosopher.
FREDDY: You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
MEDICAL STUDENT: But your grandfather's work, sir...
FREDDY: My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead! There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
