Is there such a material that only emits, or \"sends out\" the same color light that was \"taken in\" (absorbed)? For example, glow-in-the-dark materials (photoluminescent) only emit a green hue regardless of the color of the light shone on the material.Is there such a material that emits the color of the light received, or the combined colors? For example, if one were to shine a red light on the material, it would emit red, same with yellow, etc.A mirror only reflects light and doesn't absorb or emit any light.
