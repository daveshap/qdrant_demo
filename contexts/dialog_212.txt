FLOYD: Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
PILOT: There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
FLOYD: When do we arrive at Clavius?
PILOT: We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
FLOYD: Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
