Making a name an English name How does one go about taking a name (or word) from another language and making it an English name? I know of examples such as Yeshua being turned to Joshua or Yonatan turning into Jonathan, but I do not know the rule itself. Edit: To help specify my question:  I am trying to change is the Malayalam word for \"Heart\" (Hrdayarn) I want to use it as a name but it sounds just a little off.
