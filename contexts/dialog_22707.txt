WALTER: What?
MAGGIE: Just stop it. Don't say another word like that.
WALTER: Maggie, it's just a joke...
MAGGIE: No. It's my life.
WALTER: A harmless joke.
MAGGIE: No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid. I don't like it. Stop. You may not like having a daughter with problems. But guess what? I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time. I'll eat in my room.
