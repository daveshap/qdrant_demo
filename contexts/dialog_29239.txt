HARRY: How often is your wife called to help delivery?
GIDEON: It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
GIDEON: What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
HARRY: Everything these days is made overseas.
GIDEON: You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
HARRY: Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
GIDEON: I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
HARRY: Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways... ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you. It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what? I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
GIDEON: You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
HARRY: You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
GIDEON: My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
HARRY: 'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
