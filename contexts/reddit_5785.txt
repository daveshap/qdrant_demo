My job was taken away from me unfairly
Hello I have a bit of a weird situation in regards to my work. 

I've been working for a cleaning company as a cleaner for a few months. This is purely a placeholder job until I find something I want to actually do. I have been working as a casual to cover other peoples shifts. Recently I was offered to do part time for 5 days a week cleaning 3 different stations each day. I found the work quite difficult after a week of doing it and sought advice from my supervisor and that this work is making me stressed and if possible when it's available could I find an alternative shift. He said he'd talk to my manager about it. 

On this weekend I get a message from my manager saying "hey can you cover this train station shift" the problem was it was my shift and I was confused why'd she'd ask me to cover my own shift. I called her up and asked her "why do I need to cover my own shift when I've been rostered permanently for this shift?" She tells me that my supervisor told her I wanted to quit. I said thats not true, I wanted to find another shift but I didn't want to quit it until I could transfer over, and I made that very clear with my supervisor. She said "oh ok well what shifts do you want" and I told her what times and stations I'd be willing to do and she said she'd get back to me. 

What should I do in this situation? My manager didn't seem to really care or understand what I was talking about and although the shift is bad I still need to earn some money on the side.
