In light of the new trade agreement between Japan and the EU, was it a mistake for the U.S. to walk away from the TPP, and how difficult will this be for the U.S. going forward?
Japan and the EU have reached what seems to be a pretty huge free trade deal.

Some news sources have played up that this is a rebuke to the U.S., for walking away from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and UK, for Brexit. The Washington Post's story strikes me as the clearest example:

What are the impacts of this agreement on the EU and Japan, as well as on non-parties such as the other countries which signed onto the TPP before it was rejected?
