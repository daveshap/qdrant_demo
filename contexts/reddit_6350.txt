This could go into r/offmychest also. I started a new job last week..
I don't know if i have the vocabulary to describe how much i'm struggling. I mean, people have said i can do it, but my boss just went through a process with me at what felt like the speed of light, and i just sort of nodded as she was explaining what she was doing, not to mention i was 'trying' to take as many notes as possible. The process of her doing it at normal speed took around 2.5 hours. This scares me. I am really upset now because it seems like i should know more than i do. I thought i was a relatively bright person, but i do not feel like that anymore. I guess i could just say to her that i sort of understood it but there are parts i don't have a clue about, but there are 6 other people in this office who have all been working here for ages. I'm the only one who hasn't been to University for this job, but she hired me knowing that, so i guess...? Rambling now. I need some advice please :(
