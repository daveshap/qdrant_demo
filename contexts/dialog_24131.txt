COLE: You really look better.
MALCOLM: Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
COLE: You have nice red in your cheeks now.
MALCOLM: Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
MALCOLM: It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.' Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
COLE: No.
MALCOLM: What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole...
COLE: Just help.
MALCOLM: Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
COLE: You believe now?
MALCOLM: I believe both of you now. And I think I might know how to make them go away.
COLE: You do?
