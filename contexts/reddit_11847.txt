bored with life
im just bored with life and kinda want it to be over. my only friend is moving, and no one else talks to me. im getting bored with everything i do and just feel as if my life as peaked, and im done now, i wanna leave. im not really depressed to where im going to hurt myself, but if i was to die tomorrow; i think id be ok with that. i dont know. just in the back of my mind lately ive found myself thinking a lot about death and dying.
