Naming LOGSEGMENT in Oracle I'm new to Oracle DBs and I'm creating a table that contains a CLOB field for very large JSON Objects.I'm requested to name the LOGSEGMENT object of the CLOB column but I haven't found how to do it. For now, I'm just creating a table that has a CLOB column and a constraint to check that the CLOB field is actually a json. How do I name the LOGSEGMENT object?
