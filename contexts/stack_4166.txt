Paris at Easter I'm thinking of going to Paris during the Easter weekend, has anyone been before? My specific answerable questions are: Were tourist attractions such as the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre open duringthe week/weekend of Easter (any days)?Were the attractions mentioned above crowded, or were wait lines normal for the average?Are prices put up during Easter?
