ELLE: Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
EMMETT: Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
ELLE: Aside from that.
EMMETT: She's completely untrustworthy.
ELLE: Why?
EMMETT: She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
ELLE: A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
EMMETT: And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
ELLE: But maybe it's not what you think.
EMMETT: But maybe it is --
ELLE: You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
EMMETT: How do you figure?
ELLE: Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised.
EMMETT: I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
ELLE: Maybe not to your face...
