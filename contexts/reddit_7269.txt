Weird Work Environment/Internal Hierarchy Seeking Advice
I have been working as a data analyst at this company for 4 months. There was no proper training (first red flag) and I’ve been “on my own” for the most part struggling to learn. 

The weird part is most days I’ll have 1-2 hours of work tops, some days I legitimately go through the day with no tasks and leave at 5. I beg my 4 person team to give me more work and teach me more so I can help, but they’re always busy. The most senior guy on the team who is also my manager doesn’t communicate much with me and often stays till and past midnight to get work done yet never delegates to me. I also feel they know I’m sitting here doing nothing, because 90% of my work gets passed down from the team. 

I know they need me because they wouldn’t have hired me, but it really feels like it I leave there will be a huge burden put on the team. However, what is so confusing is that I don’t really do much day to day so I don’t see how this is possible from my POV but in reality they need a 4th on the team.  

I have a great salary for my position, 1 year out of college. However, I really am not learning at all nor growing as an individual because most of the company is much older than me and there’s a sit and get your work done type office vibe. 

Part of me is like wow your getting paid fairly well to surf the web, learn about real estate and Amazon FBA... milk this as long as you can. People who work 60-80 hours weeks making 10-15K more would kill for 9:30-5 (actually leave at 5) for my salary. On the other hand, I hate not doing anything and feel this is slowing down my life’s progression and know I do not want to be here long term. 

TL;DR

My small team doesn’t delegate work to me even after asking numerous times a day. I’ve almost stopped asking at this point. Any advice would be helpful.
