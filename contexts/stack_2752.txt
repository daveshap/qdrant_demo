How the velocity of the air is slowing down in different distances from a fan? Is it determined completely by the air pressure and the temperature? Do I need to take into account also the geometry of the \"air cone\" of the fan or is it determined by the speed of the air when it leaves the fan?Practically I would like to solve questions e.g. which CFM ensures a given air speed at a given distance.
