Why do HR people get so put off when you ask what the position pays but think it's fine to ask what your salary is?
This seems backwards to me. I think I'm underpaid for what I do - everybody does, I know - so disclosing my current salary puts me at a disadvantage because I know I'll be offered less than what I'm seeking. 

I've never asked anybody how much they make. I've always thought that's a rude question. Unless we're married or I'm applying for a loan from you, it's none of your business. 

Last time I had phone screener, I countered the question by asking what the salary range was. She wouldn't answer. Another time, I revealed my salary and she said the company could hire me "at a bargain." What the fuck? She basically admitted that they wouldn't pay me market value. 

Why is it accepted for recruiters to ask for your current salary? What ways are there of avoiding the question without coming off as rude?
