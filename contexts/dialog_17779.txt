YAZ: Now, what are we looking at? Keys. Look at them all. Why do we have them? Mr. President?
PRESIDENT: Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
YAZ: That's why you have doors, Mr. President. Keys, however, are to lock the doors. And locks, as you know, are to keep people out. Why? Fear. You humans are afraid. So you set up boundaries. Borders. Your car. Your home. Your country. All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you. Well I am here to let that enemy go. Because there's a border you didn't even know existed. It's the border to the Universe. And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you. It was set up by others, to keep you away from them. Until now. Because I have been sent here to open the door. To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
YAZ: Why, you might ask? Because you're ready. Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
PRESIDENT: If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
YAZ: A good question. And a simple answer. No more hunger. No more smog. No more overpopulation. No more war.
PRESIDENT: And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
YAZ: That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN. Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup. We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
KAY: Pardon me. I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have. How is this going to help?
YAZ: How could it not?
KAY: Why don't you ask the Mosebacke? Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork. Today, they don't exist.
YAZ: Come on now. People are smart.
KAY: No-- a Person is smart. People are dumb. And the more people you put together, the dumber they get. And you know that.
