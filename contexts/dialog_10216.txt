RICHARD: That's what you think?
SETH: That's how you're lookin', Richie.
RICHARD: I'm lookin' scared?
SETH: That's what you look like.
RICHARD: You know what you look like?
SETH: No, Richie, what do I look like?
RICHARD: You're lookin' green.
SETH: How?
RICHARD: Where are you right now?
SETH: What do you mean?
RICHARD: Where are you?
SETH: I'm here with you.
RICHARD: No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
SETH: My shit is together.
RICHARD: It don't look together.
SETH: Well, it is. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're just not used to seein' me happy, 'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin' years since I been happy. But my shit is forever together.
