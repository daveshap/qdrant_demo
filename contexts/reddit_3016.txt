Why am I being told no?
Four interviews since 1/20 and all have said no.  I am so confused. I look up questions and practice them. I show up early and I dress nice. I do a follow up if a week goes by. 


Two gave me feedback. They both said I did good and would be eligible for future hire but that another candidate fit the position better. One gave me an 8 minute interview and another was 10 minutes. Both were very basic questions. I felt like they just interviewed me because HR gave them my information. 

All four were in the medical field. I have work experience but not in the medical field. I had everything the job description required.
