Donna Brazile said the DNC's joint fundraising agreement with Hillary's campaign wasn't illegal. Does this hold water? How does US law regulate political parties anyway?
Politico released this story today:

And I'm trying to figure out how big a deal it is.

Brazile says the joint fundraising agreement between the campaign and the party "specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the partyâ€™s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings."  But not far below, she says it "was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical."

Is this true? Does the US have any regulation that governs fairness in political party nominee selection, or do the parties have total control to set their own rules?
