No one wants to deal with sad people, but get angry when they decide to do something about it.
I’ve reached out to people before and they just get hurt. They can’t handle it because it’s too much or too sad or they don’t have the time. It’s honestly fine. I understand that no one is obligated to listen to me or give me any of their time, but I know these will be the same people who will be upset if I’m gone. My sadness is so inconvenient that they’d rather me stay sad and destructive for the rest of my life than have to deal with any of it. There is no fix for my problems and I feel like it’s selfish for them to want me alive when they know just how awful I feel. They don’t have to help me, but they shouldn’t get mad when I try to help myself.

More context: I’ve also done therapy for 3 years and been on multiple meds for depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I exercise, practice self-care, and try to do my hobbies when I can pull myself out of bed. I have tried everything else to fix myself. I worked really hard just to keep falling to the same low point.
