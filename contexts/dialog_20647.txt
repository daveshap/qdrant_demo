MR. KELCHER: We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
CHARLIE: What would that be, sir?
MR. KELCHER: Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
CHARLIE: Of course.
PEGGY: Where did you get that sweater?
CHARLIE: Great, isn't it?
PEGGY: It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
CHARLIE: Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
PEGGY: Right. I promised my mother.
CHARLIE: Is this slow enough for you?
PEGGY: Charlie, how are you?
CHARLIE: I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
PEGGY: Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
