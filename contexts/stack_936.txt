Ubuntu 18.04 hangs while booting I have ubuntu 18.04 installed alongside windows 10, I've been having this issue lately. When I boot into Ubuntu after the splash screen many [ok] messages appear and it just hangs there, yet windows boot normally tho.I tried reparing packages through recovery mode but didn't work, I also chose an older kernel but still face the same problem.Kernel: 4.15.0-34- generic/4.15.0-33-genericPc: i5, 4 ram, intel hd graphics 4400
