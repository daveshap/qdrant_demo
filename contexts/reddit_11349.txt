Didn’t get either of my majors at my dream school and I don’t really know what to do...
     I have wanted to be an engineer for the best part of my life, and I fell in love with Biology and natural processes during high school, so I applied to the biomedical engineering major at the University of Texas at Austin. I thought I had a fairly decent chance of getting my major as I worked hard throughout high school and earned a rank of 9/385 + a 35 on my ACT. I also participated in various extracurriculars such as Orchestra for 7 years and playing Cricket for 6 years. 
     I found out recently that I wasn’t accepted to my main major or even my second choice (Mechanical Eng.), and to be completely honest I don’t know what to do. I have always dreamed of attending UT Austin and becoming an engineer but now I’m pretty lost and don’t know where to go with myself. I am debating going to UT as an undeclared major or another major and transferring into engineering as quickly as I can, but I have heard that can be risky and usually doesn’t happen. 
     I just don’t know where to go or where to look for answers/guidance. I am hugely disappointed and I wish that I could know where I went lacking in my application. It sucks knowing that I am not seen as good enough for something I have worked hard towards for a couple years.
