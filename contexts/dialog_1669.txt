PANES: How's the movie going? Your movie. You are making a movie, aren't you?
SALLY: Yes. Fine.
PANES: That's it? Yes. Fine?
SALLY: I don't want to talk about it.
PANES: Why not?
SALLY: I never like to talk about my work.
PANES: Alright. Well, that's something new.
SALLY: No. Not something new.
PANES: Well, something's wrong.
SALLY: Nothing's wrong. It's great, okay? Having the time of my life. Mac's a fantastic director. And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said. And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
PANES: Um. Happy for you.
SALLY: Thanks.
PANES: So tell me, how's it going?
SALLY: Oh you know. No doubts. No second thoughts. Am I a monster?
PANES: You're my best friend.
SALLY: That's not an answer, is it?
PANES: Yes, you're a monster.
SALLY: Thank you, Panes.
PANES: You don't need to thank me.
SALLY: We're going to have to go back out there.
PANES: I guess.
JEFFREY: Let me. I'm Jeffrey.
MONICA: Monica.
JEFFREY: And you know our friends, how?
MONICA: We live next door.
JEFFREY: Oh. You're them.
MONICA: Excuse me?
JEFFREY: We've heard lots about you.
MONICA: You have?
