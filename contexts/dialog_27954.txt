LOUISE: We don't need the lantern. The place has electricity.
THELMA: I wanna take it anyway. Just in case.
LOUISE: In case of what?
THELMA: In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
LOUISE: Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy. Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
THELMA: We'd have to. That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
