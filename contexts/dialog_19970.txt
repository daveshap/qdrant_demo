CHARLIE: They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
WESLEY: Half.
CHARLIE: What?
WESLEY: They paid us half. They still owe us half...
CHARLIE: There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That make a statement
CHARLIE: That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
WESLEY: I know that.
CHARLIE: AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
CHARLIE: Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional! AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
WESLEY: Worse... you're in Texas.
CHARLIE: Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
