Is 23 too old for a 17 y/o?
Currently, I (17f) am talking to a 23 year old guy I met at my summer job. I am a senior in high school and he just graduated from a four year college in the spring.  I have talked to many close friends and adults abougt the situation and everyone has had mixed feelings about it. No one yet has said he is too old. However, i’m starting to question if this will go anywhere considering where we are in our lives and the age gap. 

I have thought about bringing it up to my parents (mostly my Mom) but I’m not sure how to go about it. I can’t imagine how she’ll react so I’m looking for some ideas as to how i could introduce this idea of me being with a 23 year old.
