If I don't want a lunch break, is it weird to ask for "lunch time" to be taken off my work hours?
I never eat lunch, so I would ideally want that time taken off. Would it be OK to ask for this? How soon after starting the job would be "too soon" to ask?

Also if the boss said yes, would it be weird if I snuck in a granola bar while working if I ever did get desperately hungry?
