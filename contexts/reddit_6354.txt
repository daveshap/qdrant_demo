Job scam on online boards across US.
Sitcocommunications.com has been posting job ads across the US on multiple job listing sites including job search.com and indeed.com. I have reported them to no avail but after tracing their IP and looking up their domain they are shady. I was contacted by one of their "representatives" and of course was made outlandish claims to pay and benefits but when I asked for a physical address or number to corporate she began to clam up. Please spread the word so people do not get duped by these people. They post under sitco or sltco.
