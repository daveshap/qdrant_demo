ACE: Huh? Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
GINGER: No.
ACE: Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it? That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
GINGER: Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
ACE: What are you talkin' a- ?
GINGER: Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
ACE: You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you? Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
GINGER: You can trust me.
ACE: Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
