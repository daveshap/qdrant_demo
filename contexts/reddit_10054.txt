Spoiled/Rotten food in fridge
Hey guys

I'm in first year college and it's my first time living with other students. We live in individual rooms. 

I have 4 other roommates who rarely comes out at all except sometimes for dinner but even then they have different dinner times I. E. Med student has dinner around 7 but it's always fast food (irony) and another person always cooks as soon as they arrive home. 

There was a box of strawberries rotting in the fridge for a while now. Best Before date was 11/09. While I was hesistant to throw it out in case that this rotting strawberry was some experiment (I know only the med student, I don't know what courses the other three took), but remembered that this can be a health hazard due to spores migrating if the host has too many spores. 

What would you guys do in this scenario? There's also beef patty in the fridge that is going off at the end of today.
