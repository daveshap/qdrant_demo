MULEY: Then who *do* we shoot?
THE MAN: Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
MULEY: Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
TOM: Well?
MULEY: They come. They come and pushed me off.
