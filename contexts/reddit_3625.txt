Suggested an expensive restaurant on first date - should I just move on?
The first response from this girl is: "better discuss this in dinner", I tried: "choose your fav restaurant, dinner is on me", then she suggested a restaurant that, from what I can find in Google, it costs $600 for two person excluding alcohol...

This is weird right? Should I just ignore and move on?

\-- EDIT --

Thanks for all the replies and the guys who messaged me not to date with her. Apparently this is a scam and I'm not going out with her.
