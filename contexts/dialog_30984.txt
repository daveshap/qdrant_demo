TED: I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
MOM: Did you have a nice flight? Are they taking good care of you?
TED: Yeah, I'm doing fine. I have so much to tell you. I don't even know where to begin.
MOM: Save it, honey. We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
TED: It's okay, Mom. Trust me.
DAD: Ted, it's your dad. I have a question for you. I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
TED: Just say it, Dad.
DAD: I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
TED: Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
DAD: Well, good. Every little bit helps.
CHARLIE: Check this out. Hurry!
TED: I better go, Dad.
