NORMAN: What is it? A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
BARNES: Something like that. That doesn't surprise you?
NORMAN: Not really, no. Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret... When did it crash?
BARNES: As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
