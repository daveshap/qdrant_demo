SCHULTZ: Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
SEFTON: How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
SCHULTZ: You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can -- Silk stockings?
SEFTON: Here. Take them.
SCHULTZ: Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
SEFTON: And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
SCHULTZ: Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
SEFTON: Who's the guy, Schulz?
SCHULTZ: What guy?
SEFTON: The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
SCHULTZ: I do not want those cigarettes.
SEFTON: Yes, you do!
SEFTON: I'll make it five hundred!
SCHULTZ: No! No!
SEFTON: You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
SCHULTZ: Talk what? I do not know anything!
SEFTON: How many do you want? A thousand?
