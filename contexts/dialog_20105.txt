ZACK: You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
FOLEY: It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
ZACK: But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
SID: He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
ZACK: Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
