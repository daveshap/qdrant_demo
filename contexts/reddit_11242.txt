Pissed off a well known guitarist. Now I feel bad
Hi everyone.

So a few days ago I messaged a well known guitar shredder about some tips, and whether they offered lessons.  They do. They did say they didn't teach beginners.  We discussed my ability and rates etc.  The rates weren't too bad.  So I said I was interested and would let them know.

Here's the thing.  I have Cerebral Palsy, I play guitar overhanded with two fingers.  I've been playing for ten years but I'm really not that great.  So I figured scheduling a lesson would be a waste of their time.  I told them I really needed more beginner theory type stuff and not the skills of a shred master.  They basically said: "Fine, I teach beginner theory but if you don't want to learn from me, go ahead and take lessons with somebody else." 

I wasn't sure how to interpret that tonally, so I thanked them for understanding.  They said (paraphrasing): "Yea, I love having conversations like this all day long."

On one hand I feel like crap because I annoyed a guitarist I respected.  Maybe I did waste their time overall.  On the other hand, I had the best of intentions, and what time?  It was a conversation over FB Messenger, it's not as if we scheduled a lesson or anything, and they said no novices.

I'm just super bummed.  How should I feel here?

Thanks.
