My new employer gave me money for relocating. It’s not enough to actually hire movers, so I’m moving myself. Since I must use it to get reimbursed, I’m thinking of just using it on luxuries. Will this matter to the employer? Any other things I can use it for?
I’m thinking of staying at luxury hotels along the way and eating at only the best restaurants.
