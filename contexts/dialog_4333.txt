FRANCESCA: You ought to write these stories down.
ROBERT: Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
FRANCESCA: Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do
ROBERT: I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
FRANCESCA: Why, do you think?
ROBERT: I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
FRANCESCA: You sound like an artist.
ROBERT: No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
FRANCESCA: I don't think you're normal.
FRANCESCA: I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
ROBERT: Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on. Did you love teaching?
ROBERT: And did you?
FRANCESCA: I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
ROBERT: Why did you stop?
FRANCESCA: My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
ROBERT: Do you miss it?
FRANCESCA: I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
ROBERT: You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
ROBERT: I'm sorry. That was...
FRANCESCA: No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
ROBERT: This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
