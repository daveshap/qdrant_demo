STACY: Hey.
AVERY: Come over here.
AVERY: How they goin', kid?
STACY: Not bad.
AVERY: How'd you like to kill someone for me?
STACY: Okay.
AVERY: Same as last time -- the rest after.
STACY: Where do we go?
AVERY: When you find the guy, you'll know.
STACY: What shit is this. I just do it. I don't prepare it.
AVERY: I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone. He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
STACY: This is un-fucking professional.
AVERY: See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level. So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
STACY: Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
AVERY: That's why I'm letting you take care of this. I'm the one with appearances to maintain. But who gives a shit about you? Not even God.
