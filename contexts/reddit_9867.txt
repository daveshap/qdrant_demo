Is it Right For Me?
Hello! I've been subbed for a bit now, but finally decided to post. I'm a rising Undergrad Senior and I'm considering going into Student Affairs/Higher Education Admin after graduating. I'm super active on campus with Student Government, my campus' activity board, abd study abroad. I'm fairly active with NACA as an undergrad intern and NASPA as a NUFP mentee. I'll be doing an internship at a university's Dean of Student's office over the summer, as well as attending DLI. I do really think that I would succeed in Higher Ed. 

However, some of the SA pros at my undergrad institution disagree. I have been strongly discouraged from going into the SA field by some of my advisors. One told me that I should look into a less-people focused career as I don't have the skillset for SA, and another said autistic people like myself don't suceed in higher ed. 

This has greatly shaken my confidence. While this is something that I have a passion for, I can help but take into account what they have to say. It's tough to be knocked down when I speak to them. I'm considering backing out of the internship, changing course, and taking a less people focused job, per my advisors recommendation. I'm just unsure of where to go, so i'm turning to you reddit. Should I be putting weight to these recommendations and abandon SA or should I keep plugging along with my passion for it?
