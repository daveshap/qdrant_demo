MONICA: I'm homesick.
DELBERT: Homesick? It's only been two days!
MONICA: We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
DELBERT: Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
MONICA: How is it going to be different from this? Go see some boring footprint under glass?
DELBERT: Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends. Any chump can go to Nassau.
DELBERT: Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class. You'll be envied by everyone.
MONICA: I guess so.
DELBERT: Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
