How a VPN makes the effect of being physically in that private network? I know the basics of how a vpn works, but what I cannot get it is why if my computer is connected to a company via VPN, why my computer experience like if it was physically there in the company. I know that in reality this is not like that, but I cannot connect all of these pieces together. I would appreciate a well explained answer without copy/paste from other pages, I would really understand it. Thanks you in advance.
