JOHNSON: So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell. I'm counting on you, Reverend.
REVEREND DAWSON: I understand.
JOHNSON: Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
REVEREND DAWSON: I know.
JOHNSON: I'll talk to the Mayor.
REVEREND DAWSON: That'll make the folks very happy.
REVEREND DAWSON: It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
DUFF: Guess it's never been easy.
REVEREND DAWSON: It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
DUFF: Thank you.
REVEREND DAWSON: Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
DUFF: How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
REVEREND DAWSON: Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
DUFF: Can't live without trouble, can you? Nice place you got here. Real nice.
REVEREND DAWSON: Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
DUFF: I guess I ain't.
REVEREND DAWSON: Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
DUFF: Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
REVEREND DAWSON: I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
DUFF: I doubt it.
REVEREND DAWSON: I see. Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
DUFF: I guess not.
REVEREND DAWSON: And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
DUFF: Well, that figures. Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
