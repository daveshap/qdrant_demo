GALE: I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
DEWEY: Do you want us to come with you?
GALE: I work better alone. Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
SIDNEY: I can see nothing's changed.
DEWEY: No.
JENNIFER: Geez.
GALE: What the hell are you doing?
JENNIFER: Being Gale Weathers. What the hell are you doing?
GALE: I am Gale Weathers!
JENNIFER: Here's how I see it. I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked. Because someone wants to kill me? No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go. That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you. Make sense?
GALE: None.
JENNIFER: You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
GALE: And as a sane person. For you that must be quite a stretch.
JENNIFER: That's funny.
GALE: Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
JENNIFER: Need to get in that building?
GALE: No really?
JENNIFER: There a story in that building?
GALE: Possibly.
JENNIFER: Gale Weathers would find a way.
JENNIFER: Basements creep me out.
GALE: Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
JENNIFER: Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
GALE: Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
JENNIFER: Bitch.
BIANCA: Can I help you?
GALE: I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
BIANCA: I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
GALE: Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
BIANCA: Nope.
GALE: Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
BIANCA: Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
GALE: Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
