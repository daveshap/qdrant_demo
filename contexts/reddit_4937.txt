"depression paralysis"
how do I explain to my parents about what I like to call depression paralysis. you know when you're so heavy you literally can't move. you just want to drink that water. or to roll over. or to do anything!!! how can I explain that to my mum!! she just doesn't get it and it's really hard letting everyone down by being a worm :( I wish I could just explain it so they would understand and not be so hard on me you know!


any advice is welcome :))
I hope ur doing okay :')
