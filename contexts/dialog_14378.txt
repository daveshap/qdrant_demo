GEORGE: What do you mean, demons?
JACOB: He told me he was going to Hell.
ROD: What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
GEORGE: What else did he say, Jake?
JACOB: He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
GEORGE: How long had that been going on?
JACOB: A couple of weeks, I think.
GEORGE: He say what they looked like?
JACOB: No. Not really ...
GEORGE: Excuse me a minute. I'll be right back.
