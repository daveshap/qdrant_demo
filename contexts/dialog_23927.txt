EMMETT: The Parkers seem like nice folks.
HANNAH: They've been kind to me.
EMMETT: Paden sends his best.
HANNAH: I guess I put a good scare into him.
HANNAH: I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
EMMETT: I just came out to say goodbye.
HANNAH: Goodbye?
EMMETT: Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
HANNAH: You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
EMMETT: That's why I'm here.
