Study or quit
Hello, I am in a bit of a dilemma. I am in my last year of high school and failed math for the second half of the year. I got the chance to do a re-exam (Dutch so sorry for mispronunciations) and my parents got me a private teacher to help me. Yesterday I did a test of half the stuff I need to learn and only got 32%. The teacher and my parents gave me the choice to go for it or quit it and redo my whole year. I can’t decide because I am afraid that if I choose for doing the exams and it is bad I threw away my whole vacation or if I don’t that it could have been different. I know all the formulas but use them wrong. Can some of you help me decide? Thanks in advance.
