GALLAGHER: What other girl—?
STEW: The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
GALLAGHER: But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
STEW: Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
GALLAGHER: No.
STEW: There's nothing sudden about that— He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
