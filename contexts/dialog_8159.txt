EXLEY: We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl. Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
PINKER: I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
DUDLEY: This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
HUDGEONS: I'm happy to cooperate. You don't need to tie me down.
DUDLEY: It's for your own safety. Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
HUDGEONS: Trashcan Jack. The Big V. I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
HUDGEONS: Take it easy! I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
DUDLEY: But you were business associates?
HUDGEONS: What does that have to do --
HUDGEONS: Okay so we worked together. It was an information exchange. I got him first class collars and he got me good stories. We were friends for Chrissakes!
DUDLEY: Alright. We'll drop that line for now. Next topic. Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
