[Help] Meeting Store Management Regarding Bullying
Hi - I could use some advice please!

I have a meeting tomorrow morning with the Store Manager and Assistant Store Manager at the supermarket I work at in Australia, it is a large supermarket chain. I will not name them, however, I recently made a complaint to my line manager after I experienced inappropriate behaviour from the duty managers supervising the night shift that I worked (several times).

Among other things, the following happened:

* Duty manager kept us in the store after midnight when our shifts had finished, yelled at the team and team supervisor saying we had "no sense of responsibility, never have and never will" as we didn't finish putting away all of the stock (short staff, 2 new people on the shift)
* Duty manager confronted me in the bathroom on a 3-hour shift by the duty manager, 3-hour shifts have no break and I was told I was not allowed to use the bathroom during the shift
* Yelled at for purchasing a drink during my shift (again, 3 hours with no break) after I forgot to bring one, which is fine, but it took longer to lecture me about it than it did for me to buy the drink
* Told that "heads will roll" if I did the wrong thing

After experiencing this and general inappropriate behaviour and expressions from these duty managers, plus, having other staff share in my feelings, I made a complaint to the line manager and said I would consider resigning.

The store manager then contacted me and has requested a meeting tomorrow to discuss what I have said. I feel like this will be held against me at work and that I can't go back. I'm not sure what to say in the meeting either and I don't want to be intimidated as I have been so far.
