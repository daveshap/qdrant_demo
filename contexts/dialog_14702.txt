ELLEN: It's not easy. None of it is. I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try. I finally figured that out. I'm going to do my best....
MICHAEL: Good.
ELLEN: That's it? Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
MICHAEL: I'm pleased. I really am. Really....
ELLEN: No more sharks. I'll stay for another week, then....
MICHAEL: You just got here....
ELLEN: Children are never satisfied. I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael. I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back. Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
