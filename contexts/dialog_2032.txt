MELVIN: Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
FRANK: If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
MELVIN: Last word freak.
CAROL: So. Anything else?
MELVIN: Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
CAROL: Okay.
MELVIN: Hey, what I did for you is working out?
CAROL: What you did changed my life.
MELVIN: No... no thank you notes.
CAROL: Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
MELVIN: Lovely.
CAROL: I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that. I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
