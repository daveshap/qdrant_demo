MAVERICK: What would you say, too fast...too quick...
CHARLIE: And far too aggressive.
MAVERICK: It is combat. Every second counts.
MAVERICK: Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something. I'm sorry.
CHARLIE: For what?
MAVERICK: That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
CHARLIE: Apology acknowledged.
MAVERICK: Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
MAVERICK: Um. You.
CHARLIE: There you go with those moves again.
MAVERICK: Too aggressive?
CHARLIE: I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
MAVERICK: I'm special.
CHARLIE: Yes. I'll give you that!
MAVERICK: Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
CHARLIE: I can't.
MAVERICK: I thought there was something... That night in the club...
CHARLIE: Lieutenant...
MAVERICK: Evan... or Maverick.
CHARLIE: Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
MAVERICK: The what?
CHARLIE: Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
MAVERICK: What are you talking about?
CHARLIE: You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
MAVERICK: I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
MAVERICK: Harmless!
CHARLIE: Uh hum.
MAVERICK: What if he's not?
CHARLIE: You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
CHARLIE: And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
MAVERICK: Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
CHARLIE: How about what?
MAVERICK: How about anything, anything you want to do.
CHARLIE: Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
MAVERICK: A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
CHARLIE: What about the plane?
MAVERICK: What plane.
CHARLIE: Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
CHARLIE: Used to what?
MAVERICK: I'm different.
CHARLIE: I'm starting to sense that now.
MAVERICK: Let's make it at eight.
CHARLIE: Make what?
MAVERICK: Anything.
CHARLIE: Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
CHARLIE: Why'd you do that?
MAVERICK: 
MAVERICK: It dies. We live.
CHARLIE: You're an animal.
MAVERICK: That's true. What are you?
CHARLIE: I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
CHARLIE: No!
MAVERICK: It's not suffering anymore.
CHARLIE: You're horrible
MAVERICK: You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs? Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
CHARLIE: You don't have to kill it.
MAVERICK: Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
CHARLIE: You ever think about killing another human being?
MAVERICK: About as much as they think about killing me.
CHARLIE: Does it bother you?
MAVERICK: They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission. It bothers you, why? You're part of it. Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
