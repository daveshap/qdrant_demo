AMBASSADOR DE SADE: Thank you, Admiral.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Now, Mister Ambassador. In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone. I intend to tell him exactly what has happened. I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE: The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Don't be ridiculous.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE: I have your word, Mister President?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Yes, of course.
GENERAL SCHMUCK: We don't operate like you KGB boys.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Knock it off will you, General? Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
AMBASSADOR DE SADE: Where are you trying to reach him?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: At his office in the Capitol.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE: If he's not there, try... 87 - 43 - 56.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Did you get that, Kulnick?
