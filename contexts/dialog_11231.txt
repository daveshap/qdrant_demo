KIP: Otto called -
OTTO: You need him...
MEMPHIS: No we don't -
OTTO: I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
MEMPHIS: His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
OTTO: The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.
MEMPHIS: We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
