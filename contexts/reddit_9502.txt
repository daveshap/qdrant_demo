Amazon Prime for $72/year ($5.99/month) rather than the newly increased $120
I'm sure there are others on here who use Amazon Prime because they live in the middle of nowhere and the nearest stores are a hardware store, drugstore and a market not much bigger than a convenience store. 

If you have an EBT card (SNAP and other uses) or a Medicaid card, you qualify for this reduced rate Amazon Prime.
