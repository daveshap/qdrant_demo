JEFF: FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!
SOOZE: Jeff!
JEFF: So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
TIM: Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
JEFF: Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
SOOZE: Jesus, Jeff.
PONY: Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
JEFF: No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
TIM: Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
JEFF: I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
TIM: Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
JEFF: Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
SOOZE: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
PONY: No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
JEFF: No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
PONY: Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
JEFF: No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
PONY: Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
