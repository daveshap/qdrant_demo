Can we use Correlation coeffiecients in non linear case So I am having a data of several variables (one is a dependent variable and the others are independent variables).  I am not sure if the relation between each of these  independent variables and the dependent variable, whether this relation is linear or not.Is it possible (more precisely is it significant) to use Partial Correlation Coefficients (PCC) to check the correlation between each of the independent vairables and the dependent variable?  For me I am not sure that we can use PCC in non linear cases?
