Students who are older than you?
Hello everyone! I am teaching a few classes this year to supplement my stipend. I'm running in to an issue I've never had before, and I'm hoping for some ideas on how to handle it. I'm teaching a Human Development class and an upper level research seminar. I have a student, who is in both classes, who is 5-10 years older than me and has 2 kids. I have 0 kids. She contradicts me at least once a class; since we are talking about child development, and she has children and I don't, she feels like she knows more I guess? And she does make good points sometimes. I don't want to discount her experiences, but it's an academic setting; we have to deal with the research. I also just feel so disrespected/undermined when she argues with me in class, and I can see other students rolling their eyes every time she raises her hand. What would you do?
