Can quantum randomness be somehow explained by classical uncertainty? In quantum mechanics, the outcome of each measurement is random, distributed according to the squared amplitude of the wave function obtained from the Schrodinger's equation. Now, can someone suggest that QM measurement outcomes are just produced by a deterministic, real, local process (or field) in the 3-D space, varying because of uncontrollable phenomena like noise? (An example of such a  classical field can be a real 3-D coherently rotating vector field accounting for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and electron spin in a consistent manner, which carries distributed angular momentum and energy in the same way as a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave).  Setting aside Bell's theorem which forbids such an explanation and any other local realistic theory, will such a classic explanation ever be able to reproduce the probabilities obtained from QM? I have seen that deterministic QM interpretations like Bohmian mechanics introduce concepts like infinite dimensional configuration space. Why is this necessary for reproducing QM?
