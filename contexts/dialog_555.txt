WADE: I don't want her to go, Lillian.
LILLIAN: Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
WADE: I'm not making it any worse. You are. Me and Jill could've worked this thing out. It's normal, it's even normal for me to get a little touchy about it. Believe it or not. How do you think this makes me look, treating her like some tragic victim or something?
