How did you pay for your masters program/grad school? (Trying to figure out how to fund this!)
I'm entering a masters program this fall, and was planning to pay for it through a merit scholarship from my school and a contribution from my parents. Unfortunately, coronavirus seriously affected my family, and I'm now realizing that I do not want to rely on my parents for basically any contribution.

I was wondering how you paid for your masters/grad program- did you go through Grad Plus loans or private loans? I'm looking to take out $40-50k to cover the whole program cost. I'm turning 25, so I would apply without my parents' financial information.

Any advice would be really appreciated.
