Ships as survival world (post-apocalyptic world) In a post-apocalyptic world where the surviving people are forced off the land onto the water in ships, how would this work?  How long can a large set of people survive on a set of boats without support from land? Could large floating colonies be built (that would easily separate in the event of a storm or attack)? What would be the greatest danger to this colony?Edit: The boats/ships will vary in technology and crowding. Technology will be whatever can be carried off the land. There will be some haste, but some will have been prepared. Some will have even possibly known ahead of time what was about to happen. The people are mostly sane with a mix of crazies and deranged. Some will go crazy over time as resources decline. One more thought. Some people (very few) remain on the mostly unlivable land. The question is, are they better off or not?For the sake of discussion, the catastrophe that devastated the land killed most living things over a 3 to 6 month span. Small pockets of vegetation, humans and animals survived. It did not spread completely into the oceans, but did have some effect there.
