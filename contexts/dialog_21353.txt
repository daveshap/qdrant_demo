UTAH: You're a fucking dead man--
BODHI: Whoa, whoa!! Think it through! I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
UTAH: Talk.
BODHI: She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything. At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see... ... six hours from now.
UTAH: You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
BODHI: Sorry, can't do it, brah. He's on the road. And where they're going there's no phones. Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do. I hate violence. See, that's why I need Rosie. I could never make this thing work, myself. No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once. We shared time in this world. But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism. Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness. Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes. Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
