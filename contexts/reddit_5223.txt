Any tips on how to not forget to clock out? I've done it twice in two weeks!
Hi

I recently forgot to clock out before a large weekend. I work Tuesdays-Fridays and these past two weeks I have forgotten to clock out. I feel that it makes a bad impression of me to my manager and HR who have fixed it for me and assured it's fine. I have worked at this grocery store for a bit more than a month but I feel really bad about this. These shifts have been getting more stressful lately.

Thanks for any tips you have!
