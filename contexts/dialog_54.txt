PATRICK: Cameron, I'm a little busy
CAMERON: It's off. The whole thing.
PATRICK: What 're you talking about?
CAMERON: She's partial to Joey, not me
PATRICK: Cameron -- do you like the girl?
CAMERON: Sure
PATRICK: Then, go get her
KAT: This is so patronizing.
PATRICK: Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
KAT: Why 're you doing this?
PATRICK: I told you
KAT: You don't care if I die
PATRICK: Sure, I do
KAT: Why?
PATRICK: Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
KAT: Like you could find one
PATRICK: See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
KAT: Just let me sit down.
