What jobs should I try to work before applying to the FBI?
I’m just about to graduate college with a Biology degree and am planning on getting some sort of masters degree. I’m struggling to figure out what types of jobs to apply for this semester that would increase my chances of getting into the FBI in a couple of years. Anyone have any ideas?
