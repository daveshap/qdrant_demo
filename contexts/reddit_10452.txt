I'm suffering constantly I just want it to end
Edit: I'd like to thank people for all the support on this post I didn't think it would get that much attention. Lots of you are going through a similar thing and it's nice that people understand and tell me to have hope. I of course still feel terrible but knowing there are people out there who are willing to support those going through this is great. I'd also like to tell anyone with negative comments on here that you really aren't helpful and shouldn't be on this subreddit
