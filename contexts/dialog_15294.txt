DENHAM: I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.

DENHAM: Miss Darrow ... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
DENHAM: I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell
ANN: To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
