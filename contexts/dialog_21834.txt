DR. MARTINSON: Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
MOTHER: She looks terrible, just awful.
DR. MARTINSON: Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
MOTHER: She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
DR. MARTINSON: Afraid of the hospital?
MOTHER: Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
DR. MARTINSON: A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
MOTHER: Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
DR. MARTINSON: Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
DADDY: Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
MOTHER: Honey, please...
DR. MARTINSON: It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
MOTHER: It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
