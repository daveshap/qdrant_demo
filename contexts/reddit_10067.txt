Graduate School Appliction Help
Hi everyone! After a year and a half out of school in the "real world" I finally am ready to apply to grad school for higher ed. I have narrowed down my list to \~8 schools (I guess in your opinion is this too few or too many?) all of which have essentially guaranteed assistantships and funding and are in places I actually want to spend two years. The only part that I am a little at a loss for is the essays. I have somewhat forgotten how to write well after being out of school for so long and I'm not even quite sure how these essays are supposed to be written. Should a statement of purpose be: professional, tell a story, why, etc? The internet is sorely lacking in resources for this kind of thing so I was hoping for any advice or resources this community could share! Thanks!
