ARMITAGE: The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
MOLLY: How's the villa's security?
ARMITAGE: Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
CASE: What about the mainframe's access code?
RIVIERA: 3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
ARMITAGE: Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
RIVIERA: And how do you suggest I do that?
