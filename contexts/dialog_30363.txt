SCOTTIE: We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
JUDY: No! Let me go!
SCOTTIE: We're going up the tower.
JUDY: You can't. You're afraid!
SCOTTIE: I'm going to. It's my second chance.
JUDY: Scottie, please...!
SCOTTIE: But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
JUDY: Yes!
SCOTTIE: And she was the one who died. Not you. The real wife. You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
JUDY: Dead. He'd broken her neck.
SCOTTIE: Took no chances, did he? And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
JUDY: I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
SCOTTIE: Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
SCOTTIE: Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
JUDY: Yes!
SCOTTIE: And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
JUDY: Your accident...
SCOTTIE: Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
JUDY: I don't know... Switzerland?
SCOTTIE: We'll find him.
SCOTTIE: I made it.
JUDY: What are you going to do?
SCOTTIE: Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
