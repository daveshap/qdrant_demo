TYLER: There! Happy? I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise. Now look what you've done!
JACK: This isn't possible...
TYLER: We're going to have to do something about Marla...
JACK: What... what are you saying?
TYLER: It's okay. We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
JACK: No! This isn't true. We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
TYLER: You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
JACK: Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
TYLER: What about them? They're lunatics.
JACK: You took me to the house.
TYLER: The house is rented in your name.
JACK: You have jobs.
TYLER: Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
JACK: What about Marla?
TYLER: What about Marla?
JACK: She's... you... you're fucking her.
TYLER: Um, well... technically, no.
