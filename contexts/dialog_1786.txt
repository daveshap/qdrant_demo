BALA: What <u>was</u> that thing?
Z: How should <u>I know</u>?
BALA: I order you to find out where we are!
Z: Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Z: Excuse me, I -- Pardon me -- And they call them social insects.
BALA: Climb up that tree and get a better view!
BALA: I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Z: Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
BALA: How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
Z: Theoretically, yes. But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
BALA: Of course! It defines society! To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Z: But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
BALA: No! There's no such thing as just two ants." You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!"
Z: Look around, sweetheart.
BALA: I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Z: Well I guess that makes us even.
BALA: Ha! Don't make me laugh. You're crazy about me! That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Z: Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
BALA: I was <u>slumming it</u>! I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Z: Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
BALA: I <u>didn't</u> choose him. What kind of <u>idiot</u> would... ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
BALA: Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Z: Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options... You go back. Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
BALA: <u>Insectopia</u>? You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Z: Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source... that it exists. Now you follow the yellow egg... <u>That</u> direction.
BALA: Worker! Come back here now!
Z: I've got a <u>name</u>. It's <u>Z</u>.
BALA: That's not a name! That's just a letter!
