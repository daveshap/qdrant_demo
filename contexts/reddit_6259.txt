A week has passed since my drug screen. Do you think they would’ve contacted me if I failed by now?
I accepted a job offer and had my drug screen (urine test) last week on Wednesday. The last time I smoked was September 15 and I just took one hit of a vape. Before that, I haven’t smoked in 5 months or so. Everyone’s telling me I should be fine, but I’m still a little paranoid. Thanks in advance!
