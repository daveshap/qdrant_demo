What does subclassing do? So I've been playing Disgaea 5 for quite a bit and got a handle on most of the plethora of mechanics in the game but there is one that has still got me baffled as to what it does, subclasses. What I do know thanks to reading walkthroughs is that you should subclass your unique characters as soon as you get them and leave your generic characters the alone until they max their subclass out then you can switch them out. I also know that you need subclasses to unlock new characters through the recruiter and provide small stat boosts to new characters created with the upgraded class.So my question besides the minor stat boost and need for unlocking new characters what exactly does leveling subclasses do?
