Term for an image that briefly appears on computer screen What do you call an image, usually fragmented, that appears on a computer screen for a split second, such as when a webpage is loading or an app is launching? I know the term exists, but can't remember it for the life of me.An example of what I'm talking about:In this example, the scroll bar to the left appears for a split second when changing the size of the window and immediately disappears.
