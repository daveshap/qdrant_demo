Stop boasting about you declined your offers to Prestigious School X, Y, and Z
i’m tired of seeing these posts.  You are bragging. that’s all you are doing. celebrate where you choose to go, don’t list all the schools you got into for the clout. there’s no benefit you or anyone else gets from u posting that info, it’s just feeding your ego.  that’s just boastful. 

you’re lying to yourself if you justify your bragging by telling people they’ll get off the waitlist. just because you decline your offer doesn’t mean someone is getting off the waitlist. waitlist acceptances are not 1:1 to declined offers.
