Rather than post stories of savings & paying off debt, why don't people post how they got their great jobs?
You can't pay down anything, or save, without adequate income. 

BUDGETING is not going to solve a poor person's problems when their expenses are $2,000 a month but they are only earning $1,800 a month even working two low-wage jobs. 

So rather than posting stories of your post-poverty life, instead TELL US HOW, TEACH US HOW, you got the job, the income, that got you out of the pit.

THAT would be helpful.
