SOPHOMORE: Circle?
VENKMAN: Close -- but definitely wrong.
VENKMAN: Ready? What is it?
COED: Ummm -- figure eight?
VENKMAN: Incredible! Five for five. You're not cheating on me here, are you?
COED: No. They're just coming to me.
VENKMAN: Well, you're doing great. Keep it up.
VENKMAN: Nervous?
SOPHOMORE: Yes. I don't like this.
VENKMAN: Well, just 75 more to go. What's this one?
SOPHOMORE: Two wavy lines?
VENKMAN: Sorry. This isn't your day.
SOPHOMORE: Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this.
VENKMAN: You volunteered, didn't you? Aren't we paying you for this?
SOPHOMORE: Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks. What are you trying to prove?
VENKMAN: I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
SOPHOMORE: I'll tell you the effect! It pisses me off!
VENKMAN: Then my theory was correct.
