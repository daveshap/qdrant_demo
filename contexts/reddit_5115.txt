Asked for an interview only to get a rejection letter?
So the time line was basically that I missed their first email (went to spam) so I asked if I could get another time slot and they didn't get back to me until 7 days later. They apologized for it and asked me to fill available times for this week. I did that and sent follow up emails and they just never responded. And this morning I get a "we regret to inform you" email. Has this ever happened to anyone else?
