How to avoid font packages not related to language designated I am upgrading from Ubuntu GNOME 17.04 to Ubuntu 17.10. As part of the new packages to be installed, I see a list of font packages on several Asian languages that I did not asked, nor were previously installed on my computer because my system language is English (even I use Spanish for my documents).So, how can I avoid installing (in the first place) these packages, that I mercilessly will delete after the upgrading process finishes?(I am very comfortable with command-line usage, if it is the case.)
