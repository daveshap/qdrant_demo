Multilevel Poisson Regression I have some data with individual level variables (like satisfaction) and these individuals are nested within buildings (there are 12 different buildings) and I have a continuous variable that is measured at the building level. I'm trying to use this to predict an outcome that is count data. Should I be running a sort of multilevel model here? If so, what could this model say about my data differently than if I just combined all these factors into a linear model?
