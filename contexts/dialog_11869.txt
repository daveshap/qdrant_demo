LYNDA: Hi, Laurie, what's up?
LAURIE: Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
LYNDA: Is Annie around?
LAURIE: No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
LYNDA: Well, she's totally not here.
LAURIE: They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
LYNDA: Okay. Later.
LAURIE: Have a good time.
