Is going for a Doctorate Financially Worth It?
For the following year I have been accepted into a prestigious PhD program with a TA position which will cover three years of coursework. Thus far, I have not acquired any debt or have taken on any loans. I will be going straight from a BA in Music Education (as of a month ago, I'm a fully certified K-12 music teacher) to a PhD in Musicology (a field I'm very passionate about and may want to teach at the college level).    
    
Right now, I consider myself to be in a very good financial spot for someone my age. I've been saving my money since I was 16, and have a nice bank account to show for it (nothing too crazy, but much better than many of my peers). After speaking to a myriad of professors in the program, I've been told the average amount of time taken to graduate is 5-6 years, meaning that if I fall into the mean, I will take on 2.5 years worth of debt. The school is a public institution whose tuition is not too high ($11,000 per semester), but by the time I pay the tuition for multiple years, have to pay for living expenses, etc, I feel that I will be deep in the hole. I have the option to only opt for a Masters, which would be fully paid for, but I feel that would be less fruitful that a PhD, and does not expand my horizons by much. My bachelors degree allows me to teach, which means I am not necessarily set for financial ruin if graduate school does not work out, so at the very least, I have financial options and I love to teach.     
    
tl;dr: Does anyone who is currently on, or has completed a PhD have any insight regarding personal finances. Although the first several years are paid for, the thought of being debt free to potentially six figures in debt is scary.
