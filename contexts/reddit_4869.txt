Not knowing what I want my future to be is stressful and depressing
I was asked a question the other day and I didn't have an answer and it hit me like a sack of rocks. I've always felt depressed since my dad passed away in 2006 but it's hit me hard lately and I don't know why. I'm recently married, my wife just had my son, have a great paying job that's just like every other job, and a loving family, and I still feel unaccomplished, lonely, and not awake in the world. My future is a dim lit room full of doors I can't see and quite frankly, im afraid to open them. I need help...


EDIT: The question was what is your 3-5 year plan.
