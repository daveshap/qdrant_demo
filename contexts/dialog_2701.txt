PENNY PRIDDY: She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
BUCKAROO BANZAI: She was killed, Penny.
PENNY PRIDDY: Oh, my.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Don't go to pieces. I haven't got time tonight.
PENNY PRIDDY: Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Where's my damn ammo? Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
PENNY PRIDDY: How did she die? I wanna know.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: You don't wanna know.
PENNY PRIDDY: Yes, I do. Gimme a chance. I'm stronger than you think.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
PENNY PRIDDY: Hanoi Shan--? The guy in your comic books. Boss of the World Crime League? Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death? The Pivot of Mystery himself? You're putting me on. He's a cartoon character.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: I wish he was. He's real enough.
