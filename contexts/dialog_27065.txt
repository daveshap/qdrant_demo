ELAINE: This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as the early 70's." Christ
WILSON: Early 70's. I was away. Maidstone. Possibly Brixton.
ELAINE: These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
WILSON: You don't seem bothered.
ELAINE: You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
WILSON: Tell us about it.
ELAINE: It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement. Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one. SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
WILSON: Oh, I was gonna say ...
ELAINE: Still, there have been rewards. It's sunny. And some of the producers who call even have credits.
WILSON: I can see the attraction.
ELAINE: What did you do? To make them take the early 70's away from you.
WILSON: A jeweller's up the West End. We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work. Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all. Would you Adam n' Eve it.
ELAINE: You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
WILSON: We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked. Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday. Good job we were still breathing.
ELAINE: It didn't discourage you, though.
WILSON: Hey?
ELAINE: From pursuing your chosen profession.
WILSON: I'll tell ya something: it made me a model prisoner. Put me right off any escape attempts. Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience? Not bloody likely.
ELAINE: I was inside once. I punched a cop at a demo.
WILSON: Did you. What was that in aid of?
ELAINE: Who remembers.
WILSON: Get seven years, did you?
ELAINE: Overnight. What about just now?
WILSON: Just now? Overnight?
ELAINE: You <u>have</u> been away. Or is all this just new to you?
WILSON: It's true. Has to be said. I got off to a slow start.
ELAINE: I don't believe it.
WILSON: Honest. Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
ELAINE: Pushing the legal limit even then.
