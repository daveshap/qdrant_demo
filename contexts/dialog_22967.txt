PROFESSOR: This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
BRENDA: Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
PROFESSOR: No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
BRENDA: Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
PROFESSOR: No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
BRENDA: But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
PROFESSOR: He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
