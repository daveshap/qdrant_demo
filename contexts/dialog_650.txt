BOY: Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
RINGO: Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
BOY: Oh don't be so stroppy!
RINGO: Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?"
BOY: Nine.
RINGO: Bet you're only eight and a half.
BOY: Eight and two thirds.
RINGO: Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
BOY: Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
RINGO: Shurrup!
BOY: I bet you're -- sixteen!
RINGO: Fifteen and two thirds, actually.
BOY: Well --
RINGO: All right, take your hoop and bowl.
BOY: Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
RINGO: Y'what?
BOY: You heard, it gets on my wick.
RINGO: Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
BOY: I'm a deserter.
RINGO: Are you now?
BOY: Yeah, I've blown school out.
RINGO: Just you?
BOY: No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
RINGO: Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
BOY: Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
RINGO: Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
BOY: Yeah.
RINGO: Not much cop without 'em, is it?
BOY: Oh, it's all right.
RINGO: Yeah?
BOY: Yeah.
RINGO: What they like?
BOY: Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
RINGO: How about Ding Dong?
BOY: He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
BOY: Why aren't you at work?
RINGO: I'm a deserter, too.
BOY: Oh.
