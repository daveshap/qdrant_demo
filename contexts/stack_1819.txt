Off with ya meaning I am watching Django Unchained (2012) and there is a dialog between King Schultz and Speck Brothers where one of the Speck Brothers says: -I do not care, No sale. Now, off with ya. Could anyone help me find out exact meaning of the term \"off with ya\"? Can I use it in a normal polite conversation with native speaker?
