Broken stepper motor - Too high of a load? I am using a NEMA 17 (17HD4005-22B) with a Big Easy Driver and an Arduino Uno R3. I am using the motor to move a threaded rod, which then pumps a liquid. The system basically functions as a linear actuator.After trying to move a much too high load, I noticed that the stepper motor was not turning correctly. It moved erraticaly forwards and backwards a couple of steps. I also noticed to following:When I give it the signal to turn, I can turn the shaft very easily with my hand in either directionWhen it is powered and without any signal to turn, I can turn the shaft easily with my hand in either direction most of the time. If I crank the potentiometer all the way, I can not move it anymoreI connected the motor to the stepper drivers of an i3-clone printer, and  the motor does not turn. The previous two observations remainedI connected the Big Easy Driver and Arduino to one the motors of the 3D-Printer and the 3d-printer motor did not turnBoth windings of the broken motor have the same resistanceMy doubts:Is it possible that the high load caused the stepper to break?Is it possible the driver is also broken?How can I check any these possibilities?
