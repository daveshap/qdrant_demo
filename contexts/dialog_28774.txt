THX: What did you get?
LUH: I have to see SEN. I've just been given a shift change.
THX: When?
LUH: Now.
THX: Now?
LUH: He wants me to come to his quarters.
THX: A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
LUH: I don't know.
THX: Don't go.
LUH: I have to... he's a G-34
THX: You don't have to... I don't trust him. You ought to file a report.
LUH: No, don't make trouble. It's nothing.
THX: Then why did you bring it up?
LUH: I didn't. You asked me about the card. You're going to get us into trouble.
THX: I haven't done anything.
LUH: Don't be so sure.
