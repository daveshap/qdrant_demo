Need Help
Hey all! I need help deciding on a newer vehicle in 6 months. My current vehicle isn’t doing so well. It takes forever to start up and the headlights aren’t very bright. I’m looking for a vehicle that can do any of the following:

Tow a trailer
Has seat warmers for the winter
A sunroof that opens up
Can seat about 4 people 
Has Bluetooth so I can jam out to my rockin music

Which vehicle would you suggest? Jeep, Ram, Ford, or Chevy?
