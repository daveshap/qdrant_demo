My daughter (14f) tried to kill herself last night
To put it simply, I am so lost. This is the second time she has done something suicidal and I have tried my hardest to be there for her every step of the way. There are so many factors that go into this that I could type (on mobile) until my thumbs hurt. I am hurt. I don’t know how to trust her. It sucks so bad I just want to be there for her and twice now I have been informed by second parties that this has happened. I found her in the garage last night after taking a handful of pills. She was scared said she thought she was a freak. I told her I loved her no matter what. I consoled sisters and called grandmas so I could meet her and her mom at the hospital.  I told her I loved her, and now everything today is like normal. I am hurt. I am so hurt and I don’t want to put that on her. But I am tiered of emotional pep talks, and it hurt to know everything I’ve ever said to her didn’t help. I’m sorry for this thread.
I’m honestly overall just sorry.
