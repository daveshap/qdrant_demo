HARRY: Shit.
VALENTIN: Mr. D'Amour?
HARRY: Go away.
VALENTIN: It's one in the afternoon.
HARRY: What are you, my mother?
VALENTIN: I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour. About last night.
HARRY: Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay? I get a few drinks inside me --
VALENTIN: We've never met.
HARRY: Then what do you want?
VALENTIN: I'm here to offer you a job.
HARRY: I'm going back to New York in-- Shit! I'm outta here.
VALENTIN: Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
