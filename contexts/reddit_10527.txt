I love you all
You guys are practically my second family, even though we share the same pain, you guys have no idea how much you help not only me but many others that goes through these thoughts, this sub has prevented me from ending it many times, just knowing that whenever i feel sad i can come here and relate to so many people and people are whiling to help you, is really overwhelming, so thank you all for being awesome, hopefully one day we can find peace, even if it seams cloudy and rainy outside.
