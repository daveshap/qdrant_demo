PSA: If you're unemployed, try and stick to a work-out routine. Your future employed self will thank you.
This is a good time to get fit. You have extra time on your hands. Exercise gives you a sense of accomplishment and uplifts your mood. If possible, club it with job applications to make it a habit. For example, send out 3 applications right after 30 minutes of exercise. Pick up something easy (running, biking, bodyweight exercises), start small. The returns in the long run are huge, both mentally and physically. 

I say this as someone who recently got back on the employment train and now finds it difficult to do anything fitness related consistently.
