New job is going great but a person on my team let me in on some “inside info” on my boss.
This guy seems like he’s a genuine and very good person, however he told me he’s likely to be fired over the next few months. He told me on a phone call:

1. My boss is super passive aggressive and doesn’t get along with other managers.

- I haven’t really seen this in the 5 weeks I’ve been here. She’s been helpful, seems to get along with others. However, I have noticed a couple passive aggressive remarks. Again, nothing when looked at on a whole.

2. Isn’t a good manager of people.

- I looked into this and mr predecessor was only in my position 3 weeks before she fired him. The girl before him lasted a year before she left(don’t know if she was fired). My coworker said she hasn’t managed him well and threw him to the wolves. 

-From my experience she’s been helpful, complimentary, supportive and there for me. Went out of her way to get me started remotely, a great relocation package and on payroll with everything going on.

I found out this coworker received a warning letter for his inappropriate and unacceptable behavior but don’t have details. He does seem like a good person though... what would you do with all this info?
