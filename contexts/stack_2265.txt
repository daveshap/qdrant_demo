What determines who is shown in the ending kill cam? In COD WWII, every game ending kill game seems to be random.  In previous COD titles, it was the last kill of the game.  Now, I can't tell what is used to determine who is shown in the ending kill cam.  The kill cam always displays \"Bronze Star Awarded for Heroic Service.\"What determines who is shown in the ending kill cam?  I know it's not whoever has the highest score and it's not always the last kill of the game.
