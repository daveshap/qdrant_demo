Finally got rid of the "-" in my networth!
After a year of working for a toxic company, not only did I not put any dent on my student loan, I dug deeper into a -40k networth. Thankfully said company ran out of money and I got to leave the toxic environment behind. Also some lucky 0/1% fee balance transfer offers and 0% APR promotions definitely saved my life couple of times, so don't give up hope!  A year later I finally got rid of that negative sign on the very last day of the year! Here's to a brand new decade! Stay strong!
