JACKIE: Ever been tempted?
NICOLET: What? To put one of these in my pocket?
JACKIE: Uh-huh.
NICOLET: If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
JACKIE: Yes. All those things are true.
NICOLET: After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
JACKIE: That would be one point of view.
NICOLET: Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
JACKIE: How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
NICOLET: I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you. Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
JACKIE: Si.
MAX: I'm going out for a few hours.
WINSTON: Hold on a minute. Where you going?
MAX: I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
WINSTON: Watcha gonna see?
MAX: Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
WINSTON: Have fun.
