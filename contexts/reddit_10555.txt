I think people who die are lucky
they don’t have to suffer every fucking day, they don’t have to be reminded of how worthless they are. they are at peace.

I wish I could be at peace. I’m completely worthless. I deserve to die. I really do. I have notjing to offer all I do is suffer and make others suffer and I wish I was dead I can’t take it anymore

please make it stop
