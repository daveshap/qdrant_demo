TAYLOR: Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why? I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
LANDON: Climb off me, will you!
TAYLOR: And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
LANDON: Taylor.	I'm telling you --
TAYLOR: Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever. Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
LANDON: Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
TAYLOR: Don't bother
LANDON: Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
TAYLOR: But I'm not prepared to die.
LANDON: I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
