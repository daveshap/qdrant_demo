SAM: I can't, Sandy. I've got to run.
SANDRA: I'll bet. Look, Sam. Why don't you come by this weekend. We'll take the boat out...
SAM: Sorry, Sandy. I've got plans.
SANDRA: What? Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
SAM: Swamp's where it's at, Sandy. Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of. You ought to try it some time.
