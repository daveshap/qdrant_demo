Is anyone else noticing that all of the dating apps are getting worse and worse?
It seems that every app these days are just putting more and more features behind paywalls or outright removing them rather than adding more features. On top of this, I've noticed that some of them have started putting ads in with premium memberships making them way less desirable than they used to be.
