Is there a way to add English subtitles for S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat? I am Russian myself, and I have, obviously, played S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series in Russian language (the original one). However, I want to share this game with some of my friends who don't speak Russian at all, and I have found out that this game is awfully translated. It is dubbed in English, not subtitled. IMO, this English dub is of very bad quality, I like the original much more. At the same time, some lines are not dubbed (and hence not translated at all!), so an English-speaking player wouldn't understand what goes on.I did a quick Google search, it did not yield anything. I liked that Source games where you could easily turn subtitles on, reading stuff in any language you want, but listening to it as it was originally done.Any option to do the same with S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, particularly \"Call of Pripyat\so I can reliably advise the game for my non-Russian friends?
