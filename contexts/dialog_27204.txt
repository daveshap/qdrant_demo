TRUMAN: How are you, Mother?
MOTHER: Well, I made it through another night.
TRUMAN: How's your hip?
MOTHER: Oh, just so.
MOTHER: You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
TRUMAN: I've got something to tell you. You'd better sit down.
MOTHER: You look very pale, Truman. Are you taking your vitamin D's?
TRUMAN: I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
MOTHER: I feel certain my condition runs in the family. Can't this wait, dear?
