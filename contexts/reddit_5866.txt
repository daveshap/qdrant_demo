What jobs can I get if I study marketing?? Art related??

Hi everybody. Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about my future. I’m 18F and I’ve just finished my first year at college studying business. 

The thing is, I really like art and design, and I want to do something related to it. However, I didn’t have enough confidence to enter an art or design program out of fear that I wouldn’t be able to get my foot in the door and kickstart a career out of it. The art industry is very competitive, and I felt like I couldn’t market myself or understand the business side without studying business. 

I don’t mind business; I find some parts, such as stocks, accounting, some management concepts interesting. But I don’t want to just do business my whole life.. I kind of don’t even know what it is exactly, since the field is so broad! I’m specializing in marketing since I heard that you can do advertising or maybe even design. I just want to do something with a mix of art and business. However, I don’t know what jobs are actually available that mesh those two together

I guess my general questions are: 
1. What kind of jobs are popular in the marketing industry?

2. Is it easy to find jobs that mix art and business? What are some tips for in school and when you graduate that will help??

3. If not, should I switch programs? I was thinking it was also possible to land an art related business job by working w a company long enough so that you could shift roles within the company.

Thanks.
