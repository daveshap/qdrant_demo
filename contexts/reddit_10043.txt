Permaculture garden, any students have one already?
I am working on getting a permaculture garden going on my campus.  I would like to start something where we can grow amazing vegetables and fruits that can shared by all. I would like to get students involved and working together, I the president of a club at a commuter school so its very hard to get people interested in anything.  So I want to try and start this project that students can help on the way to their car even.  any thoughts, help, ideas, comments to assist me??
