KELVIN: What's wrong with you? We need your help.
SNOW: I won't be making the trip.
SARTORIUS: Snow, get up here, now.
SNOW: I'm not Snow.
SNOW: I got rid of him. I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
SARTORIUS: Fuck me. I knew it.
KELVIN: When did this happen?
SNOW: Oh, right away. That's why you never saw me with anyone. You should've noticed that. I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
KELVIN: Jesus...
SNOW: But I can't leave with you. I won't make it.
KELVIN: Maybe you can.
SARTORIUS: You want it coming back with us?
SNOW: You go ahead. Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now. Everything's a blur. I like distinctions.
