Do recruiters 'own' you for a particular employer?
I am an engineer with 5+ years experience in a particular field. There are 4 or 5 large employers in the area. (50mi radius)

If I interview for a position through an recruiting firm at company A and don't get the position, can I apply directly to company A for a different role? Is there a timeline to consider? Are there any laws to protect me? ( United States - Massachusetts)

Thank you!
