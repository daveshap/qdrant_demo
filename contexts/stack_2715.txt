Other theories where other stuff influences the Mexican Hat Higgs Potential beside Temperature Since we don't know what is the origin and physical interpretation of the Higgs potential or the Mexican Hat. Is it subject to interpretation like we do in the quantum wave function? Is the temperature bouncing the higgs at the middle also just for sake of illustration.. meaning there is possibility the Higgs potential are controlled not even by temperature but another field hidden for example remnants of the inflaton field or dark energy that triggers the phase transition to produce non-zero vev and consequent electroweak symmetry breaking? Any papers in arxiv for this stuff?
