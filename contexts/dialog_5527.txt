FERGUS: Go to sleep now.
JODY: I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
FERGUS: What?
JODY: A story.
FERGUS: Like the one about the frog?
JODY: And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.

JODY: What does that mean?
FERGUS: Nothing.
JODY: Tell me something, anything.
JODY: Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
FERGUS: Me? No, I'm not good for much...
