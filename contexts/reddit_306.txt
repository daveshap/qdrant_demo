How can I get my mom to stop degrading me as a person?
My mom has always said how shitty of a person I am my whole life. The many times Iâ€™ve confronted her on it she tries to flip it on me and make me seem like the bad guy accusing her of such thing. She had recent found out about my sister having sex even though she is 21, calling her a whore. When I confronted her about that as well she said she said no such thing. My mom has been manipulating my siblings and I for our whole lives. What is a possible way to get her to stop now that we are all past our teenage years?
