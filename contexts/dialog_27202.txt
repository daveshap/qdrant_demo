MERYL: Where have you been?
TRUMAN: I've been thinking--
MERYL: Oh, God.
TRUMAN: --I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
MERYL: Every time you and Marlon--
TRUMAN: --We could bum around the world for a year on that.
MERYL: And then what, Truman? We'd be back to where we were five years ago. You're talking like a teenager.
TRUMAN: Maybe I feel like a teenager.
MERYL: We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments. Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
TRUMAN: It'd be an adventure.
MERYL: I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?
TRUMAN: That can wait. I want to get away. See some of the world. Explore.
