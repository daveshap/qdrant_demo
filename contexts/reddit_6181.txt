How and when do you usually receive your schedule (retail)?
About two weeks ago, I was hired at Burlington. I was told that I would receive my schedule during onboarding/orientation. Well, orientation was a couple of days ago, and I did not get a schedule. Instead, we were told to come to a different location on the 12th and 13th for what I think is going to be training, and they are sending people to different locations all over the city. 

Is this normal? When and how should I expect to receive my schedule? Should I ask my manger when I go for training, or would that come off as pushy? I’m getting a little nervous because I need to figure out transportation times and costs since I rely on the bus, and I also want to make sure there’s no miscommunication so I don’t miss work before I even officially started.
