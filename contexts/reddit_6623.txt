I had a nightmare interview with a recruiter years ago, and just scheduled an interview with the same personâ€¦ Anything I can do?
**UPDATE:** KILLED IT!

"We have some history" was what they said, so they definitely remembered me. They didn't use the "expert" line, but they had some pointers for my resume, which I will actually take into consideration because they were really constructive.

They also said I have an "excellent resume", and while the market looks really rough for work these days, I think they will actually do their best to place me. Really glad with how this turned out.

Thanks to everyone for your advice. I was nervous as hell, but I did some prep, had a few answers in my back pocket, and it was definitely one of my better interviews in recent memory.

\------------------------------------------------

So I met with a recruiter 6 years ago when I was having a lot of trouble looking for work. I was nervous as hell but I tried my best to prep, came in with copies of my resume and work samples, bought presentation material, etc.

Basically, the recruiter said that unless I'm "an expert" at a particular skill, it shouldn't be on my resume, and that I must be lying on my resume. It was literally the worst interview experience of my life.

Turns out I have a zoom interview for a job next week with this same person. I just lost my job and this opportunity would be a good one, but I have less than zero interest in talking to this person again.

I'm all for constructive criticism, I'd love some on my resume in fact, but what this person did was just demeaning.

I get nervous on interviews as it is, and I'm legitimately not sure how I'm going to do this. Is there a professional way to handle this? Should I just suck it up and do it? Xanex (seriously)?

***Edit:*** *Whoa, this blew up way more than I thought it would.*

*It's pretty clear I have probably have a good amount of emotion invested in this experience that this person may not even remember. I need to do some prep work for sure, but how it goes from there I think will be determined by their professionalism.*

*It's a job I would like, but wouldn't make my career or anything, so it's not worth taking abuse for, but it's been a while since I've been on an interview, so best to at least get this under my belt and do the best I can with it.*

*Thanks everyone for all the advice. I'll try and provide an update next week.*
