I got fired and I am lost / happy (?)
I got fire today because I was being negative at work , i told new comer not to come to work which I never did. But I kinda see that coming when I tell my colleges I will quit soon knowing there is sneaky mic and I have been saying it for a year.

I got abuse, called worthless, bad, dumbass, go kill yourself, everything you can imagine. I never fight back, I just take it and smile. When I told them I have a final so can I get a break, first thing she said is you should quit your school, you won’t succeed. 

Everyone at work know I got abuse, everyone was happy about me finally stand up for my self.
I finally say fk it, and bye, I am leaving today. At the end, they still have to give me the “is your problem, not me” attitude when literally everyone ask me to quit ASAP because what horrible bosses they are.

I am worry they will messed up my resume and jobs that I worked for almost 2 years. I give them the letter today and done with it. Should I still write it on my resume. It is a small company and not sure what will they do. 

I am doing lots of courses (CPA related, should be in CPA pep around August) right now so i actually have things to focus. But they end around July. Should I go get a job, should I finish it? Can someone share your though?
