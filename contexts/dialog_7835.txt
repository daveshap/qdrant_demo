PAUL: I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
THUFIR: Those sounds could be imitated.
PAUL: I'd know the difference.
THUFIR: Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
PAUL: My father sent you to test me. Music then?
GURNEY: No music. I'm packing this for the crossing. Shield practice.
PAUL: Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
GURNEY: Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
PAUL: I'm sorry Gurney.
GURNEY: Not sorry enough.
