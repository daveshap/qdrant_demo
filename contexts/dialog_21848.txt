MOTHER: I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
DR. MARTINSON: Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
MOTHER: I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
DR. MARTINSON: Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
MOTHER: Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
WASKI: Mother... is Rose going to die?
MOTHER: No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
DOLL: Why is it taking so long?
BUDDY: Here comes Daddy.
