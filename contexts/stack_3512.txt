Secure Admin Password in Open Source Software I am writing a server using nodejs. It is on a public GitHub repository, so its complete code is visible to anyone. The client can send strings to the server. I need to determine if the given string is the admin password. How can I check if the string matches the admin password, without revealing the password in the source?Note: I must use open-source, so it can't just be a private repository.
