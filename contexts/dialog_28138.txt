EMILY: ...I’m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that’s who I am. Do you get what I’m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
LOMBARD: What about your friendly cop?
EMILY: My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks I’m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son. But he’s a good guy. He’ll listen to you. He won’t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
