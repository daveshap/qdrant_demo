How I bought my house with no money down. www.naca.com
Folks,  

Someone should do a sticky on this program. It is absolutely the best program I have heard of for buying a house when you do not have money for a down payment.  I bought my first house this way.   

Here goes:

HTTP://WWW.NACA.COM is a quasi-government corporation that was set up when Bank of America got busted for doing predatory loans.

- No money down.

- No closing costs.

- Lower than average interest rate.

- They will pay your mortgage for up to 2 years if you become cash strapped, and wrap it onto the back end of your mortgage (there is a small monthly fee for this).

- They will give you extra money to buy a multi-family property since that type of property will provide you extra income (this is what I do - my rental income pays my mortgage).

- It's the best way out of poverty that I know of.

- There is a limit on how much they will lend you

- You are asked to help support the program by advocacy (what I'm doing now)

- I'm no longer in the program. 

It works like this:

1) Go to the website and sign up for a seminar if they have the program in your area.

2) At the seminar they will assign you a counselor.

3) *** You'll meet with your counselor and give them access to all your financial info, they will track your income and expenses for 3 months to a year!!!  This will determine how much money they can safely lend you.

4) Buy your house. I suggest a multi-family, it will provide you with extra income.  Over time, not only will your housing be providing you with income instead of being an expense, it will also grow in value and become your nest egg for your future.

This is 100% legit, mods, please check it out.
