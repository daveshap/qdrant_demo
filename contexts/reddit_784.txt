Backstbbers
I am born with a sickness where my bone marrow doesnt make red blood cell witch means i can not drink or do anything a 13-17 year old person can do (experimenting / i call poisoning) so my freinds drank and decided to do it again but the group got bigger until it is the full class now my problem is that since i cant join them with "experimenting" with drugs and alcohol they decided that i should slowly be pushed out of the class there plan worked i have no freinds just a full class of enemies that keep on tormenting me and now i have thoughts of suicide (i came close twice 1st the gun and decided NO 2nd time i held the bullets)

What should i do?
