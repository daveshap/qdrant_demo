A happy post: I'm in my second relationship, and I couldn't be happier!
So, I've been in a rather unstable relationship half a year ago, my ex was very uncommunicative, depressed and ended things after half a year of dating.

I met my current girlfriend on Tinder. We quickly realized there was a connection between us. After one month of dating, we decided to make things official and now we're in a committed relationship.

And she is the sweetest girlfriend I could think of! She's cute, witty and clever. We have a similar taste in music, similar interests, life goals and ideas of the ideal relationship. Also we are sexually very compatible.

She wrote me a poem, and tomorrow I'm surprising her with a letter :)

I was pretty close to stop looking for dates online,  and try my luck in real life. But for once in my life I'm so happy I procrastinated!

To all the singles: Enjoy your single time. It prepares you for your next relationship. And to people in relationships: I wish you the best for your future, and may your relationship be a good one!
