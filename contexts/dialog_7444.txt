SCRATCH: Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
JABEZ: Look here now--
SCRATCH: Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
JABEZ: I don't care.
SCRATCH: But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
JABEZ: Leave your tongue off of that!
SCRATCH: Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste. But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.
