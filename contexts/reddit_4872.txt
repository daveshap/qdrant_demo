Don’t want to be annoying, but I miss my best friend
About 2 months ago, my best friend stopped talking to me. There was a situation at work where I was more abrupt than I should have been and I know I hurt his feelings. I apologized the very next day. At the same time, we both went through major life crises. I did my best to support him but it felt like my entire life was falling apart again, and I spiralled back into depression again. 

I know he will never apologize for the things he said to me or how he hurt me. I also know that he has never been one to initiate a conversation. But I miss him so much that I’ve been physically sick now for two weeks. Along with the whole pandemic situation, I have never felt more alone. He’s made it very clear that he needs space to deal, but I need to talk. 

It’s getting bad. I can’t sleep. I keep throwing up. If he’s going to hate me for one mistake I made, I know I should just move on. But I can’t. What do I do?
