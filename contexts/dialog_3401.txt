LOTTE: I'm getting divorced.
LESTER: No you mustn't, my child.
LOTTE: But why, Son of Malkovich?
LESTER: We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him... ...for lack of a better word.
LOTTE: What are you doing?
CRAIG: I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
LOTTE: Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
CRAIG: You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
LOTTE: I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
CRAIG: What?
LOTTE: I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
CRAIG: No they're not.
LOTTE: You've always hated the animals.
CRAIG: You've always loved the animals.
LOTTE: I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
CRAIG: What's that?
LOTTE: Us, of course.
