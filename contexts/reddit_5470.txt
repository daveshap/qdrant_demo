How to properly negotiate job duties
I'm originally from the U.S., the company that I work for sent me to work for them in another country for 2 years.

Up to this point everything was great. I was learning more and more everyday.

Recently management here has added more responsibilities, some of which are out of my sphere of influence or area of expertise.

How do I properly tell these folks hey this is too much or hey I need a lot more training on this before I can be held accountable for the results? How can I do this without sounding like a lazy bum?

This is a very fast paced job with a lot of responsibilities and tasks. My 12 hour days go by super fast because of all the things we have to do. There comes a point however, where there is just too much on my plate, I'm already coming in early and leaving late. I did 14.5 hours the other day and we only get paid for 12.

I'm locked in this position for two years. I cannot quit without having to repay the money they spent paying my rent, utilities and moving me out here.

Like I mentioned earlier, up to this point I was doing well, keeping up with the fast pace of the job and learning fast but these past few days have been demoralizing and I'm stuck in this hole because if I leave I have to pay back what they have already spent on me. 

Help appreciated.

Thanks
