LETTY: Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
RUTH: You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
LETTY: But what am I going to do?
RUTH: Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
LETTY: I can't. I can't see him there.
LETTY: I was so sure. I really thought it would work. We have plans, Ruth.
RUTH: I know. I know.
PAUL: I'm glad you agreed to see me.
LETTY: I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
PAUL: Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
LETTY: Oh.
PAUL: How's work going? Are you back at school?
LETTY: I start on Monday.
LETTY: Getting back.
PAUL: I heard about your friend.
LETTY: What?
PAUL: I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
LETTY: Michael. Yes.
LETTY: Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over. And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
PAUL: I think I've heard this speech before.
LETTY: I'm really sorry.
PAUL: I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
LETTY: Sure, I understand.
