Help! My parents are always on my crazy little brother’s side
Here is a little background: I am 14 and have straight a’s. I have a little brother who is only 5 and has temper problems. He gets mad on the slightest things I do. For example, today, I was eating my breakfast and my little brother was watching a video on a laptop. He then said “Wow this is my favorite episode” in Armenian. I looked over to see a glimpse of what his favorite episode was and then he started screaming and closed the laptop really hard. He quickly ran to my mom who saw everything and started telling her about how I peered at his laptop. My dad quickly came and picked him up and said “WHY DO YOU ALWAYS MAKE YOUR BROTHER CRY?!” My baby brother was still yelling and crying in frustration and my mom was also very disappointed at me and said to my dad to take me to my Granparents house. I started telling them that I did not do anything bad and that my brother was screaming for no reason. They did not listen to me and my dad said “ok, if you are going to be like this for the whole summer, we will take you to summer school!” And then I said “if you do that, I will fail every class.” Then he got mad and I went to my bedroom in frustration. See, this happens every day and I am done with it. Please give me advice on how to solve this problem and why my parents are always on my brothers side.
