HAMMOND: Wait a minute, Cates. I've been waitin' three years for that. I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
CATES: There's nothin' to talk about.
CATES: It's your money. It'll be here in six months when you get out.
HAMMOND: And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
CATES: That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
HAMMOND: You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
CATES: No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
HAMMOND: Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
CATES: Thanks.
HAMMOND: No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook? Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
