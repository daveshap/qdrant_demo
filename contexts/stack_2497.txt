QGIS showing decimal degree coordinates in map/layout composer display I am using QGIS (2.18 or 3.0) to create nautical charts drawing upon NOAA raster tiles and other info (e.g., lines showing magnetic north). I now want to save PDF files for different subareas using map composer. The subareas are quite varied but at times overlap slightly -- not a set of touching rectangles that could be done using the altas option.  To do this systematically, when completing a map composition I need to record the decimal degree coordinate for each corner of each map.  I was hoping that the \"coordinate capture\" plugin worked in the map composer, but I don't see that as being an option (e.g., icon).  If the coordinates in map composer showed as long/lat units, that would be sufficient, but clumsy.  However, MM are the units on the composer window even when the corresponding QGIS window shows long/lat coordinates.Can you suggest methods to capture the long/lat coordinates of the corners of maps in composer?  Even better, any suggestions on how to easily transfer the coordinate data to a spreadsheet?
