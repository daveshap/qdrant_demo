Bernie Sanders overwhelmingly won the youth vote in the democratic primary. Is this more likely due to a generational ideological shift or to younger voters being more embracing of change?
[Sanders won under 30 voters by a huge margin.] (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/bernie-sanders-democratic-party-us-election-2016-dominance-among-young-voters-chart-a6938911.html)

A logical explanation could be that younger Americans sympathise more with his social-democratic leanings. But older Americans, who can still remember the Cold War, may see his policies as too socialist. If this is true, then in 10 or 20 years a candidate with similar ideologies to Sanders may have an even better chance in a presidential race.

...OR in a few decades will the current youth voters become less willing to elect such a candidate? Will they oppose change more as they age? In the 1968 democratic primary, much of the younger population supported [Eugene McCarthy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_McCarthy) Those voters are now the same older voters who vote overwhelmingly in support of Clinton.

I'd like to hear your best arguments!
