How to delete partially downloaded updates in High Sierra? I'm trying to update my Macbook Pro to the latest security update for High Sierra but the download doesn't seem to finish and is working in a really weird way. I tried to cancel the current update, and it does cancel, but when I try to start it again, it doesn't start from the very beginning and shows an entirely different progress than what it showed before I cancelled it. For instance, I cancelled the download at around 700mb, but when I tried up update again, it shows that only 300mb has been downloaded.I want to start the download from the start, from 0%, which I think will fix the issue but I can't seem to do that, too. Can anybody please help me? I tried to wait it out already, but it just gave me a connection error around 1.6GB. When I tried to start again, it started at around 738mb.
