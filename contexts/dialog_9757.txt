FLETCH: Maybe tonight?
CREASY: Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
FLETCH: That's what he said.
CREASY: He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
FLETCH: I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
CREASY: Sonofabitch.
FLETCH: Wonder who his supplier is.
CREASY: I have no idea.
FLETCH: I wasn't asking.
CREASY: He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
FLETCH: I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
CREASY: I ought to get some sleep.
FLETCH: Creasy, how old are you?
CREASY: Nineteen.
FLETCH: You're not taking real good care of yourself.
MAN: Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
FLETCH: What?
STANWYK: We can't talk about it here.
FLETCH: Why not?
STANWYK: Because we can't.
FLETCH: Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
STANWYK: I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
FLETCH: I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
STANWYK: I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
FLETCH: Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
STANWYK: It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you. One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
FLETCH: Nugent. Ted Nugent.
STANWYK: Alan Stanwyk.
FLETCH: Charmed.
