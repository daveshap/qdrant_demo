NICK: You tell me.
CATHERINE: I don't know. But you do.
NICK: It was an accident. They got in the line of fire.
CATHERINE: Four shootings in five years. All accidents.
NICK: They were drug buys. I was a vice cop.
NICK: Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
CATHERINE: There's a name from the past.
NICK: You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
CATHERINE: Noah was my counselor in my freshman year. That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick. For my book. Funny how the subconscious works. Hazel is my friend.
NICK: She wiped out her whole family.
CATHERINE: Yes. She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
NICK: Didn't you study it in school?
CATHERINE: Only in theory. You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter? Not in theory -- in practice.
CATHERINE: What happened, Nick? Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
NICK: No.
