BROOKS: You're in 201 and 202.
KARLA: Is that bad?
BROOKS: Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
JULIE: Your what?
BROOKS: Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
JULIE: We haven't exchanged anything.
KARLA: Julie, we're talkin' suites! That'll be just fine with us.
BROOKS: And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
KARLA: Wait...Did you say off-season?
BROOKS: July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
JULIE: Storm season?
BROOKS: It's our version of winter. 201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
KARLA: Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true. I wanted you all to have a good trip.
TYRELL: We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
WILL: And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
JULIE: It beets being on the mainland.
KARLA: Oooh, the mainland --
TYRELL: Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
