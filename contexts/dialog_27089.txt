ED: ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
CREIGHTON: Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
ED: I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
CREIGHTON: Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
CREIGHTON: ...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
ED: No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
CREIGHTON: You got the dough?!
ED: I can get it, yeah.
CREIGHTON: Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
ED: No. I--tell me--
CREIGHTON: Sure.
ED: What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
CREIGHTON: Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
ED: And how do we share--
CREIGHTON: Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
ED: I'll have it in a week.
CREIGHTON: Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
CREIGHTON: ...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
ED: Ed.
ED: ...Was that a pass?
CREIGHTON: Maybe.
ED: You're out of line, mister.
CREIGHTON: No problem!
ED: Way out of line.
CREIGHTON: Right! Strictly business.
ED: Yeah.
