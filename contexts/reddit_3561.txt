Sometimes Being Alone Is Better
I mean, seriously.  Having time to yourself to find out what's best for you and what's best for the person you want to be with in the future can be extremely therapeutic, even if only in hindsight.  My last (and only) girlfriend cheated on me before dumping me, and looking back on it I'm better off for it.  I got my mental state under control.  Took steps towards bettering my life and job.  I'm getting a new tattoo and looking at cars soon.  I also feel much more stable and like a better fit for someone BECAUSE of the time to improve myself.  You'll find one eventually, until then focus on yourself and bettering your situation.
