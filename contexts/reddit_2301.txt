College admissions is a lot like dating
I see a lot of people on here get really surprised when a seemingly perfect candidate gets rejected. Even with a 1600 SAT, 36 ACT, 4.0, started a non-profit, internships, research publications, summer programs, the blessing of the Pope himself... they get the same thicc rejecc that 90% of applicants to competitive colleges will recieve.

"How could *they* be rejected?"

**"If** ***they*** **can't get in, then who can??"**

I realized though, this whole admissions thing is a lot like romantic relationships. Even if someone is perfect on paper, if there's no chemistry or they're not the right person for you, the relationship isn't gonna work out.

Even if someone is the 'perfect applicant', they still may not be the right student for a certain college. It goes the other way too: just because a school is prestigious doesn't mean it's where you're gonna be the happiest.
