Thinking about starting a drone business when I separate from the military, what do you all think?
I was thinking about doing this after I separate in about 2 years, maybe sooner than that. I currently have an Inspire 1 but am considering on getting the Inspire 2 and mainly use it for 3D imaging/property scans via controller software and some film stuff if I would get approached by someone. 

In the area I live in there’s plenty of opportunity with real estate and wind turbines and whatnot and starting out I’d probably be approaching companies to get my name out there but I’d have no idea what I would ask for pay. I already have my part 107 as well. 

Thanks y’all
