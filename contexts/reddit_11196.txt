Just to Tell Someone
I was drugged and sexually assaulted by a female friend of mine. 

I was hanging out with her one day and she told me that she liked me and that she wanted to be with me. I told her I didn't want to be with her and tried to let her down and lightly as I possibly could. Then she got hysterical and told me she was going to cut herself and commit suicide and stuff like that.

She has a history of mental illness and self harm so I panicked and tried to calm her down and she just broke down in front of me crying. I held her and after a while she calmed down and asked if I wanted some soda. I accepted and we talked for a little bit.

At some point I blacked out. I don't remember anything from sitting on her couch to being naked on her bed. My groin was wet and  had scratched along the length of my chest. And she was sleeping right next to me, also naked, spooning me with her arm across my chest. 

I quietly got out of her bed and left. My clothes were dumped outside her room so I put them on and went home. From there I've only told a few people, but not the whole truth except for two.
