MILES: Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
PATRICIA: We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
RUTH: Is this a lover?
MARYLIN: Please!
MILES: And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
PATRICIA: Mother?
