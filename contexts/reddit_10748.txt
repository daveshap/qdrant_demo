I'm tired of trying
On mobile so sorry about formatting

Like the title says. I'm sick of getting up everyday at the crack of dawn to go to a job that pays too little and get my ass chewed for 9 hours straight everyday. Nothing makes me happy anymore. Getting out of bed in the morning feels like climbing a mountain alone. Anything I try to do for entertainment is only a momentary release from this shithole we live in. I feel defeated. I use to have ambitions, goals, dreams. But now I can't even imagine a world where I can be happy. I don't want to continue on, working the same crappy job to go home to the same crappy parents that I can't move out from since I can't make enough money. I have no friends outside of work. Things look monochrome constantly. I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this.
