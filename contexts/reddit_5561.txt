A Question Regarding Education Level On An Application
Greetings. I'm 17, HS senior, and am looking for a new job (currently employed). I have an Associate's degree of liberal arts from the local community college (Was able to do college classes in 9+10 grade + PSEO). I don't have a HS diploma yet though. If I were to state on my application that I have an AA, would this be an issue?
