Design an SMPS to provide 5V \u2013 Transformer I'm trying to design an integrated IoT device that will replace standard light switches. Currently I'm using a Switching Power Supply from eBay: HLK-PM01, just to have an working prototype. Now I spend over a week searching for example schematics, IC and others to create my own small switching psu, but really I'm quite unsure how to begin with.I need to provide around 300 mA 5V from 240V AC in my whole circuit. I've got an ATmega168PA, nRF24L01+ and other less important components, like status diodes and one analog sensor to power. I'm building the psu on my own to have the possibility to arrange those components on the PCB a bit more and to gain more knowledge about those modules.Found out that an IC from the TNY263-268 family, from Power Integrations should fit my needs, but now my problem is: <blockquote>  What type (something like EF12.6 or EE13..?) and from where could I purchase a complete transformer that will fit into my circuit?</blockquote>Often most examples mention discrete component values, but those transformers aren't really described.Maybe I'm horrible wrong with all this, but I'm open to all suggestions and advices I can possible get.
