Using ModelBuilder/ArcPy in ArcGIS Pro to Iterate Field Values of Multiple Feature Classes? I am using ArcGIS Pro 2.01 for this task.I have 114 shapefiles (each represents a session of the US Congress) which include every congressional district since 1790.  I have added a short integer field to each feature class called \"Congress\".  This field is intended to signify which session of Congress that feature was used for.  For example, all 435 features in the shapefile representing the 114th Congress should have a value of 114 for that field.I am trying to automate the entire process using ModelBuilder.  I do understand that this could be done in Python but I would prefer to use the ModelBuilder so that I can teach my high school GIS class how to do this before showing them the code.Each shapefile contains the Congressional session number at the end of the filename.Should I try to use the For tool or should I use something like the Iterate Field Value tool?
