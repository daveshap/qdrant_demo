HELLER: ...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue. The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
MULDOON: Elvis?
HELLER: Joey Cicerno. Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov. Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
MULDOON: Jesus. Two in one night?
HELLER: Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
MULDOON: Pick me up in five minutes.
VINCENT: Limos, huh?
MAX: Don't start.
VINCENT: Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
MAX: She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
VINCENT: Maybe so. Maybe she hears what you tell her.
MAX: Fuck! Nothing's ever goddamn good enough! It's always been that way.
VINCENT: It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you... I had a father like that.
MAX: Yeah? What happened?
VINCENT: He hated everything I did. Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
MAX: What happened?
VINCENT: I killed him. When I was 15. He was my first. Nah, wishful thinking. Liver cancer.
MAX: I'm sorry.
VINCENT: Don't be. I never saw him after I was 15. Went into the military early. So all this talk about my job's temporary
MAX: It's not bullshit.
VINCENT: What do <u>you</u> call it? Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me. I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
MAX: I've always been good. Ever since I started. Gave up piano. Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started. Go figure it all out...
VINCENT: Yeah? Like what? Limos?
MAX: I told you I don't like to talk about it.
VINCENT: Well, this big stake's got to be big by now. When you leaving?
MAX: See, I've got bills. My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
VINCENT: What, no insurance?
MAX: Doesn't cover everything.
VINCENT: Good excuse. How many others you got?
