Complications related to grad school in a new state. I’m a student, fiancé isn’t. Can we both retain residency in old state? Does he have to legally move to new state? What did you guys do?
Moving to Indiana for a master’s (Purdue) from Pennsylvania.  My fiancé is also moving with me, but will not be a student, and we’re trying to work out the complications and implications regarding legal residents. Pennsylvania has lower tax rates than Indiana and they have reciprocity agreements (so we wouldn’t be double taxed). 

Does he have to become a legal resident of Indiana because he isn’t a student?

If he does, would it just be simpler for both of us to be residents of Indiana and pay the slightly higher taxes? 

Related, do car insurance companies allow graduate students to insure cars in one state and register the car in a different state? 

Any and all help/advice is greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!
