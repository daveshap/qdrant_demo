LOOSELEAF: I've been looking at motorcycles.
HAROLD: Go home!
LOOSELEAF: You ever own a motorcycle?
HAROLD: You're right! We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take. I don't want to talk about motorcycles. I don't want to talk about tits. Go home!
LOOSELEAF: Haven't got one.
PENELOPE: And you went home unannounced, too?
LOOSELEAF: I dunno. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I did.
HAROLD: And how were things?
LOOSELEAF: Let's talk about something else.
PENELOPE: Alice got married again.
LOOSELEAF: She did?
PENELOPE: You didn't even find that out?
LOOSELEAF: There was so much going on.
PENELOPE: She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
LOOSELEAF: So that's it! Kestenbaum
HAROLD: Otherwise, how are things?
LOOSELEAF: I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
PENELOPE: Dead!
LOOSELEAF: Jesus.
PENELOPE: Alice is dead?
LOOSELEAF: No, no--shit no. Excuse me, Penelope.
PENELOPE: For what?
LOOSELEAF: For saying shit." Or is that okay now?"
PENELOPE: Who's dead?
LOOSELEAF: My mother-in-law. Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
PENELOPE: What happened?
LOOSELEAF: Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive. Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered. She had her Goddamn knitting. I said, Guess who?" She conked right out."
PENELOPE: How horrible.
LOOSELEAF: Yeah--cripes. I never did get any sense out of Alice. She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel. It was a bitch. You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy. Maybe not. I dunno, boy. That's civilian life for you. Who knows what kills anybody?
HAROLD: Could have happened to anybody.
LOOSELEAF: First Nagasaki--now this.
HAROLD: How about breakfast, wife?
PENELOPE: Breakfast?
HAROLD: Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple. Do you understand?
HAROLD: And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
PENELOPE: Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
HAROLD: All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler. Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
PENELOPE: That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
HAROLD: Which one?
PENELOPE: Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.""
HAROLD: She's up in Heaven now. She didn't hear. She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness. There's nothing nicer than that. Chow! Harold Ryan wants chow!
PENELOPE: What a honeymoon.
HAROLD: Honeymoon temporarily canceled. The boy should still go out and exercise. I have the impression he never gets any exercise. He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
PENELOPE: You're wrong.
HAROLD: Then let me see him go out and get some exercise. Right now!
PAUL: What kind of exercise?
HAROLD: Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
HAROLD: Chow, chow, chow! God damn it-- nutriment!
PENELOPE: We're all going to have to go out for breakfast. The cook quit yesterday.
HAROLD: You're a woman, aren't you?
