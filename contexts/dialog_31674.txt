XANDER: Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
GIBBONS: I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
XANDER: They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?"
GIBBONS: Yes it does.
XANDER: Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
GIBBONS: Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
XANDER: Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
GIBBONS: Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
XANDER: Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
GIBBONS: Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
XANDER: We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
