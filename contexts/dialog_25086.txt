GERMAN LIEUTENANT: Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
GENEVA MAN: Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
GERMAN LIEUTENANT: As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
GENEVA MAN: They also smell of moth balls. When were they issued? This morning?
GENEVA MAN: What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
GERMAN LIEUTENANT: The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
GENEVA MAN: How long is temporarily? I trust not until July.
