My doctor forgot to call in my meds
They’re closed for the weekend and I’m in really bad shape 3 days off meds. Is there an emergency-type of meds I can take to make the zaps lessen? I’m on Pristique so being off it so suddenly is also causing havoc on my gastrointestinal system as well.

Edit: thank you all for the advice. I called my doctor and she said, as some of you suggested, to call the pharmacy and ask for an emergency supply. I asked her what to do if they refused and she said call us in the morning. Which I was planning on doing originally anyway. By the time I called the pharmacy, however, it was already closed. I can’t drive myself to urgent care as some of you have also suggested because the shakes are pretty bad. Whatever could go wrong has gone wrong. I just have to ride it out. And I’m changing doctors tomorrow.

Edit 2: Just wanted to say thank you to all of you again. I called my doctor 3 times - once yesterday, twice this morning and then the pharmacy and still nothing has been done. So I begged the pharmacy and they’re giving me a 3 day emergency supply which I am getting a neighbor to pick up for me (bless her). The zaps are really bad and work is always crazy on Mondays and I feel like I’m about to lose my job because I can’t focus to save my life. Anyway my point was I never would have known about any of these options (asking for emergency supplies) if it hadn’t been for you all and I just wanted to say THANK YOU and to all of you who reached out to me. Sorry I’m totally rambling!!!!
