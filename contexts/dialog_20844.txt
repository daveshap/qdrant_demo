WILL: How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
GIBBS: Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work. That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
WILL: Really? So ... what's the story on the pistol?
GIBBS: I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts. This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
WILL: What? He never told me that.
GIBBS: Ah -- he's learned, then. Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England. Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share. So, they're forty days out, and the First Mate says, everything's an equal share, that should mean the location of the island, too. So Jack gave up the bearings. That night, there was a mutiny.
GIBBS: Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew. He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
WILL: How did he get off the island?
