LULA: How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
SAILOR: Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
LULA: I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
SAILOR: Come look at this.
LULA: What's that, honey?
SAILOR: There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
LULA: It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
SAILOR: Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
