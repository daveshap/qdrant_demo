MUMFORD: Is that when you split up?
SOFIE: No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
SOFIE: So whose route is this?
MUMFORD: Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
SOFIE: And he's where?
MUMFORD: In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
SOFIE: I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
MUMFORD: You like it?
SOFIE: It's all right.
MUMFORD: Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
SOFIE: And this is legitimate therapy?
MUMFORD: Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
