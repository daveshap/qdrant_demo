Attempted suicide a few hours ago and I'm shook and so scared.
I've been at my all time rock-bottom for the past few days and I've been crying every night. It all accumulate this morning when I tried handing myself after my parents left for work. 

It's left me absolutely shook. Even writing this I'm shaking and my breathing is unnatural. I'm so scared, I'm really fucking scared. This is my first attempt so I've never felt anything like this before, the tears, the shaking, all of it. I can't stop crying, I can't believe this is real. Who knows if I'm gonna even be here next week, the way things are going I'm unsure, and this frightens the hell out of me.

I've had a therapist for the last 6 or so months and it really helped, but as soon as I stopped I instantly when back into my depressive state. I don't want to be stuck talking to a therapist my entire life. So I haven't been back and I don't plan too. 

If you've read this far, thank you so much for hearing me out, I just had to say this, I feel sick after what's happened.

Much love to everyone out there. Together, we'll get through this, all of us.


EDIT: Thanks to everyone who took the time to read this and especially to those kind hearted and uplifting comments. I am pretty worried about everything that's been going on with myself but reading the comments has helped to calm me down immensely. Honestly I can't thank you enough.
