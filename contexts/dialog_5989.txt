HOMER: *Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!

CANDY: Stop it! Just cut it out!
HOMER: You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
CANDY: For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!

HOMER: He's *alive*. He still loves you. So do I.
CANDY: What do you want me to *do*?
