How do I tell my boss Im leaving?
Work isn’t a great place right now for many negative reasons and I’ve managed to thankfully find myself another job I’m excited about.

People from my team have been quitting a lot recently and they haven’t done a great job at replacing them - me leaving will be a big deal.

I will have to give a month notice period - I fear they will take it personally as im leaving them in a bad place but I have been looking for a while.

I guess I’m just looking for the right words to say when I tell them.
