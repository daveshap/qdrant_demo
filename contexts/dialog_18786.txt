SAUNDRA: So where does this lead ?
BRUCE: No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
SAUNDRA: So what do we do ?
BRUCE: I'm working on it.
SAUNDRA: Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
BRUCE: It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
SAUNDRA: First Bank ? But how ?
BRUCE: It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
SAUNDRA: McCay knows ?
BRUCE: Knows ? He watches every Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we."
