KAREN: What'd you fight, middleweight?
KENNETH: Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed. You go about what, bantam?
KAREN: Flyweight.
KENNETH: You know your divisions. You like the fights? Like the rough stuff? Yeah, I bet you do. Like to get down and tussle a little bit? Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle. I say to her, You a good dog
KAREN: You're not my type.
KENNETH: Don't matter. I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
KAREN: Just a minute.
