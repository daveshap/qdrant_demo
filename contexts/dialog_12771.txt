BRUCE: Too hot?
HILDY: No. It's strong. But I like it that way.
BRUCE: Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
HILDY: He certainly -- hic -- does!
BRUCE: Anything the matter?
BURNS: Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
HILDY: What now?
BURNS: His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him. I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
HILDY: You said it.
BURNS: So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
BRUCE: Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
BURNS: It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
HILDY: If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
BURNS: Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
HILDY: The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
BURNS: Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
BRUCE: Are you sure Williams is not all there?
BURNS: All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
BRUCE: But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
BURNS: How?
