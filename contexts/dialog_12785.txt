EGELHOFFER: The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
HARTMAN: You said it!
EGELHOFFER: They're always after me for interviews.
HARTMAN: Me, too.
EGELHOFFER: Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
HARTMAN: Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
EGELHOFFER: We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
HARTMAN: A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
EGELHOFFER: Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
HARTMAN: It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
EGELHOFFER: Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
WILLIAMS: Are you gentlemen all through with me?
EGELHOFFER: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
EGELHOFFER: You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
WILLIAMS: The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
EGELHOFFER: I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
WILLIAMS: In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
