RONNIE: Scottie?
ROPER: Hmm?
RONNIE: I've been thinking.
ROPER: Hmm?
RONNIE: Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
ROPER: Yeah.
RONNIE: You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
RONNIE: I was just thinking... There's something special I want to talk to you about. I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship. A deeper level.
ROPER: A deeper level?
RONNIE: That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
ROPER: Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
RONNIE: Scott...
ROPER: I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
RONNIE: ...the hell are you talking about?
ROPER: I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
RONNIE: I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
ROPER: You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?' Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the M" word."
RONNIE: You thought I was talking about getting married?!
