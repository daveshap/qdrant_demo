I'm Ken White, First Amendment litigator and free speech writer at Popehat.com: Ask Me Anything
Greetings, /r/NeutralPolitics.  I’m a criminal defense attorney and a First Amendment litigator.  I write about First Amendment and criminal justice issues at www.popehat.com and in places like the Los Angeles Times and the Daily Journal.  

My project as a writer is to make complex legal issues clear, entertaining, and compelling to non-lawyers without dumbing them down, and to encourage literacy about our civil liberties.  I’ve tried that, for instance, in my [lawsplainer series] (https://www.popehat.com/tag/lawsplainer/).  Sometimes I work to find pro bono counsel for people targeted with bogus defamation suits.  I’m preparing to launch a podcast about the First Amendment.  

Ask me anything!   


Edited to add:  I answered as many as I could during the time provided -- sorry I didn't make it to everyone.  Thanks very much for participating.  I may come back over time and answer some lingering questions.
