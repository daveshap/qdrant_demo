INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
RANDAL: No, I wasn't.
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: I don't think your manager would appreciate...
RANDAL: I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: I beg your pardon!
RANDAL: Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
RANDAL: I hope it feels good.
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: You hope what feels good?
RANDAL: I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
RANDAL: You'll be missed.
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER: Screw you!
