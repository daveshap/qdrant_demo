DEAN: You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
NIXON: Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
DEAN: I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this. Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
NIXON: John, you don't want to start down that road. I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, On the road of the informer
DEAN: I understand that, sir.
NIXON: Good. You know how I feel about loyalty. I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail. That I promise you. The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John. I have complete confidence in you.
