Unetbootin .Deb with all dependencies needed Ok, so I did a fresh install of Ubuntu 17.04 Zesty. Me, being stupid like I sometimes am, didn't make a Windows 7 bootable USB. Windows was the only way I could get online(tether through pdanet). So I need someone to use an online Linux machine to apt-get the Deb package and dependencies for me so I can dual boot windows. It would be greatly appreciated being the other fastest way would be if I downloaded every single file one-by-one. Thanks!EDIT: question isn't about creating the USB itself. It's about getting the program and all dependencies in one go.EDIT 2: This isn't about making the usb its about helping me get the files on an offline machine with the only other device I have has android on it. I literally just need the deb files in an archive. I already know how to use the tools.
