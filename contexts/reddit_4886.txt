I feel extreamly unmotivated to go on with life
I see no point to this. I don't want to continue. I don't think I'm depressed or anything, but if I was given the option to never have existed I would take it. I never asked for life and I don't think I want it. The only thing keeping me going I suppose is the trauma I would inflict if people found my body in my apartment. Besides that my parents spent a lot of money on my education and without me to provide for them when I finish they may end up in poverty. I'm trying to do better but some things just seem to be taking me 10 steps back the moment I try harder. I think I'm growing number to life. I have a final tomorfow and I don't care.
