New hire at a small importer, and I am having 2 roles dropped on me almost immediately
I was recently hired at a small import company that is based above their brick-and-mortar store. I wanted this job, and they wanted me, so the hiring process was all good and I am happy.

However, on my first day I found out 2 core coworkers out of the 5 here in the office are LEAVING. (They are both coincidentally moving back to their home countries, not a job related departure...)

The boss is mostly an accountant, and the other person is a part-timer, mostly accounting. The 2 leaving were doing all the orders and buying, communicating with the warehouse and overseas vendors, etc.

I've had an interest in this world for a while, and I'm finally in it, but my training is going to be mercilessly short and hasty. I have a strong office admin background, I am just starting to get nervous that when these 2 key members leave I will be swamped.

What can I do to make this transition easier on myself? What are the key things I should ask for now? I want to someday soon be a buyer for this company, and with my immediate mentors leaving soon (by end of March), I am worried about letting people down.

Note: They do say the warehouse office staff will be available to help me, but they are based 9 hours south of us, so phone and email are the only ways they'd be able to help.
