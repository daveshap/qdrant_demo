SPOCK: I assume command of this ship as of 0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
UHURA: Yes, sir.
LT. SAAVIK: But we can't allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
SPOCK: What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
SCOTTY: At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
SPOCK: I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
LT. SAAVIK: How did you - ?
SPOCK: In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
SCOTTY: NO WAY!
SPOCK: Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
