GANZ: Surprise, Luther.
LUTHER: Whaddya want? I thought you were locked up-
GANZ: I want the money, asshole, what do you think? The money that Reggie hid...
LUTHER: I don't know what you're talkin' about.
GANZ: You want that Indian to snap her neck?
GANZ: Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
LUTHER: Don't give me this, we were partners.
GANZ: Billy, go ahead, break it...
LUTHER: No! Don't kill her. I can get you the money.
GANZ: When?
LUTHER: I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
GANZ: You chickenshit punk...
LUTHER: Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
