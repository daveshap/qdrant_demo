HAWKEYE: Well, there it is. Jesus!
DUKE: The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
DUKE: What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
HAWKEYE: Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
HENRY: I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
HAWKEYE: Nope, we're assigned heah.
DUKE: Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
HENRY: Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
DUKE: Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
HENRY: You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
DUKE: They give you copies to burn.
HENRY: Good. You've both been working close to the front.
DUKE: Never this close.
HENRY: They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
HAWKEYE: Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
DUKE: That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
HENRY: I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
DUKE: Just one for a start.
HAWKEYE: The blonde dish.
HENRY: If you mean... She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
HAWKEYE: Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
HENRY: They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
