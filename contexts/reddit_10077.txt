Need help for student activities
So the government is required to finance our student association ( faculty of physics) for our events. They will give money for food, transportation and for prizes. I only have an Earth Hour idea. Does anyone know what other activities can I come up with?? They have to be scientific, cultural-artistic, technic(i have no idea what it means) or sports nationwide
