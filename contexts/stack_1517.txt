How long can a brand new PCB last before additional protective coating is required if any? I have just made several PCBs for a large project using the photoresist method. (I ran the boards through sodium silicate developer then through ferric choride) I then rinsed off all chemicals and dried the boards.I believe there is some chemical electronic stores sell (conformal coating? I don't know) that would protect the circuit board from any sort of corrosion (which can include introduction of open circuits).I know the next steps are to drill holes and solder components in, but after that process is complete, how long can I leave the board like that before it is absolutely necessary to add some sort of protective coating to it?I want my board to last forever but at the same time, I don't want it to corrode (or have traces break up) as the years go by.
