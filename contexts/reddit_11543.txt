I suck at everything
I seem to have no talent at all and haven't accomplished anything.  The sports I play are the best example I put as much effort or more than anyone else and in return I get mediocre results.  I'm really competitive but whatever I put my time into I am just not good at.  This is crushing my sense of self worth and I just feel like nothing matters since im shit at everything.
