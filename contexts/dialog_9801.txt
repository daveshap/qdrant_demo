FAT SAM: Jesus.
FLETCH: You don't know me.
FAT SAM: My pleasure.
FLETCH: I'm serious, Sam.
FAT SAM: What, the heat here?
FLETCH: Affirmative.
FAT SAM: The two surfer boys?
FLETCH: Affirmative.
FAT SAM: Thought so. What for?
FLETCH: For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
FAT SAM: You gonna nail the chief?
FLETCH: I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
FAT SAM: Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
FLETCH: You don't have a piece of the action?
FAT SAM: Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
FLETCH: Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
FAT SAM: Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
FLETCH: What?
FAT SAM: You find the source?
FLETCH: Gum thought Brazil.
FAT SAM: Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
