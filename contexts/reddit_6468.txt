How to handle conversations about former toxic workplace?
I left an extremely toxic workplace after 3 years. It was poorly managed, the employees (only 5 in the entire company) were not qualified for their jobs, high turnover rate (I had 4 managers in 2.5 years), constant gossip and drama to undermine and bully employees, I  never got a raise despite doubling my workload and got paid less than what was listed on government documents (didn't realize this till after I quit), etc. 

I found a much better job in the same city and the field is small enough that my former workplace still comes up in conversation with colleagues. Despite my strong feelings about my former company, I have always remained neutral and stay silent whenever it comes up.

My problem is some colleagues want to get involved there and I know they could be more successful elsewhere due to the toxic environment, poor management and lack of correct field knowledge (some colleagues hear stories of my former workplace from other sources and are in shock of how horribly run it is). 

TLDR: Left a horribly toxic workplace, the company still comes up in conversation with colleagues and some are interested in getting involved there. Nothing has changed at that company (if anything it has gotten more out of control) since I quit. Is there a way to politely warn my colleagues or steer them away from my former workplace so they don't waste their time?
