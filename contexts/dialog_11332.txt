WILL: That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
PSYCHOLOGIST: Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
WILL: I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
PSYCHOLOGIST: --you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book."
WILL: Yeah, I read your book. Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker."
PSYCHOLOGIST: Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
WILL: You're right. I know.
PSYCHOLOGIST: Will, your not getting off that easy.
WILL: No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
PSYCHOLOGIST: Like what, Will?
WILL: I go places, I interact.
PSYCHOLOGIST: What places?
WILL: Certain, clubs. Like, Paradise. It's not bad.
PSYCHOLOGIST: I might understand that.
WILL: Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
PSYCHOLOGIST: What?
WILL: C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
PSYCHOLOGIST: That's very presumptuous.
WILL: Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
PSYCHOLOGIST: Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
WILL: I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
PSYCHOLOGIST: You're getting defensive, Will.
WILL: Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
PSYCHOLOGIST: Who is Danny Terrio?""
WILL: If you wanna hit Ramrod
PSYCHOLOGIST: Well, I can see this is pointless...
WILL: You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
