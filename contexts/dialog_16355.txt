CLIFF: So you knew this young man before?
ATHENA: From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
PRISCILLA: Did you know he was going to be there last night?
ATHENA: If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
PRISCILLA: And you and Private Graves--
ATHENA: We were just dancing--
PRISCILLA: We're not running a dating service here.
ATHENA: I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
CLIFF: It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
ATHENA: I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
ATHENA: Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
CLIFF: He'll live.
PRISCILLA: He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
CLIFF: He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
ATHENA: Out of the Army?
CLIFF: He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
ATHENA: Will this go on my record?
CLIFF: If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
ATHENA: Thank you, Sergeant Major.
CLIFF: You're dismissed.
ATHENA: Thank you, Sergeant Major.
PRISCILLA: You spoil 'em, Cliff.
CLIFF: Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
PRISCILLA: But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
CLIFF: She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
