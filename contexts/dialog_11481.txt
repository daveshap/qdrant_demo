GRUSINSKAYA: Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
BARON: I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
GRUSINSKAYA: Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
BARON: I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
GRUSINSKAYA: Really?
BARON: Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
GRUSINSKAYA: No?
BARON: When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
GRUSINSKAYA: And?
BARON: And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
GRUSINSKAYA: And what do you do -- now?
BARON: I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
GRUSINSKAYA: Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
BARON: I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
GRUSINSKAYA: That's a silly joke.
BARON: Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.
GRUSINSKAYA: What is the matter?
