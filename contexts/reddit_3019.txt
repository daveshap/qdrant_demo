Take a job that sounds stressful and “just a job” to escape horrible boss?
I have decided to leave my job of 5 years due to bad management and no growth, and received an offer for a higher paying job in a new industry. Here’s the thing -  the new job doesn’t excite me and might be more stressful. I have to get out from where I am, but worried I’ll hate the new job since it’s not an industry I’m passionate about. 

Do I take this offer just to escape now or try to wait it out for a job I’d be excited doing?
