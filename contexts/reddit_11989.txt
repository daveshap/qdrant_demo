I am very insecure/depressed about my body and I hate myself because of it
I hate that I'm below average in everything. I have smaller hands, smaller feet and I am shorter than the average man.. I even have smaller hands than women. And this insecurity I have makes me want to kill myself. I just hate being insecure all the time. Especially when I'm out in public. I just automatically compare myself to others... Sometimes I have to go hide somewhere and start crying and it makes me feel so pathetic and stupid. I even cry myself to sleep sometimes because of it. I've had this insecurity for like 10 years. I've always hated the way I look. And today I just feel I feel that I can't take it anymore. I've had suicide thoughts for two weeks now and I know that I'm going to do it. Just have to find the courage...
