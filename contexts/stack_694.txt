Intercept shutdown call and run script to allow or prevent shutdown At this moment my laptop is starting to have what I think hardware issues.Sometimes I have to try 3 times before it starts successfully.I am trying to save the code I modify in my usb stick but sometimes I forget.That is why I am wondering if there is a way to run a script when the user wants to shutdown the computer. This script will check several things and depending on the situation it would either cancel the shutdown and ask the user to perform some action (insert a usb key for example), or execute some statements (save to usb if it is there) and allow the shutdown after.Because of this necessary interaction with the user just putting the script under /etc/rc0.d won't be enough.Thanks
