KANE: Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
CARTER: How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
KANE: You've got a private office here, haven't you?
CARTER: My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
KANE: I'm going to live right here. As long as I have to.
CARTER: But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
KANE: That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter. The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
KANE: I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean. There's a front page story in the Chronicle
CARTER: Because we're running a newspaper, Mr. Kane, not a scandal sheet.
KANE: I'm still hungry, Brad. Let's go to Rector's and get something decent. The Chronicle" has a two-column headline
CARTER: There is no news big enough.
KANE: If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough. The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
CARTER: As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon. Our man even arrived before the Chronicle" reporter. And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead."
KANE: The Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered
CARTER: It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives. If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
KANE: That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter. Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the Enquirer" will have him arrested. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge
CARTER: Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
