WYATT: Mattie. What about this?
MATTIE: I need it.
WYATT: 'Least you admit it.
MATTIE: Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
WYATT: Look, Mattie, I know you're-
MATTIE: You know nothing. What you don't Know would fill a book. Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most. You're never Yourself, you never relax. Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself. Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh. But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt. I get so cold. What's between you and that Jew woman?
WYATT: All right, look. I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie. I can, I swear.
MATTIE: Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you? Right out loud so I can hear? Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt? Will you do that?
