BOBBY: What happened to speak when spoken to?
KENNY: Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.
THE PRESIDENT: We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
KENNY: Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
BOBBY: We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
THE PRESIDENT: McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
