ROZ: I sent for the police. We can explain.
SPIDER-MAN: Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
ROZ: Right. Let's go.
ROZ: You're sure you're all right.
SPIDER-MAN: Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey. Lucky you showed up when you did.
ROZ: Logic. Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270-- I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
SPIDER-MAN: Imagine how I feel.

SPIDER-MAN: The usual. Heredity and environment. What's the deal with Doc Ock?
ROZ: He'll try to finish his experiment.
SPIDER-MAN: And blow up the universe just to prove he's right? Bit egotistical, isn't it?
ROZ: A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
SPIDER-MAN: Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.

ROZ: I see. Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away. Sad. He might very well have the truth.
SPIDER-MAN: Phooey on that.
