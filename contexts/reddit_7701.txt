Job Interview!
I’m nervously excited for an interview I have on Wednesday with my campus’s Counseling and Psychological Services for a Community Mental Health Coordinator position. 

This will be my first non-student level position and can last my whole grad program. 

Any general tips or advice about interviews? I was also told to prepare some questions and don’t want to be generic to find out more info of this role/staff/workplace. What do y’all ask? 

Thanks in advance!
