MCCALL: What's the point of this?
ROPER: A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
BAFFERT: Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
ROPER: Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar."
BAFFERT: I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
ROPER: Yeah, okay.
BAFFERT: This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
ROPER: You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
BAFFERT: Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
ROPER: It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
BAFFERT: No shit! He's good!
ROPER: Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
BAFFERT: Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
