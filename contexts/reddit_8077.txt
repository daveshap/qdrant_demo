Expected salary post graduation
Hey there, does anyone have any good resources for what the market value of someone who is coming out of school?

For example, I have my business admin BS, biomedical engineering BS, and MS of mechanical engineering and have no idea what is fair to ask for (going into industry). Any advice or resources are appreciated. I would kill for some kind of estimate/calculation.
