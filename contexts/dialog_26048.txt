FAITH: Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news. An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
TRAN: A tragic story, no doubt. How'd you get up here?
LENNY: Charm.
TRAN: Uh huh. Look, Nero. I'll make you an offer. Take her. Right now. If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go. I'll let her choose. Faith always knows what she wants. Hands off. See?
LENNY: It's alright. He means it.
TRAN: I do mean it. And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again. You understand?
FAITH: I made my choice, Lenny.
TRAN: You're going down.
