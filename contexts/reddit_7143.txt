Startup Salary growth.
I’m considering leaving my f500 company for what I consider to be a startup (less than 100 employees). Let’s say my current salary is 50k and the startup offers me 50k. 50k is below market value at this job title and for my degree, but it is still considered entry level for this role. 

So my question is, would I experience faster salary growth at the startup or the f500? Assuming I stay there before leaving whichever company for a higher paying job after 2-3 years.


The startup position is a role which I would get a lot more professional and personal growth out of. I think I would enjoy it more. It is difficult for me to accept another job which I know is less than what I should be paid at.
