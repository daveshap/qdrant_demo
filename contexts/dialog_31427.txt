JAMES LEER: You all right, Professor Tripp?
CRABTREE: He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
JAMES LEER: Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
CRABTREE: Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
JAMES LEER: Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
