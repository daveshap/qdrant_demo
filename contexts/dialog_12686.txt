RACHEL: Do not underestimate the power of your heart. Your dreams live there.
MCCLEOD: My dreams died long ago.
RACHEL: Did they? You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man. You feel the same -- want the same. You want to live.
MCCLEOD: I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it. I've existed in the shadows.
RACHEL: And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
MCCLEOD: Dear, sweet, Rachel. Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
RACHEL: If you search your heart you know all the good you have done. Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just. This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made. And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
