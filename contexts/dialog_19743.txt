PAT: Do you really want this, Dick?
NIXON: This. Above all.
PAT: And then you'll be happy?
NIXON: Yes ... you know it! Yes ... I will. Yeah!
PAT: Then I'll be there for you.
NIXON: You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
PAT: Can I just ask for one thing?
NIXON: Anything.
PAT: Will you ... would you kiss me?
