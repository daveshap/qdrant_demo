I was just fired from my new job, I'm reeling and don't know what my options are.
**Short version:** 

I left my previous job to start with a new company in a totally new industry.  I was learning a lot but for complicated reasons my boss became either impatient or outright sick of me and just fired me on the spot this afternoon.  I absolutely did not see it coming, I was never given any serious warning or given any indication I was on thin ice.  I've never been fired, laid off, asked to resign, or pushed out in any way.  I'm embarrassed and angry and feeling helpless.

I've only worked for this place for about 2 months, so I don't qualify for NYS unemployment, in both earning and time employed.  I have bills to pay and I don't have a backup plan.  I really have no idea what to do.  I can get my ass on craigslist ASAP but for the moment I'm kind of shaken up about it and can't even begin to think about what to look for.  A few hours ago I was making plans, now I am thinking about how to keep my car and cell phone.

**Long crybaby version**

I was making decent money driving a truck around NYC.  I clocked around 68 hours a week and the grind of it really wore me down.  A friend who works for a performance shop knew this job was killing me and referred me to an opening at an affiliated business.  I only had basic car knowledge, I can change oil and put in new brakes, but not much beyond that.  However, they were willing to train and my resume was like pornography for this particular position.

I'm pretty well spoken and got the job without even an interview, just after meeting the manager and talking while I filled out the application.  After the first week the boss was still rosy on me, I was learning the cars really quickly and getting along great with the other guys.

Being new to the industry made me a perfect candidate as scapegoat for when things went wrong.  I made a few mistakes in the early going.  My boss is a flawed guy and had a lot on his plate, and made his fair share as well.  Some were 50/50, but instead of arguing with him about who was at fault I usually just tried to solve the problem and move ahead.  I just figured this was new-guy treatment and he would trust me more as I continued to get better.

And I did get better.  The boss scheduled a long awaited day off in May and I was gearing up to fly solo for a day.  I made myself valuable by going through his backlogged merchandise and freeing up money tied up in obsolete or slow-moving inventory.  I was assertive, positive, well liked.  He told me '...when I put you on commission...", "...when I can get you ordering our inventory..." like he had plans to keep me.  I made my own plans accordingly.

Over the last few weeks I was starting to feel like he was beginning to resent me or trust me less than before.  A couple more mistakes happened and he would always jump to conclusions and blame me.  I'd quietly and respectfully point out my innocence in the case but he would typically just be pissed off and not want to talk about the details.  He is the type of guy that will get in 'a mood' and you can never be right, just stay out of his way.

Today, I was driving the company car (it's wrapped and our company name is written on giant letters on the side) when some guy starts tailgating me.  I ignore him.  He pulls up along side and starts gesturing at me.  Don't care.  We get to a red light and he rolls down the window and really starts letting me have it.  I'm driving too slow, I cut him off, I really have no idea what he's talking about.  I don't engage him, I just say 'Relax dude.  Take it easy.  Relax" He calls me a faggot and peels out.  When I eventually get back, bossman takes me outside and just says 'You're done.'  There was no argument.  

I tried protesting but he literally walked away from me.  Said there is no discussion.  I haven't even explained to him my side of the story, because his mind is made up already and the road-rager calling him is his perfect excuse to pull the plug on me.  Anything I said to him following that was met with "I don't care dude, I'm done, you're done, that's it."  

I wanted to read him the fucking riot act and explain, in great specificity, how all these mistakes he's holding against me were his doing.  But this is a guy who won't even hear what I have to say, so I just got my stuff together, said goodbye to the guys and left.

I plan on going in person and speaking with the owner on monday.  Not to beg for my job (I'd love to keep working for him but now the relationship with his manager is completely broken), but to just tell my side of the story.  For all I know this maniac told my boss I was cursing at him, swerving, who the hell knows.  I don't want to throw my boss under the bus and tell him how incompetent he is or how he made me a straw man, I'm just so incredibly frustrated that I could be cut loose without even getting to defend myself.

So what the hell do I do now?  I am making WAY less than I did at the driving job, but I was okay with it because we spoke so much about more money and responsibility.  That low wage and short employment window means I don't qualify for unemployment in NYS.  I have bills to pay and my savings are depleted as I was tapping it to cover myself until my raise at three months, which was coming right up.

I feel totally humiliated and taken advantage of.  I have no idea what I'm going to do.

I apologize for run-on sentences and inappropriately-placed-hyphens, I've never been fired or even been in serious trouble at any job I've worked.  It's a bizarre feeling and my mind keeps going to being a bitch, curl up in bed and cry like a baby, or jump off the roof and not worry about anything.  I'm not actually considering suicide but I fucking feel that way right now.
