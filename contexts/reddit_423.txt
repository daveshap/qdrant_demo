I think my dad walked in on me master baiting
The other day I was lying in bed, jerking off when suddenly my dad opened the door without knocking. I threw the blanket over myself and asked what’s up, I forget what he said but it is not important to the story. I’m not sure if he actually saw anything or not but I’m really hoping he didn’t. Please dint give me any of this “Talk to him” BS Because me anxiety would never let me even think about actually doing that. Not sure exactly what kind of advice I’m looking for, just something to calm me a little, I guess.
