VICKI: Is that a school?
WALTER: K through sixth.
VICKI: Doesn't it get noisy?
WALTER: I like the noise.
VICKI: My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
WALTER: You must hate it.
VICKI: I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
WALTER: What about bears?
VICKI: What about them?
WALTER: They could eat you.
VICKI: Yeah, they could.
VICKI: I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
WALTER: What?
VICKI: You're damaged.
VICKI: Something happened to you.
WALTER: Yeah?
VICKI: I'm not easily shocked.
WALTER: I get that impression.
VICKI: So... what's your dark secret?
WALTER: Why do you want to know?
VICKI: Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
