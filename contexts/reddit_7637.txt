Apply to all opportunities immediately? Or pursue best leads first?
Currently, I am in talks with my 1st and 2nd choice companies. They have not made an offer yet, but they are known to take up to a couple of months.

1. Should I continue to apply to other companies in the meantime? What if I receive an offer from somewhere else and my #1/#2 have not responded yet?
2. Does turning down an offer close that door for me in the future?

Thanks for reading!
