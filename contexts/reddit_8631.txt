What are the economic pros and cons of Universal Basic Income?
I took a look through [this page](https://www.procon.org/headline.php?headlineID=005363) regarding the pros and cons, but these are rather short, and it only provides a couple of arguments either way. 

One of the things about this specifically is a concern I had myself without even looking anything up, regarding the cost of UBI. I am aware that Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang [intends to use a value added tax](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/value-added-tax/), at least in part, to offset the cost of Universal Basic Income that he's suggesting [as his primary platform for the Presidency.](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/) 

Can anyone provide any more context that I might be missing, studies that may have been done? I couldn't find anything on a scale larger than a few people, where Yang is proposing $1,000 a month for every citizen over 18. If this has some unforseen consequences I haven't yet read about, or even if there's a benefit I'm unaware of, as well as perhaps the actual legitimacy of using VAT to cover the cost of UBI? 

Edit: Holy crap, this got a ton of popularity over the last day or so. Thank you ALL so much for this information. you've given me a ton to think about, and I hope the question helps anyone else who was trying to figure out their own personal feelings and stance, risk/reward value to them, etc.
