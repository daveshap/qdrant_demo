I failed a class
I used to be a straight A student, to the point where getting a B would horrify me. In ninth grade, I had a really crummy math teacher, which resulted in my math grade to sink down to a C. The fact that since high school started, I made a LOT more friends than I had in middle school, which only increased in 10th grade, causing me to mess around in class with them.
The only reason I got the C was putting in a lot of extra effort, which took its toll on my other grades, netting me two Bs as well.
I shook it off, because everyone was saying that the math teacher I'd have in tenth grade was amazing. Unfortunately, he quit before 10th grade started. The new teacher seemed okay at first, but it became apparent he was just as bad, if not worse, than the old one. I only knew one person who was getting an A in his class. I was constantly getting at best a b or c in his class, and I was kind of ok with that. Then we started trig. My grade dropped like a rock. I had an E(lowest letter grade at my school, no F). I though I could fix it, but it was too late. The semester came to a close. 3 people failed that class,many others came extremely close. I try to not think about it, but for the past few days I've slowly been realizing what has happened. I feel extremely down about myself. My parents aren't helping much, basically yelling at me and taking away all my electronics. I just feel shitty in general about myself now.
