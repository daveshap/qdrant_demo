anyone else just staying alive for other people at this point?
i shouldn’t be so miserable. i have a roof over my head and a family that loves me. i have money and can afford luxuries. i go to therapy and take medicine. i have three pets (one a puppy we recently adopted). 

but i just want to die. i’m so lonely, constantly. my heart is so broken and i’m so exhausted i just want to give up and finally kill myself. but i don’t want to hurt my family. i don’t want to think about my dogs waiting for me to come back and not knowing where i’ve gone. i don’t want my mum and dad to blame themselves for it. 

there are some people who’d be glad to see me go. my older sister & youngest sister, most likely. my former friends. idk. 

all i do is disappoint others, i lose them. i can’t do anything. i’m so useless i can’t even kill myself. haha. i’m tired.
