MARK: Dan. And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne. You've been practicing.
YVONNE: Two hours a day, six days a week.
GRETA: Have another one, sounds like you need it.
YVONNE: Naah, I'm done. Got to be on shift in a couple hours. Aren't you going in?
GRETA: Nah. It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair. She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
