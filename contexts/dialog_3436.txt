DENVER: I want to work, Miss Lady.
LADY JONES: Work? Start learnin your letters again?
DENVER: No. I mean work work.
LADY JONES: Well, what can you do?
DENVER: I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
LADY JONES: Extra?
DENVER: Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
LADY JONES: Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
DENVER: No..No that won't do...
