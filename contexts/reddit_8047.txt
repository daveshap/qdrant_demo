I need some help understanding my grad school loan award
So I filed my FAFSA a few months ago, and today Columbia sent me their loan offer based on my FAFSA info. It's a federal direct unsubsidized loan. My first question is, what does that mean?  

Also, the loan has a fixed 6.6% interest rate. Is that a good interest rate? 

Quick disclaimer: I've never taken out student loans so I have no idea how this works. Any advice is appreciated haha
