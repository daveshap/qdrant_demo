LUCY: You've been avoiding me.
JACK: Have I?
LUCY: I'm Lucy.
JACK: And what do you do, Lucy?
LUCY: I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
JACK: Are you going to put a spell on me?
LUCY: I might.
JACK: Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
LUCY: Too much. Eighteen hundred.
LUCY: Where to?
JACK: Turn left at the lights.
