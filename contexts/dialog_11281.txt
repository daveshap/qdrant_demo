VARIO: If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
SONNY: But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie. You know me all my life. I've always done the right thing.
VARIO: You think that matters? You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
SONNY: But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town. I can't go here. I can't go there.
VARIO: You? You think you're the only one? I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
SONNY: But, Paulie, please.
VARIO: Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
SONNY: Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
VARIO: What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
HENRY: Tell him. It's okay.
VARIO: What?
