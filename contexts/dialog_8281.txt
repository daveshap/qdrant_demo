MADOX: Look, either shut up, or go home.
ALMÁSY: Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
ALMÁSY: Why did you hold his collar?
KATHARINE: What?
ALMÁSY: What? What? That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
KATHARINE: Would you let me pass?
ALMÁSY: Is he next? Do you drag him into your little room? Where is it? Is this it?
KATHARINE: Don't do this.
ALMÁSY: I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there? How can you ever smile? As if your life hadn't capsized?
KATHARINE: You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
ALMÁSY: Dance with me.
KATHARINE: No.
ALMÁSY: Dance with me. I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
KATHARINE: Do you think you're the only one who feels anything? Is that what you think?
THE PATIENT: Why don't you go? You should sleep.
HANA: Would you like me to?
