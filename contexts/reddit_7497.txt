Unrelated Thesis vs Directed Study in my field
Hello, 

I signed a contract when I was 17 with a university so they sponsor me to study my undergrad in the US and in return I would come back and do a MS degree at the university. 

I'm currently doing my MS in mathematics(did undergrad in Physics) and I'd like to do a PhD somewhere else when I'm done. I'd like to work in Symplectic Geometry but no one at the university work in this field. I found someone who work on projective geometry but it's not really something that's interesting to me. 

In my Masters, I can do either a thesis or take 3 directed study courses. I heard that a thesis can boost my chances of getting in PhD programs later. However, if I choose the thesis track, I'd have to do it on something that's not related to Symplectic Geometry. I'm not sure if I can do a thesis about something I'm not truly interested in. On the other hand, if I do a directed study for 3 courses, I may be able to do my directed study courses on Symplectic Geometry topics. 

Should I do a thesis in other fields or should I try to do my directed study courses in Symplectic Geometry? I'm the first in my family to go to college so please assume I don't know anything about graduate education
