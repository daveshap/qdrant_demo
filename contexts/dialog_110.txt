COLUMBUS: You want a war? Fine. We are a thousand. They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill? Which tribe?
MOXICA: We don't need to know.
COLUMBUS: We came here to stay! To build! Not to start a crusade. In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days! So we will be brave and swallow our grief. And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
