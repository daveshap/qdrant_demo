Indexing Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend
Andrew Yang's Universal Basic Income or "Freedom Dividend" proposal is to give $1,000 per month to every adult American who opts-in to the policy ([https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/)) (https://thinkprogress.org/andrew-yang-ubi-automation-profile-1b0957cc12b7/). Yang has stated the precise payout will eventually fluctuate by pegging the overall dollar amount to a particular resource, and he has made an express comparison to the Alaska Permanent Fund's annual individual payouts to certain Alaska state residents ([https://youtu.be/-DHuRTvzMFw?t=1478](https://youtu.be/-DHuRTvzMFw?t=1478)) (https://quillette.com/2019/03/06/in-defense-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend/).

Alaska's individual payouts are determined according to a set formula that averages the five year performance of the Alaska Permanent Fund (which is funded with a portion of state oil revenues) ([https://www.reuters.com/article/alaska-payment-fund/alaska-residents-to-receive-record-payment-from-oil-royalty-fund-idUSL1N11N03U20150917](https://www.reuters.com/article/alaska-payment-fund/alaska-residents-to-receive-record-payment-from-oil-royalty-fund-idUSL1N11N03U20150917)). Yang has indicated (in the clip above, a podcast that ran this Sunday; link is timestamped) that his UBI's individual payout amount would fluctuate with the profitability of artificial intelligence. 

Question: is it possible to treat an entire discrete industry as a resource for the sake of indexing the size and payout of a national social program to that industry's profitability? Do any other social programs in the U.S. fluctuate according to the success of a particular industry? Is the difference between oil (a commodity) and A.I. (not a commodity) relevant to the feasibility of this aspect of Yang's proposal? 

Thank you!
