Feeling like I'm not really improving myself at my first job?
Now this isn't necessarily true - I guess I just need some outside input and need to hear it from someone else.

I'm just recently graduated and have been fortunate enough to land my first job after a very tedious job hunt process. I'm working within Supply Chain and a very big corporation which is what I also majored in. The only thing I've learned and improved is mostly excel based, I haven't gotten a chance to really work on my SCM and analytical skills as most of my work as been report based or doing sidework + creating excel files from scratch.  


This is normal right? For a first job? I understand that I'm starting all the way at the bottom and I need to earn my role - but I just want to hear maybe what your first jobs were like. Do things really start moving once I hit my 2nd job after a year or two? Thanks!
