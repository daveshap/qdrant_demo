Im ugly inside and out
Im a fucking failure. What’s the point of even living a mediocre life ? Even my family dont understand why I’m feeling like this they say I have everything. The thing is I’m disgusting looking I can’t even look at myself in a mirror. Why can’t I die already ? I know people care about me. And I can’t even self harm anymore. I’m constantly crying for no reason. I hate my useless worthless ugly self and I don’t want to live everyday of my life seeing my miserable face. People who care about me they don’t even care or at least they won’t care long. I want to disappear and nobody remembering me. I’m a worthless human being not even good to look at and not talented. A lot of people have it way worse and I’m still complaining which makes me even more pathetic. I hope today it’ll work.
