Turning 24(M). Most of my friends have been in multi-year relationships and are getting married. Is it normal to already feel too old to date?
When I step outside and try to be objective, 24 still feels young. But at the same time, I'm starting to feel a little bit of that 'anyone who wants to be in a relationship already has one' syndrome and I feel like starting to date now is setting me up for single parents or desperate people looking to settle, and I'm not desperate enough to jump into either.
