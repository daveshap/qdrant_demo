SHIRLEY: We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery. Let's turn back.
BOB: No. It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
SHIRLEY: But does it have to be in a cemetery?
BOB: You wouldn't understand. Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
SHIRLEY: But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
BOB: Sure there are--and I've tried them all. Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories. Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
SHIRLEY: But horror stories! Why all the time horror stories?
BOB: Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
