Deleted dating apps — and I’m single.
I’ve been using dating apps since 2010, and I’ve had a handful of relationships but nothing that was ever too meaningful.  They’re not for everyone, and I realized that a littler later than I should have.

A piece of advice for anyone who cares to listen: don’t use apps if they aren’t working for you. Plain and simple.  Live your life and do things that make you happy.
