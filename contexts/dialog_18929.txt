VADA: Yeah.
HARRY: Totally groovy huh?
VADA: Totally.
HARRY: Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
VADA: I will. How's Shelly?
HARRY: Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
VADA: Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
HARRY: I love you too sweetie, bye.
VADA: Give my love to Shelly.
VADA: Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
ROSE: She'll be all right baby.
VADA: Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
DARYL: I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.
VADA: His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
NICK: Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
DARYL: I thought I told you to lose this guy.
NICK: Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
DARYL: I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
NICK: I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
DARYL: You're still asking me to break the law.
