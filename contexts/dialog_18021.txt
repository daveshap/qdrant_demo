ANNIE: I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
PAUL: I'm...
ANNIE: Done?
PAUL: Yeah, thanks.
ANNIE: No problem.
ANNIE: Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
PAUL: Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
ANNIE: It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
ANNIE: I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
PAUL: Well, I hope you like it.
ANNIE: Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
ANNIE: You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
PAUL: Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
ANNIE: I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
PAUL: I DIDN'T...
ANNIE: Then who did?
PAUL: No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
ANNIE: She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
