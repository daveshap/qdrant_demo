\"nuclear option\" for mold growth on ceramics and other tiles? I have to clean a long-neglected area that has mold growing on tiled walls and floor. Soap and a good brush is called for, but I'd like to \"fortify my assault\" with household chemicals.Is there any way that I might spray either a dilute bleach solution, or a dilute ammonia solution (never mix them!) to either first to make scrubbing faster/easier, or to post-treat to remove organics to slow down regrowth?Rather than talk about this specific mold, I'm more curious about a general practice here, using household products beyond soap and water to make scrubbing easier (I'm currently nursing some tendonitis) and/or to remove traces of \"mold food\" so it won't grow back as quickly.I live in a humid subtropical area, mold is everywhere, it's a constant battle.
