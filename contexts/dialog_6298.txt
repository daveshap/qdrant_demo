MILES: Do we want insurance? I'm just asking...
JAKE: Just mail it to the hospital. Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
GORDO: When?
JAKE: Tonight. Just me.
MILES: Fuck that. We're going too.
GORDO: Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
JAKE: Meet me at my place later.
MILES: How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
JAKE: I'm getting a ride.
SOBOZINSKI: The King, huh? Nice going.
JAKE: I try.
