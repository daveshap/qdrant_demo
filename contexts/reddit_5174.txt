After phone screening, was told about upcoming interview. Seemed to be ghosted, asked for update and now received a generic rejection
Basically title.  I had a phone screening interview with a company. Everything went well and she asked for a salary range, I gave her one and she said that would definitely work.  I was told that they would set up on-site interviews but didn't hear from them for over a week.  I then asked the HR person if there was any update.  Today I received a generic HR email stating that the position is better suited for the qualifications of another candidate.   Was it the salary range that caused this? I was fully qualified for the position based on requirements and job description.
