Adding additional dns search domains - is there a maximum? I've just moved to Ubuntu 16.04 desktop, I have added a bunch of search domains to the network settings (using Settings -> Network -> Wired -> Options... -> IPv4 Settings).It seems to have picked up some of the domains I have added, but not all. I use quite a few domains at work so being able to add them all would be really useful. Is there a way to do this? /etc/resolv.conf seems to have 6 of the 10 domains that I had added so I'm assuming that 6 is the limit?ThanksGuy
