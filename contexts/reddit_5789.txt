20 Little to no experience, Job hunting nightmare
Why is it so hard to find jobs? While going through the applications it asks for 3+ years of experience, Have multiple employer references, etc. I dont understand. I'm looking and applying everywhere, just hope sometime soon someone bites, Id work anything but no. 

What do I do? I'm really stressed. The only experience I've had are under the table.
