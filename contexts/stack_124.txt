Windows stopped working on Macbook I was able to install Windows 7 32-bit on my Macbook 2,1 and it functioned well. Not longer than a week later, Windows Boot Manager hanged, it was stuck on countdown and I couldn't select any other option, using the arrow keys didn't do anything, so I couldn't boot in safe mode, if somehow I was able to select an option (it would give me 1-2 seconds before it hangs), I would be greeted with a black screen and that's it.I decided to just delete the Windows partition and install it again but it didn't appear to have solved the problem, the installation would also hang 1-2 seconds after the blinking underscore, the same that happened before I deleted the original Windows partition.I noticed that if I wait a little longer, the progress bar for \"Windows is loading files\" is actually progressing, albeit at a very slow pace. When it finished, it would give me the Starting Windows screen, but no logo. Again, I waited longer and then I saw the actual Windows installation, no longer hanging, I could move the cursor and install Windows 7. However, right after the first reboot and I would be greeted again by the Starting Windows screen, it no longer progresses, tried waiting for it overnight and woke up to the same Starting Windows screen.Please help me, I've tried using a different Windows 7 ISO file and even tried Windows 10, and the same problem persists.Any help would be very appreciated.
