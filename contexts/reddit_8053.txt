I need to raise approx $1200 for a research trip to Angola, any ideas?
South African PhD student here. As the title says, I need to raise approximately $1400 for a research trip to Angola in September 2019. I'm going to be joining a group of war veterans who are visiting sites of former battles and, as a military historian specialising in war veteran experiences, this is an opportunity I cannot afford to miss for my thesis research.

Unfortunately, my department can only cover about $200 for flight costs but not the rest of the cost which involves 4x4's, fuel, camping, food etc. As such, I'm looking at alternative funding options such as crowdfunding or similar.

&#x200B;

I'm hoping the awesome denizens of r/GradSchool might have some other ideas for me or advice from similar past experiences, or even some tips for crowdfunding.

Any input will be greatly appreciated!
