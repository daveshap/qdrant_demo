REDFOOT: Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
KEATON: A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
REDFOOT: I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
KEATON: I shivved him.
KEATON: Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
REDFOOT: Business or personal?
KEATON: A little of both.
REDFOOT: Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
