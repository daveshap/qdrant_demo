Any careers that earn 60k or more with 1 year or less of higher education?
I’m a college grad (bs in chemistry and pharmd) currently practicing as a pharmacist. With layoffs around the country I’m considering a new career as the pharmacist market is over saturated. I’m open to new careers but unsure where to even start looking. Ideally I’d like to work prn as a pharmacist (much easier to find than full time) while obtaining a degree/certification/etc for my new career, but with my student loans from pharmacy I don’t think I could comfortably make less than 60k/year. My pharmacist salary was 140k but I will never have that again even if I continue to work as a pharmacist. 

So far it seems if I want to continue my education with my chemistry degree I will have to retake a lot of classes since I graduated 10 years ago. I have also never worked with my chemistry degree but feel like I would enjoy analytical or lab type work. I’ve also considered pursuing a pharmaceutical sales job or learning to be an esthetician or a real estate agent, but unsure what their salaries would realistically be (Tampa area).

Any advice on what careers to specifically research?
