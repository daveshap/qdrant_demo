CYPHER: Why you're here?
NEO: ... Yeah.
CYPHER: Gee-zus! What a mindfuck. You're here to save the world. You gotta be shitting me. What do you say to something like that?
CYPHER: I'm going to let you in on a little secret here. Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
NEO: Really?
CYPHER: You bet your ass. It keeps him going. Maybe it keeps all of us going.
NEO: How many were there?
CYPHER: Five. Since I've been here.
NEO: What happened to them?
CYPHER: Dead. All dead.
NEO: How?
CYPHER: Honestly. Morpheus. He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die. Little piece of advice: you see an agent, you do what we do; run. Run your ass off.
