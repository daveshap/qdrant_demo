CHRIS: What did you do today?
REGAN: Um........Stuff.
CHRIS: What kind of stuff?
REGAN: Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
REGAN: Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse. Wasn't it pretty?
CHRIS: Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
REGAN: Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
CHRIS: Your kidding?
