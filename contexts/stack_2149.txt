Connect to the same server on MooMoo.io? I've found moomoo.io recently and wanted to test it out with my friends. But we can't quite hit the same server.I guess it's something similar like Agar.io, where you find the socket in your browsers console and connect to it there, but I can't quite figure it out here.Edit: There has been an update with the party button being added. It worked for us some moments ago, but it has a bug at the moment that renders it useless. Regardless of that, I'm looking for a way to force join the same server without using the provided party option.
