BOOTH: Call it in I guess. Why?
EARL: Why? Are you kidding me?
BOOTH: No. We can't.
EARL: Look around you partner! You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
BOOTH: We don't know whose money it is! They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
EARL: Robbed a bank, c'mon! Don't you think we would have heard if one, two -- shit I don't know how many were at large! Don't you think there would be a bulletin? This is a big ass drug deal!
BOOTH: We don't know that.
EARL: Come on Booth! Look at these scumbags around us. Who's going to know what happened! Let's take it and get out of here!
BOOTH: Well someone's gonna find them.
EARL: Hell, it won't be us!
BOOTH: It won't work.
EARL: Why?
BOOTH: I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
EARL: We'll figure something out.
