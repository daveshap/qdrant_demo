JESSE: Thanks for the help.
COLE: After all you did on our farm? You miss it, don't you Jesse?
JESSE: The war? What, are you crazy? There are things I miss about it.
COLE: It was exciting.
JESSE: But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
COLE: Because we were good at it? Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
JESSE: Yeah.
