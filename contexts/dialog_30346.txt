JUDY: Thank you again. Good-night.
SCOTTIE: Can I see you tomorrow?
JUDY: Tomorrow night? Well --
SCOTTIE: Tomorrow morning.
JUDY: Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
SCOTTIE: Don't go.
JUDY: And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
SCOTTIE: I'll take care of you.
JUDY: Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
SCOTTIE: No, Judy, you don't understand.
JUDY: Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
SCOTTIE: No.
JUDY: No? Then what?
SCOTTIE: I just want to see you as much as I can!
JUDY: As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd take care of me"?"
SCOTTIE: Yes.
JUDY: Why? Because I remind you of someone? That's not very complimentary. And nothing would... happen...
SCOTTIE: No.
JUDY: That's not very complimentary, either.
