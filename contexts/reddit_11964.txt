I broke up with my girlfriend and I keep thinking about it
So I had a pretty special relationship with my girlfriend. I really really love her and I think she does the same. But in the last month or so we had a lot of fights. She started getting pissed off on rather pathetic things, arguing that I say stupid stuff and when I was trying to explain that I did nothing and that she exaggerates, she stopped talking to me a while. And, well, I had enough at one point. I randomly sent her a short breakup text after 2 or 3 days of not talking and she was clearly taken by surprise. 

That happened 2 days ago. I tried to not think about it and just have fun with my buddies that I neglected a little bit, by I just couldn't. I keep thinking that that breakup was way too sudden and that we should have talk about it a little more. I really do love her and I think I did this just to raise a signal that I am here too and that I need affection from her. 

Sooo, any advice? What could one do? Should I just wait for a sign from her and if that doesn't come, just let her go, or should I act? 

Also, we are going at a festival from 14 to 19, and we will surely interact around there, but I don't know if waiting till then will be a good idea. 

Thanks!
