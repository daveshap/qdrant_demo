PAUL: You want me to burn my book?
ANNIE: Yes.
PAUL: You want me to burn my book?
ANNIE: I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
PAUL: This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
ANNIE: Then light the match, Paul.
PAUL: No big deal.
ANNIE: So you've indicated. Do it.
ANNIE: I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
PAUL: You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split. God knows you're entitled to it.
ANNIE: Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
PAUL: You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
ANNIE: As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
