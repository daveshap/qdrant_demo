CROW: Look, I've put my family through enough misery. You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
ANDERTON: Crow. I'm not gonna kill you.
CROW: Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
ANDERTON: I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
CROW: I don't know -- I never saw his face. All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere. Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
ANDERTON: What the fuck is going on?
