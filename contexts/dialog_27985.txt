J.D.: Well, I guess I'd better...
THELMA: Wait...! Um, where ya going?
J.D.: I don't know. Nowhere. What are you doin'?
THELMA: I don't know. Nothin'. Took a shower.
J.D.: That sounds nice.
THELMA: Well, you wanna use the shower?
J.D.: Oh. I... where's Louise?
THELMA: She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
J.D.: That's lonely for you, I guess. I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
