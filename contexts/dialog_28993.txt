ANYA: Hope we're not intruding.
LOTHER: This is Miss Marsh.
ANYA: Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances. What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?
ANYA: Well--shall we go into dinner?
LOTHER: I'll join you later.
ANYA: And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh-- --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
SALLY: You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
ANYA: Sorry I can't return the compliment.

ANYA: I don't understand.
SALLY: I think you do.
