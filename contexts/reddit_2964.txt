How do you leave the steady career you if you don't even know what else should you be doing?
Hi everyone, I'm a soon to be 29M and I feel stuck in my life.

I'm from a small town in Central Europe and have graduated in pretty generic majors. However, I was very active during my studies and got a great international opportunity from an IT company. I've worked in several countries and am currently living abroad, working as an IT Project Manager. 

On the outside it seems that I'm doing quite well but I don't feel that I want to spend the rest of my life working in IT. I don't know what else should I be doing though. This job allows me to live abroad and have a pretty good life but it just feels empty. I'm not enthusiastic about my job and I don't see much value in it.

What do you do when you feel stuck? How do you leave the steady career you if you don't even know what else should you be doing?

I feel like there are some other jobs I could enjoy more like a journalist or academic teacher. The problem is that in those jobs you're relying a lot on managers, public institutions and so on + only the very top ones get decent money... IT gives a lot of independence and stability but it's just hard for me to feel proud or excited about my job...
