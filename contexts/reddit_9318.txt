As of this morning, I have no credit card debt!
I'm fortunate enough that I was able to go to grad school and do an online program (through the same university as my undergrad) that's cheaper than in-person classes, so my tuition is less than the Federal loans I qualify for. I've had about $5k in credit card debt for the last 6 years, ever since an abusive ex forced me to take out credit cards to buy him things. I've never made enough money to recover from the financial abuse, so this boost from the loans was a godsend. Granted, it'll all need to be paid back eventually, but it's not an immediate concern anymore and my degree will more than double my current income, so I'll be able to pay it back.

Obviously, most people aren't going to be able to trade 25% APR credit card debt for 5% APR student loans, and I don't mean to say that anyone can do what I did, but this is a huge weight off my shoulders and I needed to share it with people who will get it. Not only is my debt other than student loans gone, but I no longer have a daily reminder of my abuser when I check my bank app and I can finally start saving money to replace my car that is (quite literally) falling apart. 

Today is a good day.
