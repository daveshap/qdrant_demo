FROST: Beautiful day, isn't it?
BLADE: How can you be out here?
FROST: I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things.
FROST: It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, the Day-walker"."
BLADE: I don't buy it.
FROST: Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
BLADE: Maybe I don't see it that way.
FROST: Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
BLADE: You're wrong.
FROST: Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you. The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
