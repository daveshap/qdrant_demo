Fixed things with GF of 6 months. Text friend asking for christmas ideas, get told she has been seeing someone else.
"what should I buy amy for christmas? I want to surprise her"

"oh hey man, its been a long time. Umm, i dont think you should. She has been seeing another guy for quite a while"

Im in shock. But i mean, its long distance so what can i expect right? I guess fuck it or something. Its hard to put things behind you and say forget it when you care so much.
