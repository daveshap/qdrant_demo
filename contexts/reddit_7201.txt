Leadership/executive training programs...what to expect
Long story short, I got placed into a leadership training program, and I’m not exactly sure what to expect. We’re about 3 months into a year-long program, and it’s been great so far but I guess I’m a little unclear on what the endpoint expectation should be. This is the first year my company has done something like this, so I think everyone is kind of figuring it out together (even though several members of the leadership team driving it have been part of similar programs at other companies). I’m curious to see if anyone here has done something similar and if so, what has your experience been in terms of the opportunities that opened up as a result? 

A couple specific questions:
- I’ve received a couple promotions and several raises in the 5 years I’ve been here, but I’m not 100% clear on my own career path at this company mostly due to the way my specific department (marketing) is structured. How forthright should I be in my expectation for some career pathing to come as a result of completing this program?
- I’m obviously not looking to leave any time soon, but if I were to look for outside opportunities, how do you put something like this on a resume?
