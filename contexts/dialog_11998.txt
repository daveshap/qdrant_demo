FREDERICK: Like what?
LEE: Oh, you know what. I'm suffocating!
FREDERICK: Oh! Are we going to have this conversation again?
LEE: Yes, we're going to have this conversation again. I...I have to leave. I have to move out.
FREDERICK: Why?
LEE: Because I have to!
FREDERICK: What are you going to use for money?!
LEE: I don't know. I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
FREDERICK: Tch, oh. I always told you you would leave me. But...does it have to be now?
LEE: Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
FREDERICK: Oh...Lee, you are my whole world. Good God! Have you been kissed tonight?!
LEE: No.
FREDERICK: Oh, yes, you have!
LEE: No.
FREDERICK: You've been with someone!
LEE: Stop accusing me!
