COTTER: Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
NICK: <u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
COTTER: Why are we here?
ANNA: She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
COTTER: Who?
NICK: Whatzername--the psychic" Anna hired."
ANNA: Domini. Domini Von Teer.
COTTER: What's she look like?
ANNA: No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
NICK: So says her website.
ANNA: She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
COTTER: --how old?
ANNA: I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
COTTER: Then there she blows.
