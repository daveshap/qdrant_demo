HOLLY: It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
JESSICA: No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
HOLLY: He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
JESSICA: Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
HOLLY: That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
JESSICA: ...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
HOLLY: Yes. Oh yes. He was after you. I remember. You're running!
