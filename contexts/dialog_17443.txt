YOUNG MAN: Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
SUSAN: Not at all. It was fascinating.
YOUNG MAN: Oh yeah? What was 'fascinating' about it?
SUSAN: You and 'Honey'?
YOUNG MAN: My kid sister. She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
SUSAN: I'm sorry --
YOUNG MAN: Nothing to be sorry about. That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
SUSAN: What's the way?
YOUNG MAN: Nothing lasts.
SUSAN: I agree --
YOUNG MAN: Why?
SUSAN: I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
YOUNG MAN: I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy. He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it. One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
SUSAN: So you're a one-girl guy?
YOUNG MAN: Damn right. Looking for her right now. Who knows? You might be her.
SUSAN: How'd you know?
YOUNG MAN: Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers. The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
SUSAN: Me? Internal medicine.
YOUNG MAN: So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
SUSAN: I could be her.
YOUNG MAN: 'Her'.
SUSAN: Yes, I could. I have an office in the hospital.
YOUNG MAN: -- This is my lucky day. I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
SUSAN: Not at all.
YOUNG MAN: How 'bout another cup of coffee?
SUSAN: I've got patients coming in --
YOUNG MAN: And I want to get into my apartment and go to work. Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
DREW: I'm all excited --
PARRISH: Me, too.
DREW: I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop -- Instead it was --
PARRISH: Like a marriage made in heaven?
DREW: You have a way with words.
JENNIFER: Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
PARRISH: Hi, Jennifer.
DREW: So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
PARRISH: As close as a deal could be.
DREW: Olympic.
