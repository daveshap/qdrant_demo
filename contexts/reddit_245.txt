I need advice on how to help a friend
We're both f(15) in grade 10. For a while she's been smoking cigs (and even though I didn't bring it up much, I told her to not at do it too much at the very least). She just recently ran out and can't get any more since she was taking packs from her dad. She's now going through some withdrawal symptoms, and she's desperate for something else that'll calm her down in the same way. She has some other drugs at home that she uses quite regularly (some sleeping pills I believe), and when she runs out of those she turns to alcohol. I really don't know how to help her, since I don't go through the same thoughts. She also says that me and my friend don't really help much since we just reassure her that it's going to be ok. 

At this point I don't know how to help her anymore, even though I'm concerned about her physical and mental health. I've told her many times that we're here to help if at all possible, but I'm not sure what I can do anymore.

Does anyone have any ideas on what I can do to help? It really worries me that there's nothing I can do.

Sorry for any weird formatting if there is any, I don't know the difference between mobile and PC and this is also my first post
