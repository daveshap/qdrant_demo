Why are politicians calling for a Congressional investigation to Trump/Russia connection before law enforcement has finished their investigation(s)?
Recently, a number of politicians have called for an investigation into Trump's connection to Russia/the general influence of Russia on the elections:

I'm wondering if someone could explain exactly what they're calling for, since it seems like the FBI (and other agencies) already are investigating:

Thinking of many answers during the Hillary Clinton email hearings, can't law enforcement not comment on ongoing investigations during Congressional hearings?

Understanding that Congressional investigations are different than FBI/law enforcement investigations, what's the point of calling publicly for Congressional hearings when law enforcement hasn't finished their investigation yet?

Is this just political posturing or can Congressional investigations do things that law enforcement can't?
