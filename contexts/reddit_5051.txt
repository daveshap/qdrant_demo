Rejected from dream company twice :(
Five months ago, I applied to a position at the dream company I want to work at. Didnt get the job but was one of the top 6 candidates.
A few weeks ago I interviewed with a different team but same company. I just found out I didnt make the cut again.

Crazy thing is, I still have an interview at this same company again next week. Same position different team. I really hope I get it but Im worried.
Is it a good sign they are keeping me to interview? If I dont make it will I get black listed? 

Ive gotten great feedback both times the recruiter said its competitive but I did very well. It seems like I dont have enough experience compared to others. Its really frustrating.
