PETER: Shi... Sorry, honey. I was having the weirdest dream.
CLAIRE: Bad?
PETER: Weird. The book again. Sex spelled backwards...
CLAIRE: I must really be slacking off. Hungry?
PETER: Uh...sure...I...what?
CLAIRE: Sushi.
CLAIRE: I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
PETER: Hmmm.
CLAIRE: You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight. Quarks and dark matter, things like that. Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
CLAIRE: Peter, where are you?
PETER: Sorry. It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today. Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
CLAIRE: Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
PETER: Says she can get me in to see this killer.
CLAIRE: Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
CLAIRE: Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
PETER: No. Of course not. Mmmm. Anago. My favorite.
DEFENSE ATTORNEY: George, come in. What the hell happened to you?
VIZNICK: It's nothing.
DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Sure it is. If the guards did this, we can file charges.
VIZNICK: Not the guards. Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
DEFENSE ATTORNEY: You have to tell me who did it.
VIZNICK: I can take care of myself.
DEFENSE ATTORNEY: I'm gonna go make a stink. Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
PETER: Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
SMYTHE: Yeah, look at that sweet face. You'd never guess he killed nine people. I'm gonna get my smokes. Be right back.
PETER: You're too old to smoke. Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
