O'BRIEN: Oh yeah, real funny. Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
SUSAN: I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized. It's got to mean something.
O'BRIEN: Means? Oh no. We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
SUSAN: What's that supposed to mean?
O'BRIEN: Just giving credit where credit is due.
SUSAN: You have no one to blame but yourself.
O'BRIEN: Blame the victim.
SUSAN: Victim my ass! You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage! Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
O'BRIEN: This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
SUSAN: You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
O'BRIEN: I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
SUSAN: And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
O'BRIEN: But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
SUSAN: Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
O'BRIEN: And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
SUSAN: Just like old times.
O'BRIEN: Yeah. Old times.
O'BRIEN: I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
SUSAN: I'm glad you came to me for help.
O'BRIEN: I feel very emotional right now. A bit out of control.
SUSAN: Probably the caffeine.
O'BRIEN: Do you have something to bring me down?
SUSAN: No problem.
