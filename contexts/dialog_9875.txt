HARRY: How ya doin', Farmer?
FRANCES: Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
HARRY: Came to get a tan.
FRANCES: Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
HARRY: Kaminski.
FRANCES: Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
HARRY: Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
FRANCES: What?
HARRY: They killed him. They threw him out that window.
FRANCES: Oh no...
HARRY: Eight stories.
FRANCES: Jesus.
HARRY: Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
FRANCES: But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
HARRY: He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done. Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job. I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman. How d'ya like the camouflage?
FRANCES: You jackass! C'mon, let's get out of here.
FRANCES: Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
HARRY: I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
FRANCES: I know what ability you're interested in.
HARRY: Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other. For old time's sake.
FRANCES: Harry... I met someone.
HARRY: Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
