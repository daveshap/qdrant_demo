STACY: Do you think guys find that attractive?
LINDA: Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
STACY: Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
LINDA: What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
STACY: No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
LINDA: What variables?
STACY: Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
LINDA: What's the big deal?
STACY: Well I never did it.
LINDA: There's nothing to it.
