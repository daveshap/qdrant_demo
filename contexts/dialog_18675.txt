NESSA: Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
MUMFORD: What do you want me to see?
NESSA: Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
NESSA: What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
MUMFORD: If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
NESSA: I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
MUMFORD: What happened today?
NESSA: What are you talking about?
MUMFORD: Was it something that happened at school?
NESSA: These appointments were not my idea, remember.
MUMFORD: True. Should we stop them?
NESSA: I don't think you know what you're talking about.
MUMFORD: Uh-huh.
NESSA: This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
