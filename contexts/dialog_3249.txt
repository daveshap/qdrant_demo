DELIA: It's <u>Otho</u>!
CHARLES: Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
OTHO: It's bad luck. And I believe hugely in luck.
LYDIA: Hold your breath and we'll pull.
OTHO: That was the single most unattractive window treatment I have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
DELIA: I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, Otho.
OTHO: Yes, of course you are. Well, Otho had an intuition. Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house. And it certainly is. Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
CHARLES: That's fine, Otho. Just keep me out of it. I am here to relax and clip coupons. And goddamnit, I mean to do it.
OTHO: Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
DELIA: The rest of the house is probably worse. When can you and I get started?
OTHO: No time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
LYDIA: Otho, that's terrible.
OTHO: My sentiments exactly. Porcelain is for teeth!
