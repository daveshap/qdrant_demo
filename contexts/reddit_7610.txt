Grad Students Who've Quit and Got a Data Science Job...
How did you do it?

Ecology PhD and grad school is not for me. Luckily I've picked up some coding and data analysis skills, but not sure it's enough to land a data scientist or data analyst job. I have a bioinformatics project now which is my 1st chapter and I can still make "progress" during this crazy time but I am thinking of using it as a thesis and Mastering out. So my questions are:

Did you do a bootcamp like Springboard/Data Incubator/Dataquest?

Did you work with a mentor? How did you find them?

How many data science projects did you have on your resume/cv? What sort of projects were they?

Any and all insight welcome. Thanks and stay safe everyone.
