KAREN: How many of you are there?
FROST: A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
KAREN: What happens then?
FROST: The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
KAREN: LaMagra --
FROST: That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better. Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
FROST: LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
KAREN: You.
FROST: Who better to usher in the Blood Tide?
KAREN: There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
FROST: What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
KAREN: But you use blood banks --
FROST: Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life. Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
