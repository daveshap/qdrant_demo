LOUIS: It's Louis.
ORDELL: Did you get it?
LOUIS: I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
ORDELL: When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
LOUIS: I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
ORDELL: Melanie must be dyin' to see it. Louis.
LOUIS: That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
ORDELL: Not now, pick me up.
ORDELL: You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about. Hey, where's Melanie?
LOUIS: That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. Is it this aisle Lou- is
ORDELL: So what, you left her there.
LOUIS: I shot her.
