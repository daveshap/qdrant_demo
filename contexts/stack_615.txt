canon printer mg6865 install I already have a working Canon MP990 insalled on Ubuntu 14.04. Im replacing it with an MG6865.Ive installed (dpkg) cnijfilter2-5.20-1-deb.tar (which I used alien to convert from an rpm.In Printers, add printer, I 'Find Network Printer'. It finds what it calls MG6800, listing it as IPP network printer via DNS-SD. It hten searches for drivers, and asks me to describe the printer. It then asks me to print a test page.After that, the printer properties are displayed, with a device URI of dnssd://Canon%20MG6800%20series._ipp._tcp.local/The printer state is listed as idle - rendering completed. Yet nothing is printed. Same happens with print test page.Looking at the print queue, it's empty.However if I go back in and try another test page, it then changes its mind and says 'cant find printer. Printer not connected?'Im not sure where to look for the problem. Does it mean my driver isnt installed correctly, or its the wrong one? Or is the uri incorrect or the way I set up the printer settings not right?Where do I start?Can anyone help me trouble this please? (remembering I Have a working MP990 attached, and its settings look similar save the uri of course)
