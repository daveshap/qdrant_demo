How did those who failed their PhD or pass with zero publications get a job after grad school?
Tried searching around on this topic but all the career advice seems to be tailored on the assumption one has many connections, publications and a supportive supervisor/mentor. I unfortunately have neither. Hence wondering how those who failed their PhD or pass with zero publications got a job after grad school?
