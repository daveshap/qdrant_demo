JOHN: I need a minute here, okay? You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
TERMINATOR: Anything it samples by physical contact.
JOHN: Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
TERMINATOR: No. Only an object of equal size.
JOHN: Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
TERMINATOR: It can't form complex machines. Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts. It doesn't work that way. But it can form solid metal shapes.
JOHN: We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that. For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns. Then there were some other guys. She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from. So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader. Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho. Didn't you know? It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that. But everything she said was true. We gotta get her out of there.
TERMINATOR: Negative. The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
JOHN: Oh, great. And what happens to her?
TERMINATOR: Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
JOHN: TERMINATED!? Shit! Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
TERMINATOR: Negative. She is not a mission priority.
JOHN: Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
