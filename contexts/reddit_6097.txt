Should I apply to jobs during quarantine or wait til after?
My mom thinks I should be applying for jobs so that I can start orientation once quarantine ends, but my dad says I shouldn’t because of the risk. My mom thinks it’s a good idea to apply now so that I can get employed before all the jobs he taken up. Should I send out some applications so that I can hit the ground running once quarantine ends or should I wait until after quarantine is over to start applying? 

btw; I’m just a teenager looking for minimum wage work since school got canceled
