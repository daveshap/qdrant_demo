Am I justified to ask for my minimum salary?
I got my position about a year ago with a starting salary of 50k. About 4 or 5 months ago, I was going through some online documents while rationing out raises (Harsh phrasing. Sorry) for my direct reports. My personal file was available so I looked at it. It shows my min/median/max salary. The minimum is 64k. I was kind of baffled and called HR and they just transferred me around until I got to the head of the department and she said that 50k was the amount they decided on and because I signed the contract agreeing to it, that's the amount that I received. 

I have a few questions. 

Is this normal practice? I can certainly see/feel the economic value of undercutting

Is it justifiable for me to ask for my minimum salary? Or did I screw myself over by not asking for more when I signed on? I've never dealt with this stuff before so any information would be valuable. Thank you in advance.

EDIT:
What I signed was an offer letter. NOT a contract.
