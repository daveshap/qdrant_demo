How to determine if two categorical variables are dependent while controlling for a 3rd categorical? I have 3 categorical variables: country, gender, and liked (whether the user liked the content or not). Using Chi-squared I see that 'liked' is dependent on country, that 'liked' is dependent on gender, and gender is dependent on country (ran chi-square separately on each pair of these variables and p was &lt; 0.05). I want to check whether gender is a proxy to country - so essentially whether the graph is country->gender->liked or whether country impacts both the gender and has a direct effect on 'liked'. What test can I run to see if liked is independent of country when controlling for gender? (again the 3 variables are categorical)
