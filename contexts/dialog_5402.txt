CHUCK: Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
DOCTOR: Dehydration. Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency. Any or all of the above.
CHUCK: All I ate was fish. That's solid protein.
DOCTOR: Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
CHUCK: Which I didn't have.
DOCTOR: And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient. So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat. Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
CHUCK: I am one lucky guy.
DOCTOR: Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach. It's almost like schizophrenia. Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
CHUCK: But all that's behind me. I'm fine now.
DOCTOR: If you say you are.
CHUCK: I most definitely say I am.
DOCTOR: Doctor Hegel tells me he discussed the Vietnam POW syndrome with you.
CHUCK: Yes, yes he did.
DOCTOR: You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
CHUCK: Not to mention on me.
