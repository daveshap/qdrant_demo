BOY: Our man is sick. Come right away.
TREVES: What is it?
BOY: Like this.
TREVES: I'll get my bag.
BYTES: What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
TREVES: What do you mean?
BYTES: He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
TREVES: I intend to.
TREVES: What happened?
BYTES: He fell. He falls.
TREVES: He must have taken quite a fall.
BYTES: He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
TREVES: Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
BYTES: That's the way he sleeps. If he lays down, he'll die. Head's too heavy.
TREVES: This man belongs in hospital.
BYTES: Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
TREVES: You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab."
