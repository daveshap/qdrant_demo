RAWLSTON: Thompson!
THOMPSON: Yes, sir.
RAWLSTON: Hold this thing up for a week. Two weeks if you have to...
THOMPSON: But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
RAWLSTON: Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick. Go after the people that knew Kane well. That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts - I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
THOMPSON: I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
RAWLSTON: Good!
