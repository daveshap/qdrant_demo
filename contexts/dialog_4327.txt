ROBERT: Mind if I smoke?
FRANCESCA: Not at all.
ROBERT: Sure you want to keep those in the house?
FRANCESCA: I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
ROBERT: I thought it was funny.
FRANCESCA: Where are you staying while you're here?
ROBERT: A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
FRANCESCA: And how long are you here for?
ROBERT: As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
FRANCESCA: My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
ROBERT: Oh. How old?
FRANCESCA: About a year and a half.
ROBERT: No, your kids.
FRANCESCA: Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
ROBERT: Must be nice having kids.
