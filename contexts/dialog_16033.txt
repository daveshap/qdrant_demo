RAY: Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
CLAUDE: Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
RAY: You're soft.
CLAUDE: What'd you say?
RAY: I said you're soft.
CLAUDE: Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
RAY: I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
CLAUDE: Alright. You want some pie?
RAY: Yeah, I want some pie.
CLAUDE: Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
