MARY: Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
TUCKER: Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head. The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
MARY: Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
HEALY: Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
MARY: Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
