CLAIRE: I'm so sorry. Krieger was my call. I've never worked with him. I'm sorry, Ethan.
ETHAN: We did what we had to do.
CLAIRE: I'm going to try and get some sleep.
LUTHER: Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
ETHAN: Now I want you to hold onto it.
LUTHER: What makes you trust me?
ETHAN: Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
LUTHER: I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
ETHAN: Exactly, that's your job. Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open. What's the range of this thing?
LUTHER: It's hard to tell. I'm gonna have to be close.
ETHAN: I'll get you close.
