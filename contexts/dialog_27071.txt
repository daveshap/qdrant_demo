WILSON: Last time might as well've been the first. I remember all the times, don't I. Watching her grow up -- in increments.
ELAINE: She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost. Coming back to haunt her.
WILSON: Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
ELAINE: Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
WILSON: She used to tell me she'd turn me in. Little kid. Ten year old. If you're naughty
ELAINE: She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
WILSON: I know that. But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it? She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for. Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
