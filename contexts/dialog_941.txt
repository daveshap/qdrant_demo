NEWT: Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
RIPLEY: Oh. Sorry, Newt.
NEWT: My mommy always said there were no monsters. No real ones. But there are.
RIPLEY: Yes, there are, aren't there.
NEWT: Why do they tell little kids that?
RIPLEY: Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
NEWT: Did one of those things grow inside her?
RIPLEY: I don't know, Newt. That's the truth.
NEWT: Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
RIPLEY: No, it's different, honey.
NEWT: Did you ever have a baby?
RIPLEY: Yes. A little girl.
NEWT: Where is she?
RIPLEY: Gone.
NEWT: You mean dead.
