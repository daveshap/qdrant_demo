SHINZON: And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
PICARD: What happened?
SHINZON: As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
SHINZON: Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
PICARD: You'll acquire a taste for it.
SHINZON: It's not quite the face you remember.
PICARD: Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
SHINZON: A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
PICARD: Yes. The eyes have it.
SHINZON: Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
PICARD: How did you end up on Remus?
SHINZON: They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was... I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
SHINZON: For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
PICARD: You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
SHINZON: No race should be a slave to another.
SHINZON: You don't trust me.
PICARD: I have no reason to.
SHINZON: Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youâ€™d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
PICARD: And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
SHINZON: All I have is my personal feelings. I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
SHINZON: I want to know where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
PICARD: There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
SHINZON: Were we always explorers?
PICARD: No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth. It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
SHINZON: Looking up at the stars.
PICARD: Yes.
SHINZON: And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
PICARD: New worlds.
PICARD: After you, Praetor.
SHINZON: Age before rank, Jean Luc.
PICARD: So I'm not as tall as you expected?
SHINZON: I always hoped I would hit two meters.
PICARD: With a full head of hair.
SHINZON: There is that.
PICARD: Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
SHINZON: I know.
PICARD: If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
SHINZON: I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
SHINZON: In time, Jean Luc.
PICARD: In time.
VICEROY: This is a mistake.
SHINZON: He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
VICEROY: Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
SHINZON: My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
