What is the resistance to Sanders' amendment focusing on the lowering of prescription drug costs?
In reading the [amendment](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/sanders-drug-importation-amendment?inline=file) it proposes working toward:

>lowering prescription drug prices, including through the importation of safe and affordable prescription drugs by American pharmacists, wholesalers, and individuals with a valid prescription from a provider licensed to practice in the United States

That said, there was considerable dissent from the Democrats (not to mention support from 12 Republicans):

Bennet (D-CO) 
Booker (D-NJ)
Cantwell (D-WA)
Carper (D-DE)
Casey (D-PA)
Coons (D-DE)
Donnelly (D-IN)
Heinrich (D-NM)
Heitkamp (D-ND)
Menendez (D-NJ) 
Murray (D-WA)
Tester (D-MT)
Warner (D-VA)

What are the upside and downside risks to making an intentional effort to lower prices on prescription drugs?
