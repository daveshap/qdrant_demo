BRINNLITZ GUY 2: Oskar - my friend Lena.
SCHINDLER: How do you do? What can I get you, what're you drinking?
BRINNLITZ GUY 2: Nothing's changed. Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
SCHINDLER: Things worked out. I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
BRINNLITZ GUY 2: Now you're back.
SCHINDLER: Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now? I'm going to have a good time. So are you.
