RUBEN: The woman was in shock. She was totally out on ranks. I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack. Stop that, you son of a bitch! The place wasn't secure. I was doing my goddamn job! And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
M.J.: Don't try to lie, Ruben. You don't have the face for it. I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
RUBEN: Talk to Nikko...!
