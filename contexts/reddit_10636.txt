I want to be dead but I'm too much of a fucking coward to follow through
I'm afraid that I would hurt people by doing it but I already hurt people just fine while I'm alive so would it really be that different 

Stuck in a loop. Same shit over and over again. Meet people. People like you. People get to know you. People leave. Repeat repeat repeat. Don't bother falling in love cuz that's never fucking happening. You're a 30 year old virgin. You are not desirable. To think otherwise is foolish. You will be alone for the rest of your time here. However long that is. 

I'm the common denominator. I'm the problem. Always have been. Only one solution. The loneliness I feel right now is the comeuppance for how shitty of a person I've been. For all the people I've hurt. Pushed away. Betrayed. There's nothing left for me here. It's my fault.
