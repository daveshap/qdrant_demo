For me, having anxiety (GAD) is like a game of Snakes & Ladders. One minute I’m feeling motivated, focused, and hopeful. The next, it’s as though the floor is collapsing below me.
My heart rate increases. I start to feel like people expect things from me that I can’t deliver (even though no one is expecting anything from me). I’ve had people in life remark “wow, you really have your shit together” but if only they knew that the outside doesn’t always match the inside. On paper it looks like I could be an overachiever but I am horribly debilitated by imposter syndrome and feeling like I always have something to prove. I’m 37F and have come to realize that I need to live in peace with my anxiety and stop trying to yield it to me all the time. It has its own plan and I need to roll with the punches. If I fight it for too long I exhaust myself and feel worse about myself. On my worst days I’ll have to take an Ativan to cope with the zero gravity rib cage crushing feeling - but if I’m lucky I hope to make friends with it so the floor doesn’t fall out from under me.
