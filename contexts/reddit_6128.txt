Questions to ask the company when interviewing in the current economy
My boyfriend hates his job and has been looking to change for a while, he is on a second interview for a role in the same industry (Admin role in Advertising / Design / Video Production)

We're obviously concerned about him quitting his current job and the offer falling through eventually due to the COVID-19 recession. **What are good questions to ask the new company in terms of job security, guarantees, business staying active, etc?**

He has 2 months notice and is based in the UK.

Thanks!
