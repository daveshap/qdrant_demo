OLIVE: What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
HOMER: Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
OLIVE: There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.
HOMER: I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
OLIVE: I don't know. Just promise me one thing.
HOMER: Uh... sure.
OLIVE: Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
