Not sure how to do this
So I have this unknown crush at school right. I have told absolutely no one because I just want to keep it to myself. But I’ve been seeing a lot of stuff online about how the only thing guys want is a heartfelt compliment. I really want to say something to him because I genuinely think he’s amazing and want to make his day but I’m afraid that if I do I could come off as weird to him or his friends, all of whom I kinda know and talk to. What do I do and how do I do it? (...please)
