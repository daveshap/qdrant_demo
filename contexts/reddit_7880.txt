Looking for some basic info and feedback about MBA’s!

* Graduated with a B.S. in Occupational Safety (3.88 GPA) from smaller D2 school in Pennsylvania 
* Never been the best student but I really buckled down in college and found a love for education and worked hard for a good GPA. I credit making it this far in life from common sense and street smarts!
* Part time officer in the Air Force
* Salary: 100K
   * Project Salary: 125K by age 26 (step 1 promotion)
   * 160K by 30 (step 2 promotion)

Goals: 

I’ve always been interested in finances and the business side of the company. 

We don’t have a large number of professionals in our career field (Occupational Safety) that peruse advanced degrees so I feel like this would be a great advantage for me. 

I’m mostly interested in an MBA but would also consider a Master’s of Science.  

My idea is this degree would be great to put me on track for a Director position, Vice President, or any equivalent Executive position. 

I have the potential to open my own business later on down the road and I also do real estate investing so a program where you have some solid business takeaways is a must.

Given I may have to pay for this out of pocket I’m trying to find a balance between a reasonable cost and a program that has a good reputation. 

Is this realistic? Or should I just be looking at this as a check in the box and networking opportunity? 

I don’t even understand the rankings. 

It’s tough to rationalize when my undergrad is already making me 100K with 50K upside potential over the next 10 years. 

I’ll be working full time in the DC area while perusing this so it’ll have to be a part time or online program.

I will consider doctorate level degrees down the road after.

Does any specific programs jump out?

I understand most MBA’s have a specific focus right?

Do all programs require the GMAT or GRE?

Anything else I’m missing?

THANK YOU!
