How do you deal with a customer who cancels meetings at the last minute all the time?
I'm in sales and one of my contacts is a Director for a large company in our area.  I've been really surprised at her overall lack of organization and time management.  We have multiple projects that we work on for her at a time.  Things seem to fall through the cracks mostly on her end, but sometimes on ours.  I've started to play project manager for her in order to make sure things progress and so she can be aware of the status of the dozen or so things we have in the works.  I tried to setup a weekly conference call or meeting  (30 minutes).  I picked up on the idea that she didn't want to meet every week, so I scheduled them every other week.  The thing is she has a habit of cancelling an hour before the meetings.  Today she didn't even bother to send a cancellation.  I responded to one of her emails during the time we were supposed to be having our call and she says she can't make the call, but will still like an answer to her email.  It's gotten to a point of hilarity because she will cancel and then send multiple emails about the topics we would be addressing during our calls.
