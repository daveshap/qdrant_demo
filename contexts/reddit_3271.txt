Resources that will suggest career directions based on interests, strengths, and weaknesses?
Can anyone recommend online resources (ideally free) in which one can input strengths and weaknesses, as well as interests, and receive suggestions for career paths?

If I composed a profile of myself, would this be the right sub in which to post it to ask for applicable career suggestions?
