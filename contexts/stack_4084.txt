Lost all my ID documents and money. How to fly home from Spain to Slovakia? I live in Slovakia and went to Spain for few months, where I lost my wallet with all the documents inside. I got here with RyanAir and would like to go back soon. I only have police report for losing ID and photo copies of my documents. I am absolutely broke, means that I really have only money for going back, also that only barely.. I am in Valencia and it would cost over 100 euro to go to Madrid embassy to get travel document. That is even more than flight back home. Can you please help me, what are my options or which are the best ones?
