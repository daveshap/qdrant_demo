JIMMY: ... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
DAD: That's a doozy of a dream, son.
JIMMY: It was so real, Dad.
DAD: It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days. The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
MOM: It's all this moving from place to place. We're never settled. I'm having nightmares myself.
JIMMY: What kind, Mom?
MOM: Oh, I can't remember. But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
DAD: I know, Ellen. We'll settle down soon.
JIMMY: I was so scared.
DAD: Better now, son?
DAD: Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
MOM: Good night.
