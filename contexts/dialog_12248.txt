UNCLE VICTOR: They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! Throw the grenades
HAROLD: Jeez! That's a great story,
UNCLE VICTOR: Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
HAROLD: You think so, sir?
UNCLE VICTOR: Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
HAROLD: I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
UNCLE VICTOR: It's the greatest excitement in the world.
HAROLD: To pit your own life against another.
UNCLE VICTOR: That's right.
HAROLD: To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
UNCLE VICTOR: The moment of truth.
HAROLD: Another man's life in your sights.
UNCLE VICTOR: Yes.
HAROLD: ZAT!
HAROLD: Will they really teach me to shoot?
UNCLE VICTOR: Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
HAROLD: And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
UNCLE VICTOR: Oh sure.
HAROLD: How about hand-to-hand combat?
UNCLE VICTOR: Yes.
HAROLD: To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
UNCLE VICTOR: Eh?
HAROLD: How about to slit his throat?
UNCLE VICTOR: Well, I don't...
HAROLD: I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
UNCLE VICTOR: Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
HAROLD: Sir, how about souvenirs?
UNCLE VICTOR: Souvenirs?
HAROLD: Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
UNCLE VICTOR: Harold!
HAROLD: What's the chance of getting one of these?
HAROLD: Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
UNCLE VICTOR: Harold! That's <u>disgusting</u>!
