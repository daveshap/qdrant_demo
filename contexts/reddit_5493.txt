Marketing communications position without knowledge of Illustrator?
Hey everyone, I'm kind of new here.

I'm applying for a job in my field that I really, really want. It's a marketing communications position and quite honestly my dream job. I've been wanting to do marketing communications so badly. They don't specifically ask for knowledge of illustrator and any similar softwares, but they do want someone who has been designing for at least three years (only calls for ability to work with current desktop software). I've never had the opportunity to really learn illustrator or its equivalents.

So my question is: If this organization is only asking for knowledge of Microsoft Office, would that mean an avid Canva-designer like me (I definitely do not believe I'm as knowledgeable or experienced as a professional graphic designer of course) has a chance? Could I mention that I'm a quick learner and would be up to speed with their design software asap :,(?

Thanks in advance. :)
