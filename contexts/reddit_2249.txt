PLEASE STOP CHOOSING TOP TIER SCHOOLS AS SAFETIES JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS.
GOSH DANG IT KIDS this is going to sound like a rant but I PROMISE I’m trying to help you out here. 

It doesn’t matter if you have a 36 ACT and a perfect GPA. It doesn’t matter if you cured cancer and fed the homeless by hand for eleven years straight. It doesn’t matter if your parents are billionaires and your hamster has his own diamond studded Tesla. You are guaranteed NOTHING in the college admissions process.

I see so many people on this sub reeling after getting their decisions back because their “safety schools” were schools like Vanderbilt and Rice. Just because they have the lowest averages of everywhere you applied DOES NOT MEAN THEY CAN BE YOUR SAFETY. THEY ARE NO ONES SAFETY. THEY COULD RARELY BE CONSIDERED A MATCH FOR ANYONE. It hurts so badly to be left with only a few choices after the whole process is over, or worse yet, to only have one choice or god forbid none at all. A certain degree of confidence is needed to apply to all these top schools but please don’t let that cloud your judgement. You are guaranteed nothing in these situations, no matter how perfect a candidate you are. 

Choose a safety you like, but first and foremost make sure your SAFETY is a school you are ACTUALLY 99.9% confident you can get into. I’m not making this post to put anyone down it’s just that this seems to be a way too common mistake that isn’t getting addressed loudly enough for it to be clear. 

Tl;dr- Make sure your safeties are actually safeties
