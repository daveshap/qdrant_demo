ZOZO: Rutaganda's place?
PAUL: What's wrong?
ZOZO: Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
PAUL: You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
ZOZO: What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
PAUL: It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
ZOZO: That is why they call it coach?
PAUL: Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
ZOZO: You have taken business class?
PAUL: Many times.
