HARRY: We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal. Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper. But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere. Not even a scratch.
TED: Meaning?
HARRY: Meaning it didn't land in the water.
TED: Please. It must have flown here --
HARRY: It didn't fly here. It <u>arrived</u> here.
TED: Arrived? From where?
HARRY: Not where. When. 400 years ago. From our future.
TED: Time travel. I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
BARNES: What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
TED: Maybe we didn't want to come back.
BETH: What are you looking for?
HARRY: A light switch. A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
