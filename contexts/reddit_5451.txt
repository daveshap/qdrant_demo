Softwares to know for Architecture and Civil Engineering
I'm a sad 1st year undergrad student of physics and want to shift my major to either Architecture or Civil Engineering.
Due to the pandemic, everything has stopped and I want to be productive and learn a software which is both useful for Archi and Civil.

I've started Sketchup but I feel like I need a Autodesk certification down the line. So the main question is:

Which autodesk software to learn that has both uses in Civil and Archi?

Also, any other software recommendation is appreciated.
