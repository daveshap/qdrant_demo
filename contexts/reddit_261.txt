How can I meet with a boy from my school who is 2-3 years younger?
I'm 15yo boy, last time I'm extremely obsessed with one boy from my school. I constantly see him at school and I can't stop starring at him. He's extremely cute for me and I even wanna have a quite relations, and I wanna hug him when he would don't mind it
He's always along with his friends and classmates, so I dunno how would they react if I come up to him with my purpose to meet him cuz I don't even know his name. What should I do to not seems like a jackass when I come up? And when and where I should come up? I live in Kazakhstan and there are lot of folks which have a really miserable attitude to gays/bisexuals
So I'm scared of that
(and sorry for my English maybe I did a few mistakes though)
