I'm just not in the mood
For anything really.

I hate when I have to do the thing.

But I don't wanna.

But I have to do it.

And so I don't do it for a while.

Because I think it's gonna help me do it later somehow(?)

And then when I'm confronted with the fact that I have to do it, I have to do it under stress.

Because I wasted so much time not doing it at first.
