PILAR: I should get back.
SAM: Pilar--
PILAR: Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
YOUNG SAM: You going to tell her?
YOUNG PILAR: You going to tell him?
YOUNG SAM: He doesn't need to know all my business.
YOUNG PILAR: He's gonna find out.
YOUNG SAM: So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
YOUNG PILAR: It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
YOUNG SAM: You believe that?
