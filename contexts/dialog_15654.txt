KEOUGH: Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions. But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is. And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds... why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time? With you it makes sense.
HECTOR: They don't really attack underwater and--
KEOUGH: That Walt" guy got hit underwater--"
HECTOR: No crocodile has ever--
KELLY: You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
HECTOR: And what if I tranq him Kelly? He drowns. You think about that?
KELLY: I'm just saying last resort.
KEOUGH: Again. Not to be disruptive. Do we have a problem with it dying?
HECTOR: Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
KEOUGH: Is this a trick?
HECTOR: What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
