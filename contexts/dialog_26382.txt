GUS: But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
ROSS: A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail." And you are going to do it for me."
GUS: Me? How?
GUS: Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
VERA: Sister! I'm his sister!
ROSS: Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
GUS: That what they call you?
VERA: Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
ROSS: But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
VERA: It could make weather!
ROSS: Storms! Floods!
VERA: Blizzards! Heat waves!
GUS: How do you do that?
ROSS: Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
