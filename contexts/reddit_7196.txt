How long to get used to grill/assembly fastfood job
I'm going to start my 3rd day tonight and so far this job has made me feel dumb. My previous jobs were dishwasher and warehouse jobs. Those were less memory and multitasking based and more about physical endurance and speed. The only reason I left my last one was because I moved states and someone I know where I'm at currently could automatically get me a job, so rather than sending applications and getting interviews that could be fruitless, I went with the guaranteed job.

I've never felt so incompetent before except maybe when I started my first job, but I felt more physically incompetent, now I just feel dumb. It doesn't help that they didn't have a dedicated person to train me my first day and it was kind of busy.
