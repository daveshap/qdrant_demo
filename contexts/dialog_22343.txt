NURSE: I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
JULIET: Madam, I am here. What is your will?
LADY CAPULET: Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
NURSE: Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
LADY CAPULET: By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
NURSE: A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
LADY CAPULET: Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
NURSE: Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
LADY CAPULET: This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
NURSE: Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
LADY CAPULET: Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
