LLOYD: Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
MRS. DUNNE: He passed away three years ago.
LLOYD: Well he missed a great pot of stew!
MRS. DUNNE: It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
LLOYD: I liked it a lot.
MRS. DUNNE: Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
HARRY: Is it okay if he spends the night?
MRS. DUNNE: LLOYD, did you ask your parents?
