I think I may have a crush?
Olay so I'm trying to move on from my ex and I think I may like someone? The thing is, I'm not sure if I actually like him, or if I'm just interested in him to try and rebound and move on from my ex. I'm supposed to see him tomorrow and I'm just unsure. Hes kinda a fuckboy and honestly hes not that cute. I'm just conflicted. Idk what to do or how to figure it out.
