Preliminary/Qualifying Exams this Spring...
My fiancé is a first year student in an economics PhD program. His university has moved completely online for the entire rest of the year and he’s super stressed about the preliminary exams he’s still supposed to take this May to move on in his program (which typically has about a 15% failed rate and they usually do absolute scoring vs. relative). He has no idea what to expect or if there will be any changes to the program exams given this unprecedented and chaotic situation. He also hates being cooped up and can’t study in one place, which really sucks since we’re trying to follow CDC guidelines and not go out. 

Any advice/insight/tips/encouragement would be welcomed. I know this is a new and strange situation for everyone but just wondering if anyone else has a graduate school department that is more communicative/on the ball than my fiancé’s seems to be right now.
