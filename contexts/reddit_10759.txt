If you're upset about the election, the place to seek help is NOT by inviting discussion about it on the internet. Including here.
We know that the US election results are adding to the burden of fear and despair that many of you are carrying.  But this particular election has brought a lot of legitimate rage to the surface, and secondarily given others an excuse to unleash indiscriminate aggression against the most vulnerable people they can find.

We know that for some of you tonight might feel like the last straw.  It's completely understandable that you'd want help, but the wide-open internet is not the place to seek it right now.  Due to the amount of brigading, abuse, and argument they're attracting, we're taking down all political posts.
