Spoofing the OS version to trick a buggy installer I've been tasked with supporting a print shop using Kodak Prinergy 6.1, which is ancient. I need to install it on a new machine. The problem is that the installer has a bug where it compares OS versions lexicographically, so it doesn't grok that 10.13 is newer than the required minimum of 10.4.Is there a way I can trick the installer into thinking I'm running 10.9?
