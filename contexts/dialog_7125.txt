REED: Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
BOB: Are you out of your mind?
REED: Uh, let me get back to you...
BOB: You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
REED: It's a homeless shelter.
BOB: Oh. Excuse me.
REED: It's gonna be great. 'Caring about his wife.' 'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
BOB: I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
REED: Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
