Hi all, Ive been offered the opportunity to apply for a placement, but not sure whether to...
Pretty self explanatory really. I'm currently in the second year of my full time PhD.

I'm full steam ahead with everything but now I've been offered the chance to do a placement in Canada (I'm in the UK) and honestly I'm so conflicted.

On one hand, it's a huge opportunity, on the other hand I have anxiety and I'm not sure being in a foreign country for 3 months will be all that good for me.

Am I being an idiot if I don't take the chance?
