SHELLY: How old are you?
VADA: I'm eleven and a half.
SHELLY: It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
VADA: My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
SHELLY: It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
VADA: I think it should be outlawed.
SHELLY: Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
VADA: Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
THOMAS J: Hi Vada, can you come out?
VADA: I dunno..
THOMAS J: Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
