How can i improve my text game?
I'm a confident \[21yo\] guy, have hobbies, decently attractive, and am somewhat experienced in relationships (2 year relationship, 3 other 2-6 month ones)  but i can't seem to figure out text game. Texting just doesn't feel natural to me and i'm much more comfortable just talking on the phone or in person. Problem is, with online dating you have to actually get the person's attention and attraction to get to that point. I always try to be unique with my opening lines and almost always get responses. The conversation tends to go stale quickly though. It just doesn't feel like it flows. I ask questions about themselves to keep it going, only use genuine compliments,  try to find common interests, etc.. I've gotten the snapchat of basically all my matches but it never leads to a date.
