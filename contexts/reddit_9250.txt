How are you supposed to shelter in place if you cannot afford to stay home all day and must work?
I work a restaurant job that has been open during the pandemic. I have no car and so I need to take the train and bus.

On reddit, it seems like if you aren't in 24/7 lockdown mode, then you are part of the problem. 

But how am I supposed to take shelter when I cannot afford to be out of a job?
