FRANCES: Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
BEBE: I'd like nothing better.
BARNES: Well... come on.
FRANCES: This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
BARNES: Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
FRANCES: But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
BARNES: Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
FRANCES: You're right. I'm sorry. Okay, let's go get 'em.
BARNES: Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
FRANCES: So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
BARNES: Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
