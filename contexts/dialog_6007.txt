SALVATORE: Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
SPACCAFICO: So what's that got to do with it?
SALVATORE: The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
SPACCAFICO: What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
