Tonight I am thanking god for Planned Parenthood
This week I paid ten dollars for 3-4 years worth of 99%+ effective birth control. I feel so FREE and liberated from so many anxieties of being a low-income gal trying to build a future from scratch.

On my first ever visit to PP last year one of the first questions they asked is if I qualified for their low-income sliding scale payment option. Yup, ~they~ asked ~me~, saving the awkwardness of my shy ass having to bring up the fact that I'm doing the paycheck to paycheck hustle and asking if they had accommodations for folks like me. It was such a small thing, but made a world of difference. I've never been made to feel so looked out for by a healthcare provider.

Something that many people don't know is that, if you live in a large urban center, chances are there's a PP in your area that provides primary care services beyond just reproductive health. If you're struggling to find health care providers that can accommodate your income restrictions, I BESEECH YOU - investigate the services that your local PP has to offer!!

Ladies (and everyone with the potential of carrying a pregnancy), please please please educate yourself on different birth control methods and prioritize pursuing an option that works for you. After working hard at making good choices that will pay off for future me, I'm finally beginning to feel truly empowered and positive about the direction things are headed.
