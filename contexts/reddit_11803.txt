I wish I could rewind the past week and start over
The whole past week has pretty much been nothing but one bad thing after another for me. Last wednesday I got pulled over for the first time ever for speeding and got a speeding ticket that is probably going to be expensive. Then on Thursday/Friday my boyfriend told me that while he has tried to make it work and form an emotional connection to me he just hasn't and doesn't see us being together in the long run and thought we would be better off not as a couple. i'm pretty crushed about it because even though we have only been together 2-3 months I have never felt this way about any past boyfriends and he had even said I could move in and I had been spending most of my free time and nights at his house and I really thought he could be someone I could spend the rest of my life with so I've spend the last 3-4 days crying off and on and being a drunken mess or sleeping when i didn't have work. 

On top of that I have a UTI and I'm PMSing so that isn't helping my emotional state and the last 3 days at work I've had either shifts that started at 4am or shifts where I had to do a lot of moving/lifting heavy boxes and I started my summer college class last night so I'm physically and mentally/emotionally exhausted and just want to start the whole week over again.
