Name of YA anthology book from late 80s about Time Travel When I was young I used to check out a book from my local Texas library. It was an anthology of Time Travel stories. It was on the thin size, hard cover and was illustrated. It was in the YA section. It seemed to be brand new and published around the late 80s. The story that I remember the most is about a group of scientists that invent a machine that can peer back through time. They use it to watch Isaac Newton who then becomes paranoid and loses his mind. The pictures from that particular story that I remember are of the scientist watching Newton at work on a small tv screen and another one of Newton sitting in an insane asylum.  I've done some google searches before but haven't turned up anything yet. Anyone know what this is?
