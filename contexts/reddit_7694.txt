Advisor accepted a position elsewhere...and I was the last person in the department to be told. What do I do?
So, I’m in a bit of a bind. I’m finishing up my second year in an interdisciplinary (social sciences & humanities) PhD and, in the two years since I arrived, two out of the three faculty in my program who do research even remotely in my subject area have left. Today, after another round of coordinating emails with my exam committee chair (Also my intended diss chair), he lets me know he’s taken an outside position. Now I understand why everyone else in the department was stepping lightly around me today.

At this point, I’m left trying to re-assemble an exam committee out of a hodgepodge of faculty whose research is nowhere near my own. I don’t know how much they’re going to expect me to change in terms of exam list material and planned diss work—if it’s a substantive change I’m seriously considering trying to transfer or just quitting. 

So my question(s) are as follows:

1. How fucked am I?
2. Is it reasonable to attempt and apply for transfers when all the faculty collaborator options have departed for greener pastures? 
3. Can I (and should I) continue with my current plan and just bring in 3 people who have no idea what I do?
4. Is my advisor a huge dick for not letting me know sooner?
