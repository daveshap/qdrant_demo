Working in a Masters Program
Hi everyone,

I’m a first year grad student only hoping to go as far as my masters. I worked two jobs through undergrad and consider my time management and organizational skills are dialed. 

I was fortunate enough to also receive some rare funding for tuition remission based on merit. 

I’m currently working 26 hours a week as a paralegal but I’m drowning in schoolwork. I don’t want to let the school down since I was picked for the funding. It’s also in a program not incredibly related to my undergrad so I’m doing a lot of catch up work on terminology. Not feeling as smart or as pretentious as my classmates. 

Thinking about quitting the job I have since it’s really made for a full time person and trying to scrape by on loan money until I find something for like 10 hours a week. And my current employers were nice enough to make concessions for me but I don’t want to burn that bridge at work since I’ve known them a long time and want to keep that reference. But with all the assignments piling up I’m thinking something has to give. (were on a quarter system btw so everything is crammed short). I feel like when I asked around before people said it’s doable to work about 20-25 hours a week and now I’m feeling like that’s not the case. I’m not even in a STEM program!

Would appreciate anyone’s thoughts on this.
