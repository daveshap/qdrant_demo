GUY: Hi everybody.
TOMMY: Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
GUY: Guy... You probably don't remember me do you? I was on the show in '82. Episode 31? Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial? Crewman #6?""
GUY: Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
GWEN: Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
