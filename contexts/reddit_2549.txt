How do I get an entry-level job with a seemingly irrelevant degree and no real experience?
I graduated almost three years ago with a BS in Physics and went on to do a year and a half of grad school before deciding against the full 6-year commitment. During my time at grad school I had been getting paid only a bare minimum, and since I had really no savings I had to find income right away and ended up serving/bar-tending for the past year, but I am really trying to start my career.  

I’ve applied to over 400 jobs in the past month, but it seems like a physics degree will always be overshadowed by an engineering or computer science degree when it comes to STEM jobs, and my only real professional experience is a cumulative 4 years working in research labs (mostly in optics). I’d like to think I have basic programming/engineering skills and I’m really not picky about the field I go into at this point, the pay, or the position.

I’m wondering if anyone has any tips as to what I did or am doing wrong, and what type of jobs I should be applying for. Is there any way for me to advance my career without going back to school for a more desirable degree?
