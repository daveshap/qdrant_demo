I couldn’t stock up on anything, even if I wanted to. $100 for a family of six until next Friday (& schools been cancelled for two of the kids for the next three weeks!). Anybody here have creative tips on how to be prepared?
Trying not to freak out but hey, this is the age of the internet. I feel like I need a bunch of canned goods and meats and DIAPERS and pasta, and my finances are set up to only get us through like a regular schmegular broke ass week. This virus anxiety is creeping up on me, like being broke doesn’t already stress me out enough. 

Anybody here getting creative with preparing themselves? Are there some hacks idk about? What are you stocking up on, if anything? What can get my family the best bang for our buck? I know for a FACT there’s people here much smarter than me, PLS HELP 

P.S. feel free to post memes and jokes here. Need to keep a sense of humor to drown out the fear of an INESCAPABLE DEATH (Moana’s grandma voice)
