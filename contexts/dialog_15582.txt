LORD CHAMBERLAIN: The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
TENZIN GYATSO: I will not go.
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
