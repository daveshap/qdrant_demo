JOHN: You got a suitcase?
GRACE: Never needed one. I've never been anywhere. I've got a backpack.
JOHN: Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
GRACE: Where are you going?
JOHN: To get my car.
GRACE: Wait. What about . . . him?
JOHN: Put some clothes on him. When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert. It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
DARRELL: What you want?
JOHN: Open up!
DARRELL: We're closed. Come back in the morning.
JOHN: It is morning.
DARRELL: Come back when the sun comes up.
DARRELL: What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured. What do you want?
JOHN: I want my car.
DARRELL: You got the money?
DARRELL: Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills. And this morning you was broke.
JOHN: What's it to you?
DARRELL: I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.
JOHN: Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
