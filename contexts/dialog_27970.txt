LOUISE: Do you love me?
JIMMY: Christ, sure... yes!
LOUISE: Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
JIMMY: You're in Oklahoma?!
LOUISE: Not yet.
JIMMY: Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
LOUISE: Can't it go to any office?
JIMMY: No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office. I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road. And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you. I'll have to tell you the code.
LOUISE: Tell me now.
JIMMY: Call me back.
LOUISE: Okay. I'll call you back. In an hour. Don't tell Darryl.
JIMMY: I know. Call me back. Louise, I love you, okay?
LOUISE: Okay.
