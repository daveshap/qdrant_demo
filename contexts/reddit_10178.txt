Has anyone been suicidal for so long but don’t have the courage to end it so you end up isolating yourself from everyone so people forget you eventually?
I’ve cut off my friends for over a year now, but they weren’t really friends, just people I knew in all honesty. I never was able to develop a true friendship in high school due to my reoccurring depression and generalized anxiety. But now, I have no one and it’s mostly caused by my own actions due to deleting all social medias, avoiding social interaction at school and talking to no one. When you’ve given up on life a long time ago, you don’t care if you have friends, so I’ve been isolating myself until noone remembers me. Eventually, I will have the courage to kill myself and when I do, noone will remember if I was even here.
