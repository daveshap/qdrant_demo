MARY: Have you been up all night again?
MAGDA: Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
MARY: Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
MAGDA: These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
MARY: Meaning?
MAGDA: Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
MARY: You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
MAGDA: I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
MARY: Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
MAGDA: That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
MARY: Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
