GIRON: M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
GASTON: Um-hum ...
GIRON: You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
GASTON: Just a second.
GIRON: I hope you find the figures correct.
GASTON: I hope so, too.
GIRON: M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
GASTON: For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
GIRON: And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
