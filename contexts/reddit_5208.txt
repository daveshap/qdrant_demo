Bad idea to reapply for a job that ended in rejection 2 months earlier?
So roughly 2 months ago in June, I went to an interview that ended badly for lack of better words. The interview did not go very far since the company was looking for someone who was willing to work long hours, weekends, and long term. I was hesitant and HR noticed right away. The interview ended pretty abruptly, so there was not much of a chance to get to know me as a person. 

Would it be a bad idea to ask for a second reconsideration if the position is still open? From what I can tell, job spotters still see now hiring sign at least 10 days ago. I was interviewing for a similar job but, I would like this job cause it was a shorter commute and slightly better pay. If working long hours and staying longer is what I have to do then, I would not mind it to avoid long commutes. Does this come off as desperate to HR?
