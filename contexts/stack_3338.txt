Would The Fork, The Witch and The Worm be the start of another series? The new book is scheduled to be released at the end of this year. Paolini himself has told that it would continue the story of Eragon and Saphira and in addition it will contain other stories in Alaga\u00ebsia. Do you think this will turn in to a new series? Will it answer so many unanswered questions in Inheritance Cycle (like what Meona tree took from Eragon, etc.)?
