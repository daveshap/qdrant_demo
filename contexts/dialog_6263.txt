HELLER: Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?
MULDOON: What thing?
HELLER: Cabbie drove around all night. Three people got killed.
MULDOON: Oh, right. The guy flipped out or something? Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
HELLER: They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
MULDOON: So? It was a random thing.
HELLER: I never bought that.
MULDOON: Oh?
HELLER: Cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness. Suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself? Plus the victims weren't random solid citizens. They were all lowlives. Wiseguys. I've always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.
VINCENT: ...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening. Awesome. What do you think?
MAX: I never learned jazz.
VINCENT: God, are you always this prosaic? You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life. Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
MAX: That what we're doing? Flowing?
VINCENT: Damn right. Instinct, man. If you think too much, it doesn't work. Just listen...
MAX: I'm not catching a melody.
VINCENT: That's the point. You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise. Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now. Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over. That's not living. That's dying a little every day. Not me, pal. It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living. That's jazz. That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about. Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears. You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
