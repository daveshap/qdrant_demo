NICOLETTE: When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
PRINCESS: How do you know this?
NICOLETTE: Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
PRINCESS: He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
NICOLETTE: Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
PRINCESS: This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
NICOLETTE: A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
NICOLETTE: Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
PRINCESS: ...I wouldn't know.
