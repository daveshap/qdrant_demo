JACQUELINE: Who are you?
MIMI: I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
JACQUELINE: No!
MIMI: Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -—closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
JACQUELINE: And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
MIMI: I'm afraid.
MIMI: I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
JACQUELINE: Why wait?
MIMI: I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
JACQUELINE: And then?
MIMI: I don't know.
JACQUELINE: You will die.
