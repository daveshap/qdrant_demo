I Stay Up Late Every Night Because Going To Sleep Means I'll Wake Up And Have To Deal With Tomorrow
It's usually getting in to work that's the hardest.
I've  started zoloft again and hopefully that will get it under control.
But that anxiety wall starts building as the sun goes down.
What am I going to mess up at work tomorrow? What will I get in trouble for?. 

I think it just feels good to share. I'll get over the wall. I just need to make a few runs at it.
