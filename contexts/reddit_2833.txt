I got a Masters degree last year but am working retail right now - at what point will this start to hurt me?
Hi everyone,

I graduated with a masters degree last year in a field that, ostensibly, is quite employable. However, I'm the last of my graduating class of 25 to find a job in the field. My resume is getting me interviews and I've made it to the last stage of a few different positions. I'm working two different retail jobs right now to make ends meet. I'm almost 27. 

I hate being underestimated by customers (and supervisors) who talk to me like I'm stupid, and if they treat me like that because of where and in what role I work, no doubt some hiring managers will think less of me, too. At the same time, I don't want to leave gaps on my resume, and the places I currently work at are nonprofit institutions that could pique HR's interest and help me stand out from the crowd.

At what point is my entry-level research experience going to hurt me in my job search? Three months in? Six? Nine? 

Thanks.
