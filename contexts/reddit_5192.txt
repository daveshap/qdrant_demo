How do I turn down a job offer after salary negotiation?
I received a job offer in a different part of the country for £20,000. I initially turned down the opportunity due my current salary of £22,000.

The manager then queried if I would still be interested if they were able to match my salary to which I agreed. He then spoke to seniors at the firm and came back with an offer of £22,500.

However, after assessing the costs of moving and the cost of living in the new location I have decided to stay at the job I am currently at. There is also opportunity for a promotion that has recently come up which has also swayed my decision.

What would be the best way to reject the job offer? I do not want to come across as though I have wasted the company’s time (although I agree I may have). Any thoughts would be much appreciated.
