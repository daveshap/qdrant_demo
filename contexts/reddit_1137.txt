Does anyone here also worry they are cringey/annoying all the time?
I feel insecure and worry that Im not funny just cringey. People have told me Im cringey online but I just eant to know how to not be cringey. Any advice?

I also have a lot of self hate and self doubt. "Youll never be good enough."

I just feel so embarassed and ashamed of myself.

Of course Im sure everyone does something cringey once in a while... Im just worrying way to much. 

Thanks for reading

Edit: thank you all for your wonderful advice. Happy holidays and have a great day!
