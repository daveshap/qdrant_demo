Has anyone encountered the term "Letter of Motivation" when applying to tenure-track position in Europe?
The 2019-2020 job cycle is in full swing, and I'm sure many on this sub reddit are knee deep in job applications.

I came across a tenure-track position in the Netherlands in the humanities/social sciences. It is a posting at a Dutch university for a university lecturer in the Study of Religion, with specialization in Religion in Contemporary Asia. I'm not familiar with the European academic job market, but it is a bit different from the American academic job market.

The application requires only two docs: 

*  A CV including education and employment history, courses taught, languages and proficiency levels, and publications (if applicable);
*  ***A letter of motivation***

Is anyone familiar with what  goes into a ***"letter of motivation"***? This is the first time I've seen this terminology. I'm  familiar with what goes into a cover letter for a tenure-track position here in the U.S., but I'm at a loss in regards to this letter of motivation. What format should this letter be? What kind of content goes into this letter? Etc.

I would appreciate any insights and advice any of you may have. Thank you everyone!
