CHAPLAIN GILL: Why don't you just ask your question?
MALCOLM: You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
CHAPLAIN GILL: I don't think we know for certain.
MALCOLM: They were Hebrew, weren't they?
CHAPLAIN GILL: That's right.
MALCOLM: As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
CHAPLAIN GILL: Just what is your question?
MALCOLM: What color were the original Hebrews?
CHAPLAIN GILL: I told you we don't know for certain.
MALCOLM: Then we don't know that God was white.
CHAPLAIN GILL: Now just a moment, just a moment --
MALCOLM: But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
CHAPLAIN GILL: Just what are you saying?
MALCOLM: I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
