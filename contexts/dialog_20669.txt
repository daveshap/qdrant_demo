PEGGY: Ssh. He's great.
MICHAEL: Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
PEGGY: I thought I knew everything about him.
MICHAEL: Can we split now?
MICHAEL: I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
PEGGY: What?
MICHAEL: My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
PEGGY: How did it go with the pantyhose?
MR. KELCHER: It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
PEGGY: Oh no!
MR. KELCHER: Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
MRS. KELCHER: Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
PEGGY: He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
MR. KELCHER: Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
MRS. KELCHER: Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
PEGGY: Oh, you're both so naive.
MR. KELCHER: Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
