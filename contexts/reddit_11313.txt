I thought I was moving past my sexual/romantic frustration but now it’s coming back.
20M

Yeah I thought I was moving past spending hours thinking and crying about how I’ve never been in a relationship or done anything sexual. And now it’s coming back hard. Even writing that out...it felt like a bad memory. 

I keep thinking of lost youth and missing out on young love. It bothers me so much, I can only think of suicide stopping it. I can’t fucking believe the average age to start having sex is 16/17 and I haven’t even been in a fucking relationship. How does everyone do that? How can they manage to participate in being a sexual being, and I can’t? Everything I do feels worthless because I haven’t reached that milestone. I don’t even know if it’s possible. I’m constantly fantasizing about it. r/wholesomememes is so damn depressing. All of those cute memes are made by teens in relationships and I can’t fucking stand it. I’m a bitter loser. I missed the age where everyone learns about it with each other and now I’m fucked. Fuck I’m gonna fucking off myself tonight this is fucking unbearable.
