How do people work everyday in jobs they hate without wanting to kill themselves?
I mean seriously. I just graduated college, got a job and now I'm realizing I may have to keep this shit up for 20-30 years. At this rate I might not even survive my first year. How do people do this? Why would you want to work the rest of your life, doing something you don't like for what in the end?
