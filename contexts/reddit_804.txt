I’m unhappy with life.
I don’t know how else to say this but I’m completely unhappy in life. I try literally everything to make myself happy again but I’m seriously not happy. I want to go back to when I was happy. 

I don’t know how to make any more sense of this but I mean I have friends, family, a boyfriend. I’m loved, I live a great life but I’m unhappy. I don’t know why. I have everything I need. 

I seriously have a great life but why do I hate it??? Does this make me a bad person? Like am I being ungrateful? 

I’m angry when there are people around me. I love to be alone. That’s when I can actually get myself to be happy is when there is nobody around me. 

For example this last week I’ve been staying with my dad where he’s working and he’s only around me for like 4 hours of the day. He feels bad for leaving me alone but I absolutely love it. Then my mom brings my siblings down and I instantly start getting extremely snappy. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I love my family I really do but I hate them around me. I hate people in general around me. 

Am I crazy? Does this make me hate life?? What should I do??

I’m sorry about how much I bounce around in this post. I’m just ranting off my thoughts.
