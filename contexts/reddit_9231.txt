Right now after the holidays is a great time to go to thrift stores. People donate unwanted Xmas presents and get rid of older stuff to make room for the new stuff they kept.
Been shopping at thrift stores my whole life, this time of year thrift stores always have better than average quality of stuff. People donate older stuff that is still nice, just to make room for stuff which is brand new. It’s especially good if you want new clothes and shoes, there’s always lots of clothes still with tags people got as gifts but don’t like. Good luck!
