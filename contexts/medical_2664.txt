The patient is developing gestational diabetes.,Transabdominal ultrasound examination demonstrated a single fetus and uterus in vertex presentation. The placenta was posterior in position. There was normal fetal breathing movement, gross body movement, and fetal tone, and the qualitative amniotic fluid volume was normal with an amniotic fluid index of 18.2 cm.,The following measurements were obtained: Biparietal diameter 8.54 cm, head circumference 30.96 cm, abdominal circumference 29.17 cm, and femoral length 6.58 cm. These values predict a fetal weight of 4 pounds 15 ounces plus or minus 12 ounces or at the 42nd percentile based on gestation.,CONCLUSION:, Normal biophysical profile (BPP) with a score of 8 out of possible 8. The fetus is size appropriate for gestation.obstetrics / gynecology, biophysical profile, gestational diabetes, amniotic fluid, bpp, gravida, para, diabetes, fetus, fetalNOTE
