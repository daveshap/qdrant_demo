SIR WILFRED: If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
MARK: Sell my soul?
SIR WILFRED: Any student of Black Magic can do it. .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
SIR WILFRED: You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
MARK: Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales. Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil. I think that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it. There's a voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
MARK: Can this be stopped?
SIR WILFRED: Maybe before the event, never after.
