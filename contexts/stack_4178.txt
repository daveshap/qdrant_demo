Creating Language for a Comic Does anybody have experience creating languages for the world they are creating? I am world building for a comic, and I am by no means a linguist. If I could avoid making an entirely new language I would, but because the story is visually communicated through the pages of a comic book, readers will have to see writing at some point (like in town squares, books, etc). My only concern is if I draw scribbles on a book, it may compromise the reader's suspension of belief. Any advice?EDIT: The world I'm creating is arabian inspired. That means that it would make sense to create a language similar to arabic. Since I don't know how to read arabic, this can be somewhat of a challenge. I'm just wondering how I can get away with using a pseudo language based off of a language I can't even read in the first place.
