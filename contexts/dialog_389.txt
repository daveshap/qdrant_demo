DINO VELVET: Friend of yours?
WELLES: Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
DINO VELVET: Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
WELLES: He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
DINO VELVET: Bring the film, or we kill him.
WELLES: I'll get it. It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
DINO VELVET: How cooperative. Longdale will keep you company.
DINO VELVET: Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
EDDIE: Move it, dirtbag... !
