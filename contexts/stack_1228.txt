MySQL vs. MariaDB Binary Logging Difference I've been doing some testing with both MySQL and MariaDB and I've noticed a big difference with regards to the growth of binary logs - I can't find out much about this online.I have a test database, and I have written a script which simulates transactional activity (selects, updates, inserts, deletes etc) with the aim of doing some simple load testing and later, for testing point in time recovery procedures.What I've noticed is that on MySQL running my automated script for half an hour causes about 400MB of binary logs. When I do the same thing on MariaDB, I only get around 2MB of binary logs.All settings are the same, ie.Max Binlog Size: 100MBBuffer Pool: 2GB maxMySQL is running v 5.7 and Mariadb is running 10.3 - both are running in Docker on my local laptop.I've also noticed that MariaDB is a little bit slicker performance wise, I get more query throughput in half an hour than I do with MySQL.Obviously the big difference here is with binary log size. The smaller size of MariaDB means I can roll forward on the binary log much quicker for point in time recovery than I can on MySQL.Is there any documented evidence out there to support this behaviour? Is MariaDB more efficient than MySQL when looking at binary logs and recovery?Are there some hidden/non-obvious variables I should be checking that may be having a big impact on this testing?Any help understanding this would be great.
