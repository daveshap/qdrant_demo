Figured out why I don't get callbacks/interviews - violent felon with same name as me, How to mitigate?
I've been wondering why I almost never get interviews or even calls on jobs I apply for, no matter how good of a match it is. So I googled my (fairly uncommon, almost unique) name.

There were a few results for me, and a zillion for some other guy with the same name - mugshots and criminal histories (violent felonies). This is not me, and we don't look the same. Different middle initial, but that doesn't always appear, and I don't use my middle anyway.

So I imagine a potential employer googles my name, sees all those results, assumes he is me, and my resume goes right into the reject pile. Is there anything I can do to mitigate this? I suppose I could put something in my resume like "If you google me, you'll find a ton of results for a violent felon, but that's not me." But that's pretty unprofessional, not to mention it would make sure that in case someone forgot to, they'll be sure to google me and see all that stuff.

Anybody else ever have this problem? Any ideas? It seems that barring personal contacts or recommendations, I'm pretty much destined for automatic instant rejection for any decent legitimate job just because a convicted violent felon shares my name. Is any potential employer even going to try to figure out if that's me or not? nobody's ever asked me about it. I either get crickets or a generic rejection to any application I submit.

\[edit to add\] Also, this person has a different birthdate, so it isn't a problem during a legitimate background check, which I can and have successfully passed. But if they reject me on a simple google search, I'll never make it to a real BG check.
