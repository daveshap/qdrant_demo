LINDA: God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
STACY: I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
LINDA: You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
STACY: I don't know... I just don't feel right.
LINDA: What do you think it is?
STACY: What do you think it is?
LINDA: It couldn't be.
STACY: It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
LINDA: Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
STACY: I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
LINDA: But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
STACY: You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
LINDA: What?
STACY: You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
LINDA: You're right. I didn't tell you that.
DAMONE: What's going on?
STACY: Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
DAMONE: What? Now?
DAMONE: Why don't you call me up tonight?
STACY: Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
DAMONE: How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
STACY: I know it's yours.
