How do you get back into the working world with severe depression and anxiety?
I’ve been out of work since August when I had a major breakdown and attempted suicide in September. I’m on new meds and back in therapy. I want to find something part time and ease myself back into things but I find myself panicking at the thought of human interaction outside of my small circle. 

I’m able to mostly go to the store, run errands, etc without a panic attack now. The depression is better but still bad. But I have such a hard time functioning normally (smiling, responding appropriately, etc.) with the public that idk how I’m going to manage a job. But I hate not working, not providing for myself and my kids, and I need to find a job again soon.
