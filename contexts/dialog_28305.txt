TED: I don't know about this, Dom.
DOM: Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
TED: His mother?
DOM: Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
TED: And you think he could find out her number for me?
DOM: He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
