BOB: See you at the wedding.
IKE: You bet ya, Coach.
MAGGIE: At the wedding? You invite him? Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
BOB: Sure I do. But the bet defense is a good offense, right? You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
MAGGIE: You don't understand this guy.
BOB: Let him come to the wedding. You're not running, right? Say it. I'm not...""
MAGGIE: I'm not running.
BOB: So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right? All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
MAGGIE: I've got news for you. No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
