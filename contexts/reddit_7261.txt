Stressed about new ice cream job
I just started training, this is my first job. The job is pretty much nothing like what I expected it to be. I really liked this place as a kid so I was excited to work there. The place is very messy, despite what customers see. You are expected to work alone and the manager is pretty much never there. It is empty 90% of the time and you just have to sit there and wait for people to come. Most of the people who come in look they read way too much Yelp, and they can be very rude.

Ice cream out of the freezer is very stiff and with my weak arms I can barely get it out, although I only tried once. I don’t know how to use the register and am worried about making coffee and milkshakes. There’s so much to learn yet they expect you to do and learn everything by yourself. Training barely helps because there are almost no customers to use as examples. And you don’t even get paid for training!!!

I feel so worried about this and I’m not sure if it was a good choice, but it was my dream job. Tomorrow is my 2nd day of training. Any tips/advice?
