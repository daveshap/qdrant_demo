CLEMENTINE: I'm so excited. Yay!
PATRICK: I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
PATRICK: I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
CLEMENTINE: It's gorgeous. Just my taste. I've never gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked. Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
CLEMENTINE: Such a beautiful view.
JOEL: Yes indeed. Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
CLEMENTINE: Oh?
JOEL: I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
CLEMENTINE: Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
JOEL: I don't know.
