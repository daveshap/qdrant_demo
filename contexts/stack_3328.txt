Is this character\u2019s name a reference? In the new Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, towards the end, a character is revealed who bears the name of<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   Aurelius Dumbledore.</blockquote>Now, it is fairly well-known that the actor who played<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   Albus Dumbledore in the first two Harry Potter movies, namely Richard Harris,</blockquote>also played the character of<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   Marcus Aurelius in the movie Gladiator (2000).</blockquote>Has anyone \u2013 either JKR herself or the director or someone else in the know \u2013 mentioned whether the naming of the character in FB:TCoG (I suggest a shorter acronym in future \u2013 perhaps just CoG?) is a conscious reference to that earlier character, or whether it is just coincidence?
