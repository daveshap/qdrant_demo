DOOM: No matter. I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes. By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
VALIANT: So you're Cloverleaf?
DOOM: No one person is Cloverleaf. We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
VALIANT: Come on, Doom. What would a company like that want with Toontown?
DOOM: It wasn't Toontown they wanted. It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
