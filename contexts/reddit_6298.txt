Went to my first day of work and was sent back home.
I was hired last Tuesday as an entry-level data analyst at a small company (~50 employees). The CEO handled all the interviews and hiring process, so I'm guessing there isn't a formal HR team in the company. Last Tuesday, the CEO told me to start the following Monday, yesterday, and to give him a call on Friday to confirm my start date. Here is when everything went wrong.

I soon realized that Monday was Memorial Day and wasn't sure if the CEO had forgotten that it was a holiday or if the office was open. I planned on asking him during the confirmation call on Friday but he didn't pick up all three times. So I sent him an email on Friday but never got a response even till today.

I went to work yesterday, just in case, but the whole building was closed for memorial day. I was honestly fine and went in again today. I was then told that the guy responsible for my training called in sick and told me to go back home. I asked one of the directors there if she was aware of my hiring but she said no. I'm guessing the CEO didn't tell anyone that I was hired. So no one expected me to be there. She also told me that the CEO would be out this whole week because he's attending a conference. Then she said she'll straighten things out and give me a call later today but I never received a phone call.

I'm now unsure when or if I will even start working there. I rejected one interview after being hired and received one more interview request over the weekend but can't give them any response because I'm not sure what'll happen at this place. I'm pretty sure I was hired here because they deleted the job listing on Indeed after hiring me. I like this place but this whole hiring process has been very frustrating.
