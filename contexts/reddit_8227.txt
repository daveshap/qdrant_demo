Were Sen. Ted Cruz' criticisms of the relief bill for Hurricane Sandy as funding "pork projects" accurate?
Senator Cruz and several congresspersons from Texas voted against the Hurricane Sandy relief bill of 2013. At the time, and also now that subject is coming up in the wake of hurricane Harvey, [Senator Cruz defended his "nay" vote by alleging the bill contained excessive amounts of funding for things that were not disaster relief.](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/28/texas-hurricane-harvey-hypocrisy-cruz-242098). How accurate is this assertion?
