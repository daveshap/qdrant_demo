Looking for audio player which not scanning audio files My question is in the title.I try to find an audio player which does not scanning my music library, but which allows me to select some tracks in a folder (in a embedded browser) in order to read it. If it could also save the paths of my different music folders, it would be perfect. In brief, I'm looking for an old-fashion audio player.I've tested a lot of ones, but without success. Until now, under 14.04, I used Decibel-audio-player. It was definitely the lighter and the more useful audio player I have ever used. But, well, it is not maintained anymore. Yes, it is quite sad. :-(So, which other audio player can suit me ? Any ideas are welcome. It could be, if nothing else exists, a \"lot of features\" audio player with a dedicated plugin.Thanks a lot.
