LOIS: Well...flashlight?
SUPERMAN: I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
LOIS: If I do, you can punish me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks. This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
SUPERMAN: Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
LOIS: Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
