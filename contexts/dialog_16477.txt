RAQUEL: Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
MARIAN: How could I miss it? The TV won't quit with that stuff.
RAQUEL: They're gonna cook him.
MARIAN: Andy's from Utah. He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
RAQUEL: Which would you choose?
MARIAN: Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
RAQUEL: Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
MARIAN: The heart, I guess.
RAQUEL: I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
