ERIN: You want my number?
GEORGE: I do.
ERIN: Which number do you want, George?
GEORGE: You got more than one?
ERIN: Shit, yeah. I got numbers coming out of my ears. Like, for instance, ten.
GEORGE: Ten?
ERIN: Sure. That's one of my numbers. It's how many months old my little girl is.
GEORGE: You got a little girl?
ERIN: Yeah. Sexy, huh? And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is. Seven is my son's age. Two is how many times I been married and divorced. You getting all this? 16 is the number of dollars in my bank account. 454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
