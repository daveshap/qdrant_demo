DEMILLE: I hate to think where that puts me. I could be her father.
1ST ASSISTANT: I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
DEMILLE: It must be about that appalling script of hers. What can I say to her? What can I say?
1ST ASSISTANT: I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room. I can give her the brush ...
DEMILLE: Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
1ST ASSISTANT: I didn't mean to --
DEMILLE: Of course you didn't. You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
1ST ASSISTANT: I hear she was a terror to work with.
DEMILLE: She got to be. A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit. Hold everything.
NORMA: Don't you want to come along, darling?
GILLIS: I don't think so. It's your script. It's your show. Good luck.
NORMA: Thank you, darling.
DE MILLE: Hello, young fellow.
NORMA: Hello, Mr. deMille.
NORMA: Last time I saw you was someplace very gay. I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
DE MILLE: Lots of people were. Lindbergh had just landed in Paris. Come on in.
DE MILLE: Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
NORMA: You'd better. I'm very angry.
DE MILLE: I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
NORMA: That's no excuse. You read the script, didn't you?
DE MILLE: Yes, I did.
NORMA: Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
DE MILLE: What assistant?
NORMA: Don't play innocent. Somebody named Gordon Cole.
DE MILLE: Gordon Cole?
NORMA: And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
DE MILLE: Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal. Make yourself comfortable.
