Extra aggravating crush
I am freshly 18, and ive never ever been interested in someone more than a year younger than me before, but now im interested in a 14 year old who i think is also interested in me.

I thought he was 16ish, not 14, when we started talking, he kept making sexual comments to only me, no one else in our group. Me and him have similar interests and sense of humor, he acts and looks like hes just a year or two younger than me, not 3 and a half... I feel like an awful person for feeling this way but i thought he was older when it developed and the crush has stuck.

Opinions on this and what to do :(
