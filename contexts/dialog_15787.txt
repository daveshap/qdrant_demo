BEN: If I was I'm sorry.
SERA: No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
BEN: I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
BEN: Don't run away.
SERA: Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
SERA: What's up?
BEN: I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
BEN: ...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
SERA: Are you serious.
BEN: I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
SERA: No, I can't have dinner with you.
