DWAYNE: All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
JESSE: No. But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
DWAYNE: Dammit you’re persistent. I don’t want to listen to this anymore. No more bets with you.
JESSE: Aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!
DWAYNE: Take it or leave it.
