DET. BRADFORD: Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
MOM: Yes, I did.
DAD: Detectives, what is this about?
DET. MOORE: I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
DAD: Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
SCOTTY: SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
MOM: From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
MISTY: I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
DAD: Misty, that's a terrible thing to say! Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
MOM: Murder, honey.
SCOTTY: Now, here's a babe!
