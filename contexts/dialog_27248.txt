KURTZWEIL: Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
MULDER: Do I know you?
KURTZWEIL: No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
MULDER: You follow me out here for a reason?
KURTZWEIL: Yeah, I did.
KURTZWEIL: My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
MULDER: I know the name. Why?
KURTZWEIL: Old friend of your father's.
