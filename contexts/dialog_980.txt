DE VRIES: Hey, Guttierez?
GUTTIEREZ: What?
DE VRIES: Take a look at this.
GUTTIEREZ: One of 'em must have escaped.
DE VRIES: That's impossible, man. This fence is high-tensile. The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
GUTTIEREZ: There's no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
DE VRIES: Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
GUTTIEREZ: That's a fact.
GUTTIEREZ: Whoa, wait a minute...
DE VRIES: What?
GUTTIEREZ: Just got a reading...
KAMEN: How's it going?
PARSONS: Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
PARSONS: Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
KAMEN: You should hit the sack, too.
PARSONS: Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
KAMEN: What time's sundown?
PARSONS: 'Bout five minutes.
KAMEN: Give me a yell is something happens.
PARSONS: You got it, cowboy.
