Paid Internship Tips
Apologies in advance for the WC, but I’m a rising junior at UIUC pursuing a dual degree in Accounting & Supply Chain Management. After 4 semesters of school I’ve already completed 89/150 credit hours for my two degrees, I’ve worked creating/selling custom apparel, as a brand ambassador, as a server in a restaurant, and I am the President of a consulting club and have worked with large clients such as the former St. Louis BattleHawks of the XFL. I already have a 2021 internship lined up with KPMG but if I don’t get something this summer then it’s going to be especially difficult for me to afford living expenses for next year. 

I had an internship lined up for this summer but it has been rescinded due to covid-19. I currently have 37 applications pending for various paid internship from finance to sales to accounting to supply chain/operations but I haven’t heard anything back yet. I’ve gone through the hundreds of jobs in Handshake, Illinois Job Link, and Angel List and have applied to everything that I felt I would be remotely qualified for/could learn quickly. 

I live near Chicago so there should be at least something available, right? What are some tips for trying to find a paid internship this summer? Should I go through more job boards? 

I’m beginning to feel pretty hopeless about this search and I really don’t know what to do since restaurants in Illinois will be closed for at least another month and my local grocery stores are not currently hiring. 

I’ve failed a lot before but it’s always been for a reason or something that I could learn from. If I can’t get a paid job this summer then it feels like I failed for no reason and that’s a terrifying thought
