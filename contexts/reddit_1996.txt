Words from a parent of T20 qualified kids. Make the best of your situation!
Parent here of two kids who got into Purdue and UMich and got rejected from MITx2/UIUC/Stanfordx2.

If you are in the mix and have the stats and have a chance to afford it, you've got to apply. You owe it to yourself to take your shot and while you are likely to be rejected, you gave yourself a shot.

My father and I both graduated from MIT and my kids were hit hard when they got rejected, but they were in the arena and had a legitimate chance to make it. 1960s MIT was very different from 1980s MIT, which was very different from today's MIT, but I would have done anything to have my kids go there.

That being said, you shoot your shot and you make the best of where you end up. There is way too much emphasis on picking your 'fit' in advance. More emphasis should be placed on resilience and deciding that where you end up is the 'right' place. Lay your acceptances out in front of you and pick the best academic/financial/future prospects place for you and the \*decide\* that your choice will be your future.

Make it your place for success.

My son ended up transferring out of Purdue. My Daughter is navigating the virus at Michigan, but I am confident that they are both finding their way through the vagaries of life, starting in college. Life will never follow your plan. You are best served by picking your best option at the given time and planning to adapt to what life presents to you.

You have done well to be in the mix. Enjoy the excitement and then deal with the results. You'll be at a great place and its up to you to make the most of it!

Sincerely, someone else's Dad.
