CUERVO JONES: Where is he?
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE: He jumped. Down there. He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
CUERVO JONES: Give it to me.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE: You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
CUERVO JONES: Give it.
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE: Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
