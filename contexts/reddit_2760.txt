How does one find work they enjoy?
Ive basically never had a job that i actually felt passionate about. Ive always worked to survive. Tryna figure out what work wont leave me bored and depressed. 

I am realizing that i am creative, & empathetic, and have always tried to push that away. I like helping ppl. I get sick of “selling”. 

What are ur stories? How did you find a great career?
