GEORGIE: Ed! What's with these revised pages?! A scene in a smelting factory? A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??! What's going on here? I can't afford to film this nonsense!
ED: Don't worry. We're not gonna film any of it.
GEORGIE: <u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
ED: I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free. This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
