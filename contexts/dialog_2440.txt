STAN: Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
RICK: Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
STAN: Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
RICK: Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
