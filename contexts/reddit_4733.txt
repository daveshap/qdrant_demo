passively suicidal
i feel like i’ve been passively suicidal since a very early age with moments of being actively suicidal. what i mean by this is that i’m pretty much wanting to die at any moment but not always to the point of actually doing anything about it. i can’t live like this anymore. i know it’ll still happen occasionally, but i just want some time where i don’t wish i were dead. i don’t know my dudes. i just feel so lost. 

edit: i really appreciate all the support. it’s nice to feel not alone. i hope you all know i support all of you too. 

edit: i’m looking for a new therapist so hopefully i can find a good match and start the process of coping. i’ve previously had a couple (one moved, one was a complicated situation and i had to leave after she failed to report that i had been raped and i was still a minor). i have major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder following being raped at 16.
