Esri ArcObjects SOE For my prototype I have published a service with one layer.  The layer has 3 polygons with an entitlement attribute.  Only one polygons entitlement is set to true.  I need to write an SOE (in Java) to draw the polygons return an image, the polygon with the attribute set to true needs to be drawn differently, maybe a thicker line or an additional inner border or something along those lines.  Unfortunately  I don't have the luxury of drawing the polygons client side due to the shear volume of features.EDIT: SOE is required to cater for our complex entitlement needs.I've worked through the bundled SDK samples but can't find anything appropriate.So my questions are:Can an SOE return an image?  I've been experimenting with the REST request appending &amp;format=image but I just cant get my SOE to return a pngis it possible to style particular features differently based on an attribute?  If so, how would I update the legend to include the different styled feature
