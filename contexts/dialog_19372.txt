UNCLE ELROY: Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
CRAIG: I don't know!
UNCLE ELROY: Suga!
SUGA: Huh?
UNCLE ELROY: What you doing to my nephew?
SUGA: Ah, baby...I thought this was you. Craig, what are you doing to me?
CRAIG: I don't know, I think I passed out or something. I don't remember.
UNCLE ELROY: Passed out? Can't hang, huh? Boy, I knew you was a lightweight. Passed out on one funky ass blunt. They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
SUGA: Mr. Nasty time?
UNCLE ELROY: Mr. Nasty time. But take it easy on me, girl.
SUGA: Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
