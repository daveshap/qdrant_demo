CHRIS: Hello?
KNOX: Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
CHRIS: Knox. Oh yes, Knox. I'm glad you called.
KNOX: You are? She's glad I called!
KNOX: Well, sure!
CHRIS: Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet. But you can bring someone if you like.
KNOX: I'll be there. The Danburrys. Friday night. Thank you, Chris.
KNOX: Can you believe it? She was gonna call me! She invited me to a party with her!
CHARLIE: At Chet Danburry's house.
KNOX: Yeah.
CHARLIE: Well?
KNOX: So?
CHARLIE: So you really think she means you're going with her?
KNOX: Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point. That's not the point at all!
CHARLIE: What is the point?
KNOX: The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me. Damn it, it's gonna happen! I feel it. She's going to be mine!
