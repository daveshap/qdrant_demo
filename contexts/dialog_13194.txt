TERRI: Uh ... Hi! Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
JOEY: Joey. Yeah, who is this?
TERRI: You like ... left me a card? At the club?
JOEY: Right. Right!
TERRI: Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
JOEY: I want to talk to you. We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.
TERRI: Oh yeah. Yeah. Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right? I'll trade you. You give me couch-space. I'll give you talk. OK?
JOEY: Yeah. Sure. You mean ... tonight?
TERRI: Of course tonight. Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
JOEY: No. No. It's fine. Come now. I was having bad dreams anyway.
