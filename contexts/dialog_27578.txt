UNCLE LOUIS: Good. That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
JACQUES: Well... here.
UNCLE LOUIS: In my apartment?
JACQUES: It's my apartment.
UNCLE LOUIS: Liar! Thief! Torturer! When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
JACQUES: Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
UNCLE LOUIS: I'm going to put a lock on the telephone. Did you bring the cassettes?
