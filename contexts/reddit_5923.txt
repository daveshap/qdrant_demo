Simple yet highly marketable degrees?
I’m Journalism grad, fresh outta college, working my first ever job in advertising. The pay isn’t bad but I’d like to work in a specialised field; one where I cannot be replaced by high schoolers willing to work for peanuts.

Since I have no student debt, I’d like to go back to college and specialise in something that’s marketable yet easy to learn. Maybe Finance or something IT related. 

What do you folks suggest?
