Multiplicity of statistical weight of macrostates when combining systems in thermodynamics (Boltzmann entropy) In my lecture notes, the Boltzmann entropy form was motivated as a valid form for entropy partly because it was extensive. However this hinges on the assumption that the statistical weight for a macrostate of two systems combined is their product. Why is this valid- for large systems at least- and when might it break down?
