TERRY: Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
EDIE: Look out for number one. Always number one. I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you. No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
TERRY: Don't say that, Edie, don't...
EDIE: It's true.
TERRY: I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
EDIE: Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
