CASSIUS: That's what I thought!
ADRIAN: Could you concentrate for five seconds?
CASSIUS: I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
ADRIAN: What do you think about... Earth?
ADRIAN: We could create our own hell there.
CASSIUS: You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
ADRIAN: Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
CASSIUS: ...their damned souls will be ours.
ADRIAN: It's our time, brother.
