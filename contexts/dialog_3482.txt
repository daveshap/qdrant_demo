JENNY: You must be Edward Bloom.
EDWARD: How did you know?
JENNY: No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
EDWARD: Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
JENNY: So I've heard.
EDWARD: I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
