Showing \"Return Completed\" as status but didn't receive refund yet I have ordered an IPhone and the phone was not delivered(not sure about the reason) and was returned back to apple warehouse. The status in the order page shows as \"Return Completed\" on 22nd of December 2018. I didn't receive the refund yet. How much longer it might take for the refund to be completed.
