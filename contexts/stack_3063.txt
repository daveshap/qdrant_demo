How can gravitational waves from such a long distance affect the beam of light? Even if it does affect it should affect all the surrounding object making it impossible to detect any change. It would be like keeping a man and a scale in a room, and if a gravitational wave is passed through them in a uniform pattern, the man would see no change in the scale as both shrink and expand at the same time.
