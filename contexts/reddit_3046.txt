How do you look for a good team culture?
I'm a programmer.

I've had various programming jobs that paid from about $50k to about $130k.

Money is not very important for me. It's usually already sufficiently high.

I find the team culture to be more important:

* Are the coworkers friendly?
* Is the manager/lead easy going, sharing fun stories?
* Do you have to be on a call with angry clients?

Usually I ace the interviews with my experience, but I don't get a good perspective on what the team culture is like.

I learn about it quite quickly after a few days of working there, and interacting with everyone.

I've gotten very lucky, and very unlucky. (Currently going through the very unlucky phase unfortunately, and looking for a way out.)

Anyone have experience finding out how the team culture, before you started the job? How do you look for such a thing?
