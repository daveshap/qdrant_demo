RENATA: What does he want from you?
JAMES: Hard to say.
RENATA: I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
JAMES: No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
CATHERINE: They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
JAMES: Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
CATHERINE: You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
JAMES: At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
CATHERINE: I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
