Depression....My coping mechanisims
## 49 yo Male.......These are the top 10 things that have helped me cope with depression for the last 15 years. Just thought i'd share them with you

1. Sleep: Go to Bed before 10pm. Get 6-8 hours solid sleep if you can.
2. Exercise: Walking, Cycling, Swimming. If you can, do them all and as often as you can. Forget Gyms, get out in the Fresh Air. Get back to Nature.
3. Medication: Find the correct AD dosage and stay on it until your doctor says otherwise. No shame in taking medication.
4. Meditation: Buy some good tapes and learn meditation and mindfullness. Practice daily. I takes a while to get use to it so be patient.
5. Reduce External Stressors: This is a hard one but if your job is way too stressful, change it or leave it. Not easy i know but without your health, you've got nothing.
6. Stop living in the past: If you've made mistakes in the past which contribute to your condition, let them go. You will never be able to change what has already gone. Forgive yourself, learn from those mistakes and perceived failures and move on. Just try not to repeat any of them going forward.
7. Kick bad habits: If you take drugs, smoke or drink alcohol, stop now. These are non-negotiable for someone who suffers from depression.
8. Loneliness: This is by far the most difficult to address and is a huge problem in modern society. All i can say is if you have family and friends nearby, meet and talk with them often. They saved my life. If you can't do this and you feel like shit, at least try and ring a local help line.
9. Keep yourself clean and tidy: Wash each day and put on some clean clothes. It'll make you feel better.
10. Remembering 1) - 9)

Remember, you are special and unique. There is only ever going to be one of you....ever.

You can beat this.
