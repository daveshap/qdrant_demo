WALTER: Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
DUDE: Huh?
WALTER: The man is a sex offender. With a record. Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
DUDE: Huh.
WALTER: When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast.
DONNY: What's a pederast, Walter?
WALTER: Shut the fuck up, Donny.
WALTER: Anyway. How much they offer you?
DUDE: Twenty grand. And of course I still keep the rug.
WALTER: Just for making the hand-off?
DUDE: Yeah.
DUDE: ...They gave Dude a beeper, so whenever these guys call--
WALTER: What if it's during a game?
DUDE: I told him if it was during league play--
DONNY: If what's during league play?
WALTER: Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
DONNY: What's wrong with Walter, Dude?
DUDE: I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless. I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
WALTER: Huh?
DONNY: What do you mean, Dude?
DUDE: Rug-peers did not do this. I mean look at it. Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough. She owes money all over town--
WALTER: That...fucking...bitch!
DUDE: It's all a goddamn fake. Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit. And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
DONNY: I am the Walrus.
WALTER: That fucking bitch!
DUDE: Yeah.
DONNY: I am the Walrus.
WALTER: Shut the fuck up, Donny! V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
DONNY: What the fuck is he talking about?
WALTER: That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude! That makes me fucking SICK!
DUDE: Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
DONNY: Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
WALTER: Those rich fucks! This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
DUDE: I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
WALTER: Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
DUDE: Walter, face it, there isn't any connection. It's your roll.
WALTER: Have it your way. The point is--
DUDE: It's your roll--
WALTER: The fucking point is--
DUDE: It's your roll.
