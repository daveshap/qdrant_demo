JUD: Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
LOUIS: Yes.
JUD: Why, then, things should be fine.
LOUIS: A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
JUD: She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
JUD: A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
LOUIS: What?
JUD: Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong.
