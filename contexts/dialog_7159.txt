NANCE: One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office. You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?' So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break. Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
DAVE: Really?
NANCE: My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
