MA STONE: What's ailing that dog?
JABEZ: I dunno.
MA STONE: Well ... make him keep quiet.
JABEZ: And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good. Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him... ... up there, just what I think.
MA STONE: Hush up such talk, Jabez!
JABEZ: I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
JABEZ: Mary--
MARY: Jabez ...
JABEZ: Mary -- how do you feel?
MA STONE: Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
MARY: Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
JABEZ: I'll get the doctor.
MARY: No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
