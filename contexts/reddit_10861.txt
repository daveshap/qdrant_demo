Cancer is back and I'm done.
Well I'm screwed. I'm out of meds to try for it and they cant operate because I did radiation. So now I'm doing shots at 5 am trying to forget today happened. I knew it was going to happen because everything was going so well. I told myself I'd never drink again and well that went right out the window. So now I'm here being the usual failure I am. I dont even think I'm gonna make it to my 21st birthday. That was one of my only goals and now I'm not even gonna be able to do that. And with this stupid virus I cant travel like I wanted to. So I'm 0 for 2. Sorry for the rambling but I feel broken and I cant put it together. GoodnightðŸ’™

Edit: I'm gonna pass out but thanks for the thoughts. I dont think God gonna heal me at the fact that this is relapse 4, but it's the thought that countsðŸ’™
