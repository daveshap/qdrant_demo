JOE: This universe?
PARRISH: Any universe that exists or ever existed. You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are. And you're all fucked up.
JOE: I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
PARRISH: And I don't give a shit.

PARRISH: Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
JOE: I told you, 'watch it'.
