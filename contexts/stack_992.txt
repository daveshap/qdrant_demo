Burning DVD's on Ubuntu (NOT ISO-files) I have a load of self-compiled video dvd's made on Cyberlink PowerDirector which I used to burn to dvd's through Ashampoo Burning Studio 16. These are NOT images of DVD (ie. ISO-files) but instead VIDEO_TS folders with .BUP, .IFO and .VOB -files.They include custom-made menus, music etc.Neither programme I used to use (and paid licenses for) sadly seems to work through WINE programmes (tried Crossover and some others). Thus I have already given up of creating more dvd's (for now), but would dearly love to burn the ones I created earlier. Is there any dvd burner for Ubuntu which handles VIDEO_TS floders instead of ISO images? I have no clue how I would create ISOs...
