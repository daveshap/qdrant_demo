VIRGIL: Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
FLOYD: Naw, he ain't home right now.
VIRGIL: Do you live here?
FLOYD: Yeah, I live here.
VIRGIL: Sorta room-mates?
FLOYD: Exactly room-mates.
VIRGIL: Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
FLOYD: Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
VIRGIL: How do you know? You been there?
FLOYD: No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
VIRGIL: You're right. It is.
