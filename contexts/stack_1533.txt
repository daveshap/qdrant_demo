Convert a toggle switch into a momentary response I'm working on a project and I need to use a toggle switch to control a device that expects a momentary signal.What I want is send a momentary pulse when turning it on and off. Ie: swith off to on: positive pulse, switch on to off: positive pulse again.I've got do this with a small arduino-like board but I'm looking for a pure hardware alternative.My knowledge of electronics are quite small. I thought about using an inverter (NOT gate) to detect both latches (low and high) in the toggle switch plus a few more components, but I'm not sure how to design it.Any ideas?Thank you!
