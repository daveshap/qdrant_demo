SUPPLY SERGEANT: Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
MILLER: White-walls?
SUPPLY SERGEANT: No white-walls, sir, there's a war on. NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE! I can't help you, sir.
MILLER: A half-track, anything.
SUPPLY SERGEANT: Sorry, sir. Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen. How come you guys aren't going?
MILLER: How about that jeep?
SUPPLY SERGEANT: That's General Gavin's. His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
