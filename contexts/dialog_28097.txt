WAITRESS: Evening. Table for one?
LOMBARD: No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
WAITRESS: Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
LOMBARD: Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
WAITRESS: No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
LOMBARD: Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
WAITRESS: I’m sorry...
LOMBARD: Yes. You wouldn’t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
PHIL: Welcome to the club.
LOMBARD: Excuse me?
PHIL: I hear you’re looking for Leon. That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
LOMBARD: Uh-huh.
PHIL: No shit... Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you.
LOMBARD: I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
PHIL: Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge. You don’t know Leon, do you?
LOMBARD: I know his work better than I know him.
PHIL: Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just ain’t worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of ‘em.
LOMBARD: What about his girlfriend?
PHIL: What about which girlfriend?
LOMBARD: Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
PHIL: Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
LOMBARD: Would you know where I might reach her?
PHIL: Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I don’t really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. That’s how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...
LOMBARD: Could that be Camden Market?
PHIL: Yeah. Why? You’re going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
LOMBARD: Fucked-up fucking weird.
