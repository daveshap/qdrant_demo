DULANEY: She's right, Paley. You've got to kill me. She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her. You supplied the Coke. You're an accessory to murder.
REBECCA: Shoot him.
DULANEY: Don't you see what she's doing? She needs you to kill me. She's planned it that way from the start. That's why she phoned me tonight.
DR. PALEY: You called him?
REBECCA: No -- he's lying.
DULANEY: How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me. After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in. That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
REBECCA: Don't listen to him. Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me.
