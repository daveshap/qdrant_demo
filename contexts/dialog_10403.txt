EUGENE: Where are we going?
JEROME: I'm sorry. I've got plans.
EUGENE: Again?
JEROME: She's already got her doubts. I have to act like nothing's wrong.
EUGENE: I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
EUGENE: Where are you taking her?
JEROME: Michael's.
JEROME: Everybody goes there.
EUGENE: You may as well invite her here.
JEROME: Will you be okay?
EUGENE: Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
JEROME: We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
EUGENE: How long?
JEROME: By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, How are you?" Forty-five minutes later I reply
EUGENE: I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
IRENE: What <i>is</i> this place?
JEROME: You've never been here? Let me order for you.
