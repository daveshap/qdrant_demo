ESPERANZA: I waited up till midnight.
RAMÓN: You weren't waiting for me.
ESPERANZA: That meeting only lasted ten minutes. The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
RAMÓN: Be still ...
ESPERANZA: But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
ESPERANZA: Tell me.
RAMÓN: We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
ESPERANZA: No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
