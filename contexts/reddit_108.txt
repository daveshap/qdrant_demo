I need some advice about a friendship

Advice

I  became friends with someone about 6 months ago and I thought everything has been going fine. We have shared some really personal stuff. But for the past couple of weeks I’ve started to notice something. I’m the one that always swipes up first on snap if he posts about something that he’s hurt about and etc, but never swipes up if I posted something I was hurt about. If we are on break from school, we could go 3 weeks without texting each other. He’s also very popular and has very close friends (like they have been friends since 3rd grade and are bonded through Christ) and I’ve been thinking that he’s using me for emotional support because I don’t know of any other reason that he would want to be friends me (just for the record, I’m a really good person and all). What should I do? I hope it doesn’t seem like I’m crazy or anything lol. Another thing, I honestly don’t know if he even cares about me, but I feel like I care more about him. I don’t want to waste my time on someone that doesn’t care about me.
