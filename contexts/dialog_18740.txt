EVELYN: I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
O'CONNELL: No you're not.
EVELYN: I'm not?
O'CONNELL: Not unless you call me Rick.
EVELYN: Why would I do that?
O'CONNELL: Because that's my name.
EVELYN: I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
JONATHAN: Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
EVELYN: Well neither do I, thank you.
