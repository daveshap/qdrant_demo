Multiple interviews but no offers... are you always the problem?
I've been on 6 interviews since I was let go from my social media position at a mid-level cosmetics brand in April. Not my fault at all, but that's another story. I've been told I interview very well. I research the company, bring a portfolio of work, use the STAR method, etc. and people really seem to like me... yet I have no offers. When you have multiple interviews but no offers, are you always the problem?

It is worth noting that I live in a very competitive market (Los Angeles) in a very competitive field (social media/copywriting). Most of my interviews have been with very high-profile companies. Two household name beauty brands, a marketing agency working with some of the top shows on TV, a huge TV corporation, a nationwide hair salon, etc. These positions probably have hundreds of qualified applicants, so I'm trying not to let it get me down... but it's hard. Am I definitely the problem, or are there situations where it's just a matter of luck?
