My fish died.
This sucks. I wasn't the most loving fish owner, but it was part of daily routine, feeding him (a beta named Pez) twice a day. I'm not telling my friends because I bet they'd just say it was my own fault for not cleaning the tank often enough. And I just don't want to deal with that. So yeah. Rest in peace Pez. I miss you. 

Edit: In case anyone was curious: his name was Pez because it's Spanish for 'fish'
