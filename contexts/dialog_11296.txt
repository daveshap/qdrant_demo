HENRY: Stop! Stop!
KAREN: Let her carry this shit inside.
KAREN: Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke. I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
HENRY: It'll be okay.
KAREN: He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
HENRY: We've got to help each other.
KAREN: Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
HENRY: It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody. Forget Paulie. As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
KAREN: I can't do it anymore.
HENRY: Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
KAREN: I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
HENRY: Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
KAREN: I don't want to hear about her anymore.
HENRY: Never.
HENRY: Get packed. We're getting out of here.
KAREN: With what?
HENRY: Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
KAREN: But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
HENRY: Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
VARIO: I don't want any more of that Shit.
HENRY: Wha? Me?
VARIO: Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
HENRY: Me? Why would I get into that shit?
VARIO: I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
HENRY: Why would I get into that?
