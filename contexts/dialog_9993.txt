CHARNIER: Did you pick up the car?
DEVEREAUX: It is waiting for you in the garage.
CHARNIER: Did they follow you?
DEVEREAUX: I wasn't looking.
CHARNIER: Henri... I need one more favor from you. I know I am imposing...
DEVEREAUX: My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
CHARNIER: Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not. The police know you brought the car into the country. This makes you an accomplice.
