What are the short, medium, long term stated goals of the Fed's recently announced "Main Street Business Lending Program"?
The Fed recently announced what people are calling an "unprecedented" and "aggressive" program to help the economy.

Under the new programs, the Fed will lend against student loans, credit card loans, and U.S. government backed-loans to small businesses, and buy bonds of larger employers and make loans to them in what amounts to four years of bridge financing.

I would like a better understanding of the short (1 month), medium (6-12 month), and long term (1 year and beyond) goals and expected impacts. Has the Fed enacted similar programs in the past? If so, what were their short, medium and long term impacts?
