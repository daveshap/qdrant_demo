Methods for feature elimination of categorical variables? I have a dataset with 56 columns, 4 numeric and the target variable which is also numeric. I am trying to eliminate some of the categorical variables from my model and wanted to get some understanding of the methodologies to do that.I am currently working in R, which is somewhat new to me.Any help would be great!Edit: I would like to eliminate some variables to increase my models performance. While the model is not performing poorly, I believe the model can perform better than it is now. Some of the variables I can take a look at and know right off the bat that this is something that I can remove. But, I would like to show proof that this is not an informative predictors.Edit2: Here is information about my dataset.Out of the columns that are categorical, there are roughly 5 variables that have levels greater than 2. My goal is essentially to remove variables that are the least informative to my model. My model is a regression model to predict the sale price of something. Using accuracy as a metric, I want to have the most accurate model and remove predictors (both numeric and categorical) that are not conducive to the predicting accuracy of my model.In removing categorical variables, I would be removing the entire variable, not particular levels.
