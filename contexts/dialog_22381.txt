SAM: It was at that.
VINCENT: A lot of people died.
SAM: I've seen a lot of people die before.
VINCENT: I haven't. Not like that. How do you get used to it?
SAM: You don't. You just learn to live with it.
VINCENT: I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
SAM: We live in a singular world, my friend.
VINCENT: I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth. I'm a hood, a thief. Big time in a small time king of way. To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend. But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
SAM: You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
