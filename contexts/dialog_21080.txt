STEW: I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
GALLAGHER: Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
STEW: No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before. It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
GALLAGHER: Yes.
BINGY: Hello, there, Meadows![13]
SMYTHE: Who is it you wish to see, sir?
BINGY: I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
SMYTHE: Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
BINGY: Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy who loves parties. You know—
BINGY: —a beautiful pair of shoulders! But listen now, as a favor, will you please make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him because if you don't my whole family's going to die.
SMYTHE: I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
BINGY: Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
