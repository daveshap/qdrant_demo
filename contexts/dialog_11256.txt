SWAY: So, you seeing anybody?
MEMPHIS: No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
SWAY: She was so great, why'd you leave her?
MEMPHIS: Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
DONNY ASTRICKY: What's the matter?
FREB: It's all microchips and shit ...
DONNY ASTRICKY: Yeah?
