CRUZ: Ironic, isn't it?
KAREN: How are you, Raymond?
CRUZ: Freezing. But I'm getting warmer.
KAREN: Quite a mess.
CRUZ: Yeah. And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
KAREN: Who?
CRUZ: Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
KAREN: What is it with crack and transsexuals?
CRUZ: Yeah, Eddie was a real character. Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
KAREN: Yeah. I saw one of 'em outside.
CRUZ: Yonelle. Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window. Fuckin' animals.
