How do I come out to my parents that I’m having problems? (read the post)
So like, I’m in a spot of trouble. 
Background I’m 14 biological male. 

For like maybe 5 ish years, I’ve been thinking if my life would be better as a female. I personally HATE with almost all of my being the male human race. I can abide being male. I haven’t started anything in terms of the process to go trans; I haven’t even told anyone. 

I can’t decide if I want to be trans (FTM), and if i do decide, how should I come out? Is it wise to do so now at 14; am I too late?

I need advice because I can’t keep living how I am now.
