Clubs and Nightlife
Hi, I'm Jane and I'm 19. I moved out of my parents house for college last year. Currently I am studying and living in quite a big city. 
So, I join my friends to go to bars and clubs lately. I was wondering is there any hack or safety tips I could use when something happen or for me to use for my safety. I usually went to clubs with my guy and girl friends that I really trust. Fortunately, so far nothing happen. All is fine. 
I usually went to a club where there is a lot of foreign people and students.
Can you guys please share your tips or experiences during your nightlife? I would like to know and probably learn something new from you guys! ;D
Thanks
