How to go about contacting employers after a hiring freeze?
I was laid off at the very beginning of March, about a week before everything officially shut down. I was very lucky and snuck in about 5 interviews right before our governor called for an immediate closure of the types of businesses (hospitality) I was interviewing at. One of these positions was particularly attractive to me, and I never heard back. This is understandable since I was told the day of the interview “Well get back to you by next week” and by next week they were forced to close. 

I recently received a marketing email from that company that they will be reopening in the beginning of June. I wouldn’t be surprised if the position was cancelled, but was wondering if now would be a good time to reach out to the interviewer on the status of the position. Would this be professional and if so what’s the best way to go about it?
