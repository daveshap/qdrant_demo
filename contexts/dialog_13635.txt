INDIANA: Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
WILLIE: What?!
INDIANA: Can you move your arm?
WILLIE: Just one arm!
INDIANA: Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
WILLIE: PET IT??!!
INDIANA: Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
WILLIE: THE WHAT?!
INDIANA: Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!
WILLIE: Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
INDIANA: Keep stroking it!
INDIANA: What's happening?
WILLIE: It's starting to let go!
INDIANA: That's good -- you're doing fine.
