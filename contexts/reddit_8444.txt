How can undocumented immigrants be subject to criminal proceedings for crossing the border, which is a civil offense?
In several articles such as this one: [http://thehill.com/latino/394782-protests-against-trump-immigration-policy-expected-nationwide](http://thehill.com/latino/394782-protests-against-trump-immigration-policy-expected-nationwide)

There are several references to "criminal prosecution" for border crossing.  But illegal entry (or improper entry) into an US border carries a civil  penalty. The amount is at least $50 and not more than $250 or twice that  amount, if the person has been previously fined with a civil penalty  for the same violation. (See 8 U.S.C. Section 1325, I.N.A. Section 275.)
