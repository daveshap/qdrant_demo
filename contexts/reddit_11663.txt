Feeling like the ugly sister
my sister has always been the attractive one. I had to be the ugly one with the nasty genes. No man will ever want me. I have this nasty fat nose and bad eyelashes. I also have these nasty ass fat genes. I'm tired of people lying to me saying that I'm thick when I'm just fat. I've Always been shorter and uglier than my sister. Even my youngest preteen sister said my sister was cuter. And the attractive sister said that she was the one with the looks while I just had the hair. My brother always treats her better including his friends. Even my family treats her better. My cousin's are more nicer to her and they treat me like shit.That coo all over her while they including my brother said I was nasty and discussing. People always tell her she's pretty while I've never been told that. I hate that I was born like this. I'm just disgusting.
