MR. ALEXANDER: I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
ALEX: Thank you, sir.
MR. ALEXANDER: My wife... Alex freezes.
MR. ALEXANDER: ... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
ALEX: Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
MR. ALEXANDER: No. She's dead!
ALEX: I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
MR. ALEXANDER: She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
MR. ALEXANDER: And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
ALEX: Phoned some friends, sir?
MR. ALEXANDER: Yes. They want to help.
ALEX: Help me, sir?
MR. ALEXANDER: Help you.
ALEX: Who are they, sir?
MR. ALEXANDER: They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
MR. ALEXANDER: Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
ALEX: Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
MR. ALEXANDER: No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
