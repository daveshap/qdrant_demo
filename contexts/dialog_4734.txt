ROBERT: If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
CRAIG: Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
ROBERT: The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
CRAIG: That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
CRAIG: Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
WALLACE: You've all sworn to Longshanks.
CRAIG: An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
WALLACE: So let the council swear publicly.
CRAIG: We cannot. Some scarcely believe you are alive. Other think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. We bid you to Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, two days from now, at sunset. Pledge us your pardon and we will unite behind you. Scotland will be one.
WALLACE: I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
CRAIG: He has already agreed to come.
HAMISH: You know it's a trap.
WALLACE: Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
HAMISH: I don't want to be a martyr.
WALLACE: Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
HAMISH: That's just a dream, William!
WALLACE: We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
HAMISH: Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
WALLACE: My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
HAMISH: Keep these. We're going too.
WALLACE: No. One of us is enough.
CRAIG: He won't come.
ROBERT: He will. I know he will.
