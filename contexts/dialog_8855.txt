KARRAS: No it's alright I'll take it straight.
CHRIS: Are you sure?
KARRAS: It's fine really, sit.
KARRAS: Where's Regan's father?
CHRIS: In Europe.
KARRAS: Have you told him what's happening?
CHRIS: No
KARRAS: Well I think you should.
KARRAS: I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
CHRIS: What's the difference?
KARRAS: Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't help support a case for possession.
CHRIS: She...killed Burke Dennings.
KARRAS: What?
CHRIS: She killed Burke Dennings. She pushed him out of the window.
