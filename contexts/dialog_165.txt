NICOLETTE: Hey, honey.
EDDIE: Hey.
NICOLETTE: What is your problem? Why'd you snap at me? I just wanted a statement.
EDDIE: I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
NICOLETTE: You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues. You could give me something.
EDDIE: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I embarrass you, sweetheart? Oh...
NICOLETTE: Stop it.
EDDIE: Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
NICOLETTE: Alright, alright, Eddie. Don't patronize me.
EDDIE: I'm not.
NICOLETTE: Yes you are. I'm not just some reporter. I don't just stick a microphone in your face. You could give me something.
EDDIE: Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence. That was...
NICOLETTE: That was good. You were holding the evidence.
EDDIE: You were merciless. You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
NICOLETTE: Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh?
EDDIE: You're ruthless.
NICOLETTE: You're not so bad yourself.
