EDDIE: Dowd. Eddie Dowd.
ESPARZA: If you'd had the sense to ask for my help, I might've helped you. But you've probably scared Chuckie Roeder off for good, I have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way. Now.
EDDIE: Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
ROGER: 1530 Rivington Street.
EDDIE: -- What?
ROGER: Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
EDDIE: You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex. Nice.
