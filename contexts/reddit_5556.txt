How does one get a job at Costcos’ Tire Center?
I love being a Tire and Oil change Technician, what I would love to do is to become apart of Costcos’ tire center.

My question is how do you get a job at Costco and what does it take to get employed there?

I already sent my application in but no response.

I have experience as an auto technician, I just need to get my foot in the door, how do I do this?
