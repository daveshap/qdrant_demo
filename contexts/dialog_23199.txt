MILLS: I'm a little thrown. I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
SOMERSET: Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile. After that, we'll...
MILLS: Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p. Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
MILLS: I need to start getting the feel of it all, right? Meet the people.
SOMERSET: I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone. I can't help wondering... why here?
MILLS: I... I don't follow.
SOMERSET: All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
MILLS: I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess. Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
SOMERSET: You just met me.
MILLS: Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
SOMERSET: It's very simple. You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it. I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
MILLS: Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there. I don't know. Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls. But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
SOMERSET: Let me tell you how I want this to go. I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
MILLS: I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell. I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
SOMERSET: Not here.
MILLS: I realize that.
SOMERSET: Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
