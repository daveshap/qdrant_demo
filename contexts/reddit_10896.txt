Wife cheated
Using a throwaway acc cause friends know my main 

So my wife cheated on me, after 6 years of marriage I found out she was cheating for 4 of those years so that's amazing isn't it? 

I remember when I was younger I used to tell my mum that if I was ever cheated on I would probably kill myself, I see now it was a fucked up thing to say to my own mum but it's irony isn't it. 

How it's all came back to bite my arse. I guess I'm just typing this to get my last few words out tbh, I guess I kinda predicted what would happen to me. 

In all honestly I don't know what to do, what to say or even how to feel. The thing that hurts the most is my wife knew about all my depression and how when I was younger I was suicidal but of course never went through with it as I believed that there was light at the end of that tunnel. 

But look now, I guess what tunnel collapsed. Holy fuck I'm just so depressed and broken.

I'm not looking for attention, I just want someone to read my last few words. Strange isn't it, how strangers can care more for you than those close to you. 

Goodbye
