Are lobbyists and diplomats who stay at Trump properties to positively influence him engaged in bribery?
The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/2016/11/18/9da9c572-ad18-11e6-977a-1030f822fc35_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_trumphotel-915pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory) had a story today with interviews with several foreign diplomats who indicated that they or others would likely deliberately stay at the Trump-branded and operated Old Post Office Hotel in Washington DC.

>In interviews with a dozen diplomats, many of whom declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak about anything related to the next U.S. president, some said spending money at Trump’s hotel is an easy, friendly gesture to the new president.

>“Why wouldn’t I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, ‘I love your new hotel!’ Isn’t it rude to come to his city and say, ‘I am staying at your competitor?’ ” said one Asian diplomat.

Under federal law, bribery is described (in relevant part) as follows:

>Whoever directly or indirectly, corruptly gives, offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official, or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity, with intent:

>>(A) to influence any official act; or

>>(B) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing, or collude in, or allow, any fraud, or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud, on the United States; or

>>(C) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person;

>...shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.

So my question is: is the conduct described by the Washington Post bribery?  Does it require that Trump actually take an official action, or does the mere fact of giving Trump money + requesting official action on your behalf suffice?
