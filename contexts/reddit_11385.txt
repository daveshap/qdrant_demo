I am far more unhappy then I should be.
I understand that my life is pretty good by most metrics. I get accepted to my goal medical school last year, I graduated a semester early, I’m not ugly and I have a decent body. I have a good amount of friends that I hang out with multiple times a week. However, I don’t feel excited about anything anymore. I realized this about a week ago. All the things I usually loved doing like reading, playing music and playing video games are now boring so I just sleep and scroll on my phone in my bed. My parents are basically immigrants who lived much harder lives than I could ever imagine so they can’t understand why I am unhappy, when I can’t even explain why myself. Now that the semester is starting for my friends and I’m home, I feel even worse. I used to be the funny kid in class that always had a smile on his face and making others laugh during tough times, but now I can’t even go an entire day without being extremely pessimistic. When I try to talk about this to someone I feel pathetic because my life is good compared to others. Even accomplishing goals don’t give me any sense of satisfaction or accomplishment. When I got into med school I wasn’t even happy. Just meh. I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Hopefully someone here can give me some perspective and help me find some meaning in this meaningless life.
