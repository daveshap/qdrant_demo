To what extent is the Alt-Right based in racism and white supremacy, and how connected are Trump and Bannon to the group?
Everything that I have ever seen online seems to suggest that the movement is, at it's core, motivated by white supremacy, ethano-nationalism, and identity politics. This can be found on the [ADL website](http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/alt-right-a-primer-about-the.html#.WC5jdXfMwyk) and various alt-right message boards and websites (/r/altright, [dailystormer](http://www.dailystormer.com/breitbarts-alt-right-analysis-is-the-product-of-a-degenerate-homosexual-and-an-ethnic-mongrel/)...etc). 

However, some who identify with the alt-right claim that the racists are only a small minority of the group who are simply trying to hijack the movement. See: [Breitbart](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/)

Due to ties with the alt-right, Donald Trump's appointment of Steve Bannon (of Breitbart News) to the position of Chief Strategist has drawn significant [ire from the left](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-statement-on-steve-bannon), and [praise from white nationalist groups](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/11/14/white-nationalists-rejoice-trumps-appointment-breitbarts-stephen-bannon).   

What ties do Bannon, and now by association, Trump, have to Alt-Right groups? Is the concern over the appointment from the left and minority groups justified?
