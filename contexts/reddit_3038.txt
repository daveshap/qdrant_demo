Is happiness important for a job?
I am an accounting graduate, worked in an accounting firm for about a year. I have a strong urge to quit because of the toxic environment. All seniors there would constantly pile work on the juniors with minimal guidance while they are able to leave work early. Any correspondence with clients is done via juniors as well. The seniors would always hide behind the juniors in case anything wrong happens with the decisions they made. My senior in particular does not treat me with respect or professionally and would always talk to me with sarcasm. An example of a situation would be when I asked her for guidance for consolidating accounts. Her response was, "Wow i cant believe you dont know this" and proceeded to ignore me. 

I have friends and family that asked me to leave to find a happier place as they noticed that i was really demotivated. My colleagues on the other hand asked me persevere and stay. 

Is happiness important to a job? Should I continue or resign?

PS: the turnover here is high. We would have 2-3 resignees every month.
