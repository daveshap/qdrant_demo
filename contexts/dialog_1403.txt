RAINS: Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
PINKERTON: Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
PARKER: Your men knew the risks.
RAINS: What is going on here, man?
PINKERTON: My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
PARKER: They had to be dealt with!
PINKERTON: By burning down their homes?
RAINS: You wouldn't have done that?
PINKERTON: Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
RAINS: I want them arrested and hanged!
PINKERTON: Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
RAINS: This is no game.
PINKERTON: I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
RAINS: A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis
PINKERTON: It is a nice piece of writing.
RAINS: The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction
PINKERTON: Oh, that's the best part.
