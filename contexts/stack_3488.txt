Exchange of public keys with DHE-RSA The paper \"Imperfect Forward Secrecy: How Diffie-Hellman Fails in Practice\" by Adrian et al claims that the NSA might be able to eavesdrop on a large percentage of TLS connections, because they managed to crack certain Diffie-Hellman groups.Now, I assume a situation where a client is connected to a server via DHE-RSA. What I don't understand is why, in this situation, cracking Diffie-Hellman alone would be enough to eavesdrop. Wouldn't it be necessary for the NSA to also get ahold of the private RSA key of the server? Put in different words: When the client sends his DH public key to the server, doesn't he encrypt his DH public key with the RSA public key of the server? (If not, why not?)
