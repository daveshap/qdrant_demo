FAITH: It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
KATE: But it's July.

KATE: What about your job?
FAITH: I have vacation time coming to me.
KATE: You don't have a passport.

FAITH: Would you stop saying that? I need you to do me a really big favor.
KATE: Does Dwayne know about this?
FAITH: Of course not. I told him I was going to visit a great aunt. And don't tell Larry, either.
