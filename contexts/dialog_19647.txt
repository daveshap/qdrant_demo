LEON: Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
IRANOFF: Get out of here!
LEON: Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
KOPALSKI: We may have a chance.
LEON: Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
KOPALSKI: We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
LEON: All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
IRANOFF: That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
KOPALSKI: Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
BULJANOFF: You think because you represent the former Duchess...
LEON: The Duchess...
BULJANOFF: The former Duchess!
LEON: In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
IRANOFF: All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
LEON: But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
IRANOFF: I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
LEON: Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
BULJANOFF: Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
LEON: Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
IRANOFF: What proposition?
LEON: I just said let's have a little lunch. Room service.
