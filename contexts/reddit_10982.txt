self isolation made me realize how pathetic and lonely i am
everyone always jokes about being alone or staying home all day and doing nothing, but now that we are actually all in isolation suddenly everyone’s a happy extrovert that misses their friends and school and work and going out etc.. of course i knew this all along, people just say things to be relatable, but it doesn’t help me feel anymore normal about the fact that i am an actual introvert who stays home all day and has no friends or no hobbies or nothing to do at all, and those weren’t ‘jokes’ they were my life. and being in quarantine is no different for me. it’s pathetic really.
