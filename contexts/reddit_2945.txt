What do I do if I'm starting over at 35?
Well, here I am. I’m 35 and without a job and I have no idea what I’m doing. I left my last job due to management issues. I’m trying to decide what to do next. I’ve debated going back to school but I’m worried that after the time and financial commitment I’ll end up hating it and be right back in the same boat only then I’ll be closer to 40.

Any advice on how to find the right fit for me? How can I assess my skills and education to find what jobs I would be qualified for? Should I eat the expense and hire a career counselor? I’m incredibly lost right now and any advice anyone could give me would be greatly appreciated.
