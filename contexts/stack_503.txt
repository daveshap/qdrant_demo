Add persistance on bootable flashdrive from the bootable flashdrive I am currently booted from Ubuntu on a flash drive.However, it doesn't have persistence. Is there a way to give it persistence while booted on it without reinstalling it?I don't have admin on the machine I am booting from, so I can't actually reinstall a version with persistence.I'm using vanilla Ubuntu downloaded from the website yesterday. I installed it with rufus.
