GOOD GUY: Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
HEROINE: Right. Were going to need some fire power. Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
BOSS MAN: I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
BARTENDER: I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
HEROINE: Okay, well that's something.
ROADIE: So we've got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
