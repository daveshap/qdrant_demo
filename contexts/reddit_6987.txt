How to explain getting fired for attendance?
Today I was fired from my job that I've been at for a little over 3 years due to my attendance. They clarified over and over that it had absolutely nothing wrong with my work performance or customer service- just my attendance. Either tardies or call ins. I can admit to that in the last couple of months I have been a bit flaky. I am sad as I loved the workplace I was at. Now I am worried what to write on applications under "reason for leaving" .. do I even put on there terminated or could I just say looking to move on? I need advice on this as I have never been fired before. My manager and I were on good terms, the problem was just my wrongdoing in attendance.

Feeling a bit lost. Thank you all in advance.
