I am currently collecting unemployment benefits after being fired in December. Recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder... what are my next steps, if any?
I am in Florida and I was fired in the beginning of December.  I have been collecting unemployment as I try and find my next job.

In 2011 I was diagnosed with clinical depression. Middle of December after getting multiple second opinions, I was told that I was misdiagnosed and I am actually Bipolar not depressed.  I started treatment immediately and dropped my previous medication for depression.

So my 1st question is.. do I have to do anything with my current unemployment benefits situation? I am pretty sure one of the questions on the application was do you have a disability of some sort and one of the disabilities listed was bipolar. My 2nd question is, can I apply for additional unemployment benefits while I start this treatment (most meds  for bipolar don't start to show effect until 6 weeks.).
