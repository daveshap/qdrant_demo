WALLACE: You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
MARTIN: Give me the bad news.
WALLACE: We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
MARTIN: Anything in it?
WALLACE: Money.
WALLACE: But nowhere near three million dollars worth. I would say maybe twenty thousand.
MARTIN: There was more than that.
WALLACE: Not in the trunk.
MARTIN: That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
WALLACE: Yeah, we did. It was unleaded, high octane.
MARTIN: So...what's the good news?
