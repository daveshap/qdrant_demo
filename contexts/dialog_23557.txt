ALEX: Boy, am I glad to see you.
JULIET: What are you doing here?
ALEX: We have to talk.
JULIET: Your painful groin?
ALEX: Later. But first -- him.
JULIET: David?
ALEX: Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
JULIET: Oh, good.
ALEX: He won't do anything for me, but for you --
JULIET: Forget it.
ALEX: He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
JULIET: And the money?
ALEX: We could put it somewhere.
JULIET: Where he can't get it?
ALEX: Now you thought of that, not me.
JULIET: Forget it -- he'll come down.
ALEX: Expecting anyone?
JULIET: No.
ALEX: Oh.
JULIET: Aren't you going to answer it?
ALEX: Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
