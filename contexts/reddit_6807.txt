Internal recruiter set up last minute phone interviews. Is that normal? Any tips?
I applied to an internal posting about a month ago, and promptly forgot about it.

Today before the end of work day, I get 3 calendar invites from the internal recruiter titled "Phone interview" with the actual hiring manager and 2 others within the team. The calls are 2 days from now. Is that weird or is that how things work now? I haven't had a real interview in a few years so I may be out of touch and I need to prepare myself.

Previously, I've always spoken to the HR recruiter first about the position and times I'm available to speak further. I've never really had an interview just sprung on me like this, so part of me feels like its maybe just a formality before I get rejected. Luckily I'm available and will be able to take all 3 call appointments. 

Are there any tips for internal interviews? I've only done one before as a screening and I wasn't a fit for that role. I feel like I can be good for the new position, but hopefully I'll get more info speaking with the manager.
