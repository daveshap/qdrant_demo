How Important is College?
I really want to do something with fashion.  I'm open to basically anything in the industry.  It's totally my biggest passion and it has been for as long as I can remember.

I'm not sure if anyone here is actually a professional in fashion, but I have a question: exactly how important is a college education in securing a job in the industry?  I'm asking because I don't think I will ever go to college.  There's a valid reason why that I won't share with y'all, but I could go through college if I absolutely needed to.

How bad of an idea is it to skip out on college? Do you know of anyone in the industry without a college degree? Thanks!
