My sister's suicide this week.
I’ve never posted here before, but I thought I’d share my story due to events that happened this week. I am Sophia’s younger brother (I have two older sisters, as well), and I am devastated by her suicide at her accommodation near the university she studied at. This is her Reddit account which she made this month: ([https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanZucchini](https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanZucchini)). I was not aware of how her thoughts had changed since I last met her in September 2018, and it’s unfortunate that I was not given the chance to contact her, as I have autism and depression too. I had no idea that she tried to run away before I contacted her on her birthday this month; she actually responded “Thank you, love you always!”, just two weeks ago from today.

We had our fights and arguments in the past, but we sincerely amended this last year, and we enjoyed our older sister’s wedding together (when we went abroad in August 2018). I genuinely believed she would come home for the Easter holidays in a few weeks, as I accepted that she didn’t want to come home for Christmas due to wanting to excel in her studies. This tragedy has brought the family closer together: I had a heart-to-heart with my father, who I thought didn’t understand my emotions or cared enough about them; I vowed to stop being so shy and reclusive around family; I promised that if I ever felt like this, I would get in-touch immediately; I contacted my old friends from school and have planned to meet them again. I have been taken aback by all the supportive comments I received, even from people I never really spoke to that I assumed didn’t care for me.

She was proud of me, because, last year, on the drive back home from the airport, she told me I had overcome so much, in regard to all my troubles and suicidal behaviour since 2015. I don’t want the same fate as her, because I feel responsible for this world, regardless of how much evil is committed every day, and I want to change it for the better in my life. Aside from the times that we fell-out, I tried to socialise with her, as she usually locked herself in her room and played music. I gave her documents that she requested me to print-out; I asked if she wanted to play Smash Bros. (I tried to teach her how to play, and I remember the time that I had a 300% handicap and still won); I asked if she wanted to get into the same cartoon shows as me (Steven Universe, Invader Zim, Star Vs. The Forces of Evil, etc.). I respected her decision to focus on her studies (I would have done the same), and I thought she would finally be able to spend this time with me during the summer, after finishing her undergraduate degree.

Whenever the funeral service is planned, I intend to sing ‘Love Like You’ (the credits theme from Steven Universe), in-front of all the attendees. She couldn’t get into the show from watching the first five episodes (she thought it was too goofy), but she liked the songs from the show, even from episodes she hadn’t seen before. I remember she was listening to ‘Stronger Than You’ and ‘Dear Old Dad’ whilst studying at home. Thank you for all the memories, and I won’t let you down.

I posted this here, as she posted on this subreddit this month, and I want to help and talk to people who feel this way, because I have felt like this before. I also posted this on Suicide Bereavement.
