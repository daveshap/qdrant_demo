FENNYMAN: Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughterâ€¦Almost finished?
HENSLOWE: Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
HENSLOWE: Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started. You have begun?
WILL: Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
HENSLOWE: No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
WILL: It is all locked safe in here
HENSLOWE: God be praised! Locked?
WILL: As soon as I have found my muse
HENSLOWE: Who is she this time?!
WILL: She is always Aphrodite.
HENSLOWE: Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
WILL: Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
HENSLOWE: Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
WILL: What piece? Richard Crookback?
HENSLOWE: No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
WILL: Who wrote that?
HENSLOWE: Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
WILL: Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
