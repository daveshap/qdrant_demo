Help with bf and low sex drive
I take several medications for depression and anxiety and they have a serious effect on my sex drive.  There are times when it's practically nonexistent, and times when it seems normal.  My problem is my bf.  We've been together almost three years and I've never been happier.

He is amazing.  He's sexy, smart, funny and so sweet and caring.  I love him so much, but I worry.  His sex drive is so much higher than mine and I'm scared that I'm going to lose him.  

He's not the kind of guy who would ever cheat, that's not my worry.  What I worry about is him getting frustrated in the bedroom because of my low sex drive. 

 I guess what im asking is, are there other ppl out there who have this issue?  How did you resolve it?  I enjoy sex, especially with him, I just, I don't know how to approach this.

Edit/update

Had a very long talk with my bf as many of you suggested.  He was super sweet, and supportive, I was in tears of course.  He promises me that he feels like we are fine, and my sex drive isn't an issue for him.  He also said that if I ever felt pressured he was sorry.  So I guess all my worries were for nothing.  

Thank you so much to those who were supportive and offered real advice.
