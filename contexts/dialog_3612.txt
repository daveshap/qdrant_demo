R.L.: Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
LAZARUS: You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
R.L.: I think you did alright by God under the circumstances. Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
LAZARUS: Don't know if God wanna see me.
R.L.: He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
