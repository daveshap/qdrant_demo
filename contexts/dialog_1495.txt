ANDY: Jesus...
MARCEL: How well did, er, do you know him?
ANDY: Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think
MARCEL: No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
ANDY: Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
MARCEL: Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
ANDY: What do you mean, maniacs?
MARCEL: Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
ANDY: Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
MARCEL: Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
ANDY: I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
MARCEL: Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
LEDUC: Here.
MARCEL: Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
ANDY: Yeah. I guess so. Did he say anything? Before the coma?
MARCEL: Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
ANDY: Why would he pick this one?
MARCEL: I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
ANDY: Not that I know.
MARCEL: Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
