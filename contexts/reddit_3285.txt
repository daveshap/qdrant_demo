Does Interior Designer has a future?
I have strong interest in interior design, yet I'm in the dilemma of chosing Business and Interior Design. I've been told that there's no future for Interior Design because many do not renovate their houses with interior designer since there are lots of interior design samples that could be found online.

Is really the a future for interior design?  If there are many things could be replaced by AI and samples could be simply acquire online, what can interior designer do in the future?
