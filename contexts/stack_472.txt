Have a question about dual booting? I just recently purchased a new laptop, a Dell Inspiron 15-3567. It has an core i3 processor, 6 Gb of ram, and 1 Tb hard drive. I wanted to dual boot windows with ubuntu 16.04.3, but have run into some issues.Now, first thing i did was, is I went into the BIOS and went to change the boot sequence, because i was going to run ubuntu from a disk. I changed it to UEFI secure boot off, made sure the legacy boot was off, and then applied changes and restarted. Once I restarted, I went back into the BIOS and I set it to boot from the disk drive. It restarted and then booted into the ubuntu disk. Everything was working fine, I did see however that it said hardware issue, when the disk was first initializing, but it seemed to boot fine and brought up the try free or install ubuntu prompt window. So, I hit install ubuntu and went through the motions, because I was sure it would tell me soon that I already had a os on the machine and what would I like to do. So, when I got to that prompt, it said that ubuntu didnt detect any os and how would i like to proceed. Well, I canceled the install, and then backed out and shutdown the laptop. Once i rebooted, I went back into the BIOS, and changed the settings back, and I still have my windows 10 that came on the laptop; so I'm thoroughly confused on how that happened. Anyone know what Im doing wrong ?
