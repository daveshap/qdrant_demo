MELVIN: Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?

MELVIN: Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire.

Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
SIMON: Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
MELVIN: Okay, then.
