KISSINGER: Exactly, yes, Mr. President. That is my contention.
NIXON: That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
ZIEGLER: But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
NIXON: Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
EHRLICHMAN: Excuse me ... Are you talking about recognizing China, Mr. President? That would cost us our strongest support.
NIXON: No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
