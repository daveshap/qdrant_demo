Question about Major Gifts Officer job
I just discovered this was a position and it's something I think I would very much like to do.

I discovered it while looking at jobs I could apply to with a masters in macro social work, a program to which I'm applying.

Does this seem like a good route? Does anyone have any insight on this sort of position?
