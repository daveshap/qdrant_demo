I can never have a pet until I move out.
It sounds dumb, but I always wanted a real pet. All of the pets I have gotten were all fish, and it gets boring after a while. My mom says "I won't do anything to take care of it." However, I *want* to change that. I say "I'll clean the tank, litter box, whatever, I just want a pet." She then says "I don't like animals, so too bad." There's no point in saying I should take care of it if you'll never get me a pet because of *your* preferences. I sound greedy, I know, but it gets boring having a sister who always wants to pick a fight, a dad who is always working, and a mom who just wants grades out of you.

I have always wanted a cat, a hamster, a rabbit, or even a snake. Something that I can take care of and have fun watching. It could be an experience that can change me for the better. I could gain a sense of responsibility, so I can be responsible when I get older. There are other ways, but taking care of a living thing is the best way to gain responsibility.

I have to wait about 12 years, because if I live with some friends after I graduate college, my mom would fucking kill me. It's something I have to deal with for a while, and I don't even need all of the pets I listed, just one. If I have a good argument, it's no use, because it's always "I don't like animals." She's not allergic or anything, my mom just hates animals. She says, and I quote, "If you get a pet I would just kick it." 

What the actual fuck?! That's cruel, even for her. My mom once laughed in my face for asking for a kitten, which hurt a bit, especially because she decided to tell *everyone in my fucking family*. Everyone in my immediate family laughed, but cousins and everyone didn't really care, so that's okay.

Sorry for the vent, it just bothers me way too much.
