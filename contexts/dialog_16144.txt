ALYSSA: I was wondering.
SAM: You're driving me crazy! Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
ALYSSA: Not really.
SAM: You're off, you know? You're way, way off.
ALYSSA: I thought I was helping you.
SAM: It would help me if I could kiss you.
ALYSSA: No, I don't...NO. I thought we were just friends.
SAM: What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality. I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
ALYSSA: Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
SAM: Okay. I guess.
