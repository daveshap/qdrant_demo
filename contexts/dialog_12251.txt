HAROLD: That wasn't very scary.
MAUDE: No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
HAROLD: Oh, you weren't scared.
MAUDE: Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
HAROLD: Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
HAROLD: How about some candy floss?
MAUDE: Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
HAROLD: You sure have a way with people.
MAUDE: Well, they're my species.
HAROLD: Look at the stars.
MAUDE: Yes. They're old friends.
HAROLD: Do you think there is any life up there?
MAUDE: I don't know. Perhaps.
HAROLD: Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
MAUDE: We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
HAROLD: You should have been a poet.
MAUDE: Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world. What a joke it will be if like them I -
MAUDE: - end where I began.
HAROLD: Maude.
MAUDE: Yes.
HAROLD: Here.
