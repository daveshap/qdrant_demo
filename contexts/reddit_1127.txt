Does anyone have the thought of, f*** it if I’m willing to take my life, than how can I not be willing to just go live in HAWAII and work whatever shitty job I have to just to be there…?
Hawaii isn’t some cure for my mental health issues (and I just say Hawaii because I live in the US).   
 But I saw this documentary about HAPPINESS and it was about who the happiest people in the world seem to be. I noticed a lot of them were little villages of people on small off-the-grid tropical islands. Living off fish and the islands fruit. Simple life living, no bullshit societal stipulations that f\*\*\* with your head…. just the sound of a breeze, the crashing of waves, and the beautiful sunny landscape filled with the stillness of nature. 

Maybe no one relates to this. 

Maybe this is just wishful thinking. 

Maybe it’s just the concept of “if I’m going to feel like hell, I might as well feel it in an absolutely breathtaking place where things are just a lot more chill and peaceful.
