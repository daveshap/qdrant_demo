Applying to jobs and grad school at the same time
Does anyone have any advice for applying to "real world" jobs and grad school at the same time? I'm a senior undergrad. 

Should I wait for a decision from a school before I being applying or not applying for jobs?

Is it taboo to accept a job offer and then decide to go to grad school instead?
