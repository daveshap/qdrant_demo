I got up and went out for some sunlight today :)
It's mostly cold and damp or gloomy. But today it was sunny and when it's sunny it is a great feeling. So I decided to get out of my house and not stay couped up and just get some sunshine. We all hear that sunlight is important to feeling better when it comes to depression but try to ignore the science explanation we're all given and just imagine or feel the sunlight hit your body and how good it feels. I hope you all have a great day and hopefully get some sunshine :).
