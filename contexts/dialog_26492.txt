JEREMY: Awesome!
SUPERMAN: Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
JEREMY: I'll try. . .
JEREMY: Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
SUPERMAN: Go on . . .
JEREMY: But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
SUPERMAN: Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
