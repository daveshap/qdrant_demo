Boot Issues: How to switch from USB to internal SSD (after installing from USB) I'm new to Linux, but just loaded and installed Ubuntu 16.04.2 on my nephew's HP Pavilion Laptop (15-n037ncl).Everything seems to be working fine except that the USB flash drive I used is now recognized as the primary drive, and I can't seem to figure out how to install and boot from the internal SSD. When I remove the USB drive and try to boot, it says there is no OS recognized.Any help is greatly appreciated.
