Divide analogue signal I tried to reproduce entire car air conditioning. The system has two cards. First one is the one where the buttons are: Hotter; Colder ; Stronger ; Weaker.There are 3 pins connected which are GND ; +12 V ; and Data.The other card read signal from data pin (which is analog) and send it to the air conditioning module (j255) through 6 UART frame.Everything going right except reproduce analog signal on the data pin from the first card...The second card sends ~5\u00a0V on the data pin to the first card (if it's disconnected the first card has 0\u00a0V on the data pin).The voltage of data pin (by measurement on the original system):No button pressed : ~5\u00a0VStronger : 2.4\u00a0VWeaker:1.8VCooler:0.6VHotter:0VI don't understand how I can reproduce it...a pin which provides default voltage to the first card (5 V), but where this voltage decreased in function of switches on this first card...Thx !Let me know if you need any further explanations !
