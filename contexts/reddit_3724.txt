It's okay to be desperate.
Everyone wants to love and be loved. It is human nature to seek companionship. There is nothing wrong with being 'desperate'. Those who have the most love to give and want to give it the most are seen as the most desperate and those who are seen as the most desperate are seen as the least attractive. This is ass-backward logic. If you want someone who is going to treat you right, find someone who is desperate to be with you. Having someone be uninterested in you means they're not going to care about your feelings. People need to stop going after people who aren't interested in them. That's all I wanted to say, thank you for your time.
