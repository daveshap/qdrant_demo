Good employment agencies, how do you find them?
I've had a decent amount of contact with job agencies in my two years since college, and the way they operated always made it feel like they were scamming me or teasing me. So I generally developed the attitude of disregarding them as a way to find a job.

However now I'm having a hard time finding a job and someone whose opinion I respect recommended using an employment agency. I did a little research and it seems like the trick is finding a good one and sticking with them, because there are a lot of bad ones just trying to make money off you. Similar to how you should find a good mechanic and stick with them.

But how do you go about finding a good one?
