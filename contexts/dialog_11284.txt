HENRY: I didn't know, I swear. I thought it was next week.
KAREN: Liar!
HENRY: Take it easy. We can talk about it.
HENRY: She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes. I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
KAREN: Talk? To you? After what you did!
HENRY: I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
