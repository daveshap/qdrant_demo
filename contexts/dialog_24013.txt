ELAINE: Hello?
SIMONE: Hello, is this Elaine?
ELAINE: Yes -- oh my, God. Is that you, Simone?! I've been wanting to talk to you.
SIMONE: Well, here I am. You look pretty today. Red suits you.
ELAINE: Where are you?
SIMONE: Right beside you. I borrowed Viktor's car.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late. I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
ELAINE: No, I understand. That's what I want to talk about. I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go. I owe Viktor everything.
ELAINE: I think he owes more to you. But that's not important now. I know what's going on between you two.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
ELAINE: You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone. I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: I'm not -- He's not.
ELAINE: My God, are you alright, Simone?
SIMONE / VIKTOR: Damn -- Yes -- I -- -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship. We could never be anything else. We're just so... different.
ELAINE: Exactly. You're a household name now. You're moving in entirely different worlds. That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
ELAINE: We have a daughter together. I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love. I only make love to the camera.
ELAINE: Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing. I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: Christ -- Elaine, I know how it looks but... ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
ELAINE: Okay -- for you.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: Thanks. This is my exit so, I --
ELAINE: I'm glad we talked.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: Good-bye.
