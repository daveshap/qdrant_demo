MARY: Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
STEVE: Since I can remember, Ma'am.
MARY: But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
STEVE: It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
MARY: Don't you even know your letters?
