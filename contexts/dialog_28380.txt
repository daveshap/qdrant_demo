SNYDER: Which way are the rooms?
BILLIE: Who told ya this guy was in here?
SNYDER: Nobody. I just know what kinda women he likes. I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
BILLIE: Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
SNYDER: I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
BILLIE: Right through there. But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
SNYDER: What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
BILLIE: I don't have to. You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall.
