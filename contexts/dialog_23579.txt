JILL: Will we live together?
GEORGE: We live together now.
JILL: But in the same house, you know, one house.
GEORGE: -- Sure.
JILL: Maybe you don't even like children.
GEORGE: Of course I like children.
JILL: You've never even been around one.
GEORGE: I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
JILL: Yeah.
GEORGE: Okay... Night, baby.
JILL: George?
GEORGE: What!
JILL: Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
GEORGE: Okay, baby. Okay...
JILL: Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
PETTIS: Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
GEORGE: Right.
PETTIS: How is she?
GEORGE: Great.
PETTIS: Wonderful woman.
GEORGE: She is.
PETTIS: I went to school with her husband.
GEORGE: Great.
PETTIS: So you want to go in business for yourself?
GEORGE: Right.
PETTIS: And you need money?
GEORGE: Right, that's right.
PETTIS: You do know what money's like these days.
GEORGE: Well, yeah... you know.
PETTIS: Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
GEORGE: They are?
PETTIS: After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
GEORGE: I guess not...
PETTIS: It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
PETTIS: What sort of references do you have?
GEORGE: Well, I do Barbara Rush.
PETTIS: Pardon me?
GEORGE: Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
PETTIS: I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
JACKIE: I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
JILL: Who is that?
JACKIE: A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
JACKIE: Hi, Leonard.
LEONARD: Jackie, what're you doing?
JACKIE: Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
LEONARD: I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
JACKIE: Poster-Kleiser.
LEONARD: Oh yeah?
JACKIE: That's right.
LEONARD: I'll call you.
JACKIE: Fine.
LEONARD: See you later.
JACKIE: Anyway, you're crazy.
JILL: I am? I mean why?
JACKIE: Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
JILL: I'm not. Maybe I am.
JACKIE: No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
JACKIE: Well, he is.
JILL: So what's your point?
JACKIE: Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
JILL: I know, I'm sorry.
JACKIE: I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
JILL: George is great but I know what you mean.
JACKIE: Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
JILL: I guess not.
GEORGE: I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
PETTIS: Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
JILL: Egypt?
POPE: That's right.
JILL: But why Egypt?
POPE: Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
PRODUCER: You seem disappointed.
JILL: No... how long did you say?
PRODUCER: Three weeks.
