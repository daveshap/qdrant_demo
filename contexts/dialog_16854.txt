ARCHIE: You're a damn liar.
ARCHIE: You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
MALCOLM: It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
ARCHIE: You know it.
MALCOLM: I'll give you back the 600.
ARCHIE: I don't want your money.
MALCOLM: I'm wearing, Archie.
ARCHIE: There's two guns on you.
MALCOLM: And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
ARCHIE: That's what it is. Walk on out.
MALCOLM: Let Billie finish.
ARCHIE: Now.
SOPHIA: You had the number.
MALCOLM: Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
ARCHIE: The dirty yellow rat bastard.
SAMMY: Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
ARCHIE: What you say?
SAMMY: He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
