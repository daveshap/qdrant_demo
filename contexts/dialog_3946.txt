CLIFF: What are you bitching about now?
EVE: What are you doing here?
CLIFF: I forgot some of my stuff.
EVE: Your stuff? Let me see that.
EVE: You came back for these?
CLIFF: Hey, they're Ralph Laurens. And who's this interesting looking fellow?
EVE: This is Adam. Adam, meet Cliff.
ADAM: How do you do?
CLIFF: I do fine, Adam. How 'bout yourself? You doin' any good?
EVE: Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
CLIFF: Shana Gillroy's apartment. Remember her? The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going! Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
ADAM: Why, thank you! Very nice to have met you, Cliff! May I ask you a question?
EVE: He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months. And yes, I'll admit it. I've still kind of got a thing for him. That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
ADAM: Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
EVE: What?!
TROY: Eve! This guy is un-be-liev-able!
EVE: I knew you'd like him.
TROY: Darlin', this is X-File stuff! Think about it! The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big. Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
ADAM: You have very nice ceilings.
TROY: I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
ADAM: Not particularly.
TROY: Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or nori" if you prefer. I love sushi."
ADAM: I love Lucy!
TROY: You nut!
EVE: Here you go. One champagne cocktail.
ADAM: Thank-Q!
EVE: I thought only hookers drank those things.
ADAM: Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
