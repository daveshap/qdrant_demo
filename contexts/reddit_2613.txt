Got fired from a toxic workplace but feel guilty?
I am 25 years old and I recently got fired from an extremely toxic work environment where I was working close to 50-60 hours a week but being paid for only 40, sometimes even on weekends to meet deadlines. It was taking a toll on me but I decided to try my best because it was an extremely well known company. On top of it, coworkers abused me on the internal chat and my manager didn’t pay any heed to it. However, the work culture is pretty well known to be harsh and cutthroat. I didn’t realise it was that bad before I joined.

During the mid term review of my probation they just said that I’m not a good fit for this position and handed me a letter of termination. I sunk and felt even more miserable than I was when I had the job. Now I’m in a confusing state of mind of being unemployed but also can’t help myself of thinking I could’ve tried harder or maybe tried to do things differently. 

I don’t know what to do or where to go from here. Can anyone help me with some reassurance that what happened, happened for the best? Or is this on me?

EDIT: Thanks for all the support and love that you're giving me in spite of not knowing me personally. I truly feel better having seen these comments after the horrendous couple of months I spent at my workplace. You people are so understanding and great. Bless you all.
