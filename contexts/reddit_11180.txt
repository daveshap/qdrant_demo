My brother is dying.... Alone....
Warning - multiple f bombs.

My brother was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery to break up blood clots in his lungs.  That was Thursday.  Today is Monday. His wife, daughter and our parents have not been allowed into the hospital to see him. I'm 400 miles away and not supposed to travel so I can't be down there to support and grieve with my family, much less see my brother before he dies.  

He's getting progressively worse.  I'm expecting a call from my parents today telling me I no longer have a brother.

I am so **fucking** angry.  I have accepted that he will die in the next few years; his health has declined to the point that we all expected something like this was going to happen in the near future.  None of us expected to not be able to be with him when it does.

There are ZERO cases of the virus in that hospital.  They could very easily triage visitors the same way they are employees. But they won't. 

Because they are fucking heartless.  

**My brother is going to die alone in a fucking hospital because they won't let his family in to be by his side.**

But I can stop by Starbucks and get my fucking latte and then hit Mickey D's for a fucking value meal and then have a fucking pizza delivered.

This close to saying fuck everyone, I'm driving my ass down there and you WILL be letting my brothers wife and daughter in to see him or I WILL go completely ape shit right there in the parking lot.  Yeah, I'll end up in jail but the whole fucking world will know about it, cuz YouTube.  (note-I won't be doing it, but damn it feels good to type it). 

Thanks for reading this.  I hope your day is going much better than mine.
