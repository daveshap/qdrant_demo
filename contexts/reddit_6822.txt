I was laid off two days ago, closure interview?
  My job closed down mid March with plans to reopen after the lockdown was over. I worked here for 5 years and during this time had my son and unfortunately became a single parent. 

 My (then, when my son came) bosses reassured me that they would accommodate my childcare schedule no problem. Year 4, new management came in (young with no children) and basically got fed up with accommodating my schedule restraints (9-5, daycare hours). 

  Lockdown came and I was told I would have a job no problem as soon as the county reopened. Well they called on Friday and told me that they could no longer work with my schedule and decided on separation. When I asked what the official reason for separation was, they replied “my inability to get childcare”. As if I could afford to have an on-call nanny, who is completely available 24/7. (My job has double shifts and puts out the schedule 3 days before the work week).


 Now they want me to come in on Tuesday for  a “closure” interview. I’m terrified they’re going to offer me the option to resign on good terms (no unemployment) or be fired (unemployment but bad on resume).

  I feel betrayed by a workplace who preaches family values and job security. 

What should I do?
