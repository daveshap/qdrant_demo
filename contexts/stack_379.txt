Sticky notes in Ubuntu 17.04 disappear after a shutdown I'm using Ubuntu 17.04 and have the Gnome Flashback installed. I very much like sticky notes and they are very useful in everyday tasks for me.I would take matters into my hands but my knowledge is very poor about linux as I have been using it since December 2016. I can't even find where in the hard drive is this applet located to investigate something about the issue.
