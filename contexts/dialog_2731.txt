RODERICK: But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
CHEVALIER: Have no fear. It will come out well for me.
RODERICK: I believe they will deport you.
CHEVALIER: I have faced that problem before.
RODERICK: But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
CHEVALIER: Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you. Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin. The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
RODERICK: But how, sir?
MINISTER GALGENSTEIN: The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
RODERICK: When is he to go?
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN: Has he sent the challenge yet?
RODERICK: Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
MINISTER GALGENSTEIN: Then this must be done tomorrow.
RODERICK: What is to be done?
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN: You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner. When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
RODERICK: And his baggage?
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN: Oh! That will be sent after him. I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn. You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival. We must force that box. You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
