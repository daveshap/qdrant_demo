why is it so hard to make it out of poverty?
fuck man, where do i start,

some days i feel like ending my life like  dead serious because i lost my father this year and i cant get a job, cant afford college and i am a month away from age 22 and havent accomplished shit yet because i have no talent, no transportation, no role models because i stay in the projects where role models do not exist.

&#x200B;

everyday i wake up and just feel an urge of saddness because it feels like i live in a maze of waking up to just lift weights, apply to jobs, get no reply and just go back to sleep and do the same thing for the past 3 years.

&#x200B;

what the hell am i suppose to do without having role models and no guidance in life as a 21 year old?

my mom and i are so poor that we dont even have 1 dollars combined in the bank account and i dont know where to start
