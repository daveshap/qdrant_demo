CHILDS: We don't know. West is dead.
MUELLER: They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
KENDALL: Poor fucker my ass...
MUELLER: You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
CHILDS: What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
DUNBAR: What do you mean, alone?
MUELLER: Pike and I got separated --
KENDALL: Yeah and he doesn't know when --
MUELLER: I remember now, it was before the explosion --
KENDALL: Oh, you remember now --
MUELLER: I'm about two seconds away from seeing if fairies really can fly --
