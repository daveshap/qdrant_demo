DANA: I wish I could stay. I feel personally responsible for you being here.
VENKMAN: You are personally responsible. If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
DANA: Please don't say that. You won't go to prison.
VENKMAN: Don't worry about me. I'm like a cat.
DANA: You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
VENKMAN: I'm El Gato. I always land on my feet.
DANA: Good luck.
VENKMAN: Thanks.
