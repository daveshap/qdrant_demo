Does this type of living arrangement exist?
TLDR; I am willing to pay 2-3 hundo a month for a bed and a shower on Monday night/Tuesday morning only for class. Is this realistic or completely unheard of? Help.

I’m a full time employee for an agency that is paying my college tuition. Unfortunately they do not allow online courses and the campus is over 25 miles from my house but only 5 miles from my work—plus it is a downtown campus so parking will be brutal and I’ll probably park at a Starbucks uptown and hop on the light rail. I’m looking to take 2 classes on Monday nights from 2pm to 9pm and then a Tuesday class from 6-9pm. 

I would really like to have a place to crash on Mondays near the light rail or campus. I would just need to sleep, shower and go to work the next morning to save insane amounts of time and I would LOVE to avoid city commute—possibly even bus to work. I would be willing to pay up to $250-$300 a month for this type of arrangement—again, it would only be Monday night weekly for a semester. Is this unheard of? Where would I go to find people willing to do this? Obviously it would be supplemental income rather than a full blown sublet. I’ve thought about talking with hotels or making Airbnb arrangements. I could pay entire semester upfront. Should I just suck it up and waste 2-3 hours on the freeway every day? I own my home and moving isn’t an option at this moment because I love my house. Not sure how to proceed.
