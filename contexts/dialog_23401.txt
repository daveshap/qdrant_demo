MARY: I'm afraid not.
MRS. REDI: That's too bad.
MRS. REDI: What did she want?
FRANCES: I did her hair.
MRS. REDI: What were you talking about?
FRANCES: Nothing.
MRS. REDI: Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
FRANCES: She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
MRS. REDI: And that was all?

MRS. REDI: What did she want to know?
FRANCES: She showed me a drawing.
MRS. REDI: You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
