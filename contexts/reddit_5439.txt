Certifications for Admin Work?
Hey friends,

I'm looking to get an entry level job in admin assist work and am thinking of getting a data entry certification to put on my resume. I'm also thinking of getting other certifications that may relate. Is this a good idea? and if so, where should I go to get these certifications?
