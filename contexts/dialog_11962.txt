FREDERICK: Isn't it enough that I can love you?
LEE: Mmm...
FREDERICK: Hmm?
LEE: ...you're such a puzzle. So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.
FREDERICK: Well, there was a time when you were very happy to be only with me. You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
LEE: Mm-hm.
FREDERICK: Have I really taught you everything I have to give? I don't think so.
