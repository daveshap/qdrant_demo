What does it mean to run a country "like a business" and whatâ€™s the history of attempts to do so?
While campaigning for president, Donald Trump [touted his plans to "run the United States like a business."](https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2016/02/donald_trump_gets_big_crowd_bi.html) But what does it mean to run a country like a business and has that historically been a successful approach?

Shortly after the election, the president's son in-law and senior advisor, [Jared Kushner, said,](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-son-law-jared-kushner-oversee-government-overhaul-n738801) "The government should be run like a great American company. Our hope is that we can achieve successes and efficiencies for our customers, who are the citizens." It's not exactly clear what "successes" means when your customers are the citizens, but I think this gives some insight into the administration's thinking on the matter.

[This opinion piece](https://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/the-smarter-mutual-fund-investor/2011/09/14/5-reasons-the-government-should-be-run-like-a-business) says running a country like a business means you do five things: balance the budget, restrict the money supply to control inflation, lay off non-productive workers, rework the benefit plans to maximize economic advantage, and discard poorly performing units (i.e., the Post Office).

The intro blurb to [this podcast](https://www.marketplace.org/2017/01/24/business/can-government-be-run-business) says making government run like a business means "walking away from negotiations, always getting the best deal, and negotiating the lowest possible costs."

So, is it possible to come up with solid definition of what it means to run government like a business? 

[Singapore is a country that is said to be run like a business.](http://fortune.com/2015/03/23/singapore-leekuanyew-corporation-1974/) It achieved explosive growth of GDP and living standards under such an approach in the decades after independence.

Is that a good historical example of such an approach being successful? Are there other examples?

What aspects of government (economics, trade, social services, tax policy, infrastructure, etc.) are most and least amenable to being run like a business?
