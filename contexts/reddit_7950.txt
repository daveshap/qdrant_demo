Should I follow-up email a 3rd time?
Hi. I am finding a rotation opportunity in a prof's lab so I shot him a first common type of email with my CV and interests and how I want to talk to her in-person. She then said glad to talk but without giving time. So I followed up and said I have these times available. She replied a bit late and picked a time that had been filled, so I followed up again saying that I still have these times available. However, after 3 days, she didn't reply at all. In this case, how can I keep the conversation so we can meet eventually? Is she mad at me?
