Best friend is implying I’m to blame for her suicidal thoughts
I’ve been best friends with this girl for 4 years and it seems every problem I have she has after.  I was suicidal then she was, I had anxiety she had anxiety, I cut she cut....etc. We were always super close but I recently got a boyfriend and started to work which left less time to spend with her. She got admitted to the hospital for suicidal thoughts and when she got back she told me I wasn’t there when she needed me. I obviously feel terrible but I don’t think it’s entirely my fault. How should I respond to that.
