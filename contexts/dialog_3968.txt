ARON: We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
ADAM: Come where?
ARON: My office.
ADAM: For how long?
ARON: Well, that depends...
ADAM: I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
EVE: Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing. The best thing for you. I promise.
ADAM: ...All right, Eve. If you say so.
EVE: ...I do.
ADAM: Could I please just go home? I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
ARON: Let's go talk first, Adam.
ADAM: Yes, ma'am.
TROY: Good-bye, Adam.
ADAM: Goodbye.
