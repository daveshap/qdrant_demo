WILKINS: Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
CLAUDE: Sure, boss.
WILKINS: I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
JAKE: So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
LEON: No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
JAKE: Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
WILLIE: Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
LEON: Just like Elvis.
WILLIE: Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
JAKE: That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
LEON: What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
