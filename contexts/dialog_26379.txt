GUS: Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
ROSS: Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
ROSS: You've been a naughty boy haven't you? C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
GUS: Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
ROSS: Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- dig where you're comin' from." You want to be rich
GUS: Uh...
ROSS: Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
GUS: Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
ROSS: I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
GUS: Or socks.
ROSS: Yes! That never occurred to me. Her ya go, buddy, single-malt. Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
GUS: 'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
