\"relative to\" vs \"divided by\" Regarding \"x = A/B\" like the following examples, which is \"x equals A divided by B,\" is it correct to say \"x is A relative to B\" (e.g., \"winners relative to total applicants\") when I want to express in everyday language instead of mathematical terms? In other words, can \"divided by\" and \"relative to\" be used interchangeably? If not, what would be more appropriate ways to say these expressions?x = A/B x = winners/total applicants   x = adult population/total population  x = expenses/total earningsThese expressions (without \"x =\") are in the subject line of a table (with calculated numbers) and I would like to explain them in writing using non-mathematical language.     Many thanks in advance!
