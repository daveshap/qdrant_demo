MARIETTE: Yes, Gaston?
GASTON: What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
MARIETTE: I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
GASTON: Call the police?
MARIETTE: Instantly.
GASTON: Um-<u>hum</u> ...
MARIETTE: But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
GASTON: You look beautiful.
MARIETTE: Thank you. Seventy-six, eighty--
GASTON: Mariette!
MARIETTE: Yes, Gaston?
GASTON: You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
MARIETTE: <u>Adolph</u>?
GASTON: Adolph J. Giron.
MARIETTE: And you expect me to believe that?
GASTON: Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it.
