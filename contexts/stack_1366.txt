Logic Translation with Different Ground Reference I have two chips which communicate with each other using 1.8v CMOS I/O (1Mbs UART). One chip is on the normal 0v ground plane, but the second chip's ground is at .7v (so its I/O operates at 2.5v for high and .7v for low with reference to first chip's 0v ground). Im trying to figure out the best way to translate these logic levels so I/O works correctly between them. One option is to just connect them with no level shifting, in which case the the first chip would be seeing 2.5v instead of 1.8v for high (it should be able to tolerate), and .7v for low instead of 0v (which would probably not be reliable for 1.8v low logic which is around .45v to be safe). Other option is to use something like TXS0102, with its ground referenced to 0v. Two questions with this, the low .7v signal from Chip 2 will be fed to the input of the TXS0102, but will this be low enough to trigger a 0v output for chip 1? Second when chip 1 is sending a low signal to Chip 2, since it will be driven down to 0v chip 2 will see that as -.7v. Will this cause issues with the logic gate over time if its logic gate keeps seeing negative voltage for low?Am I overcomplicating this an is there a simpler way to do this with voltage dividers for slow 1Mbs logic?
