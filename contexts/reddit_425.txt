I just need advice
okay I'm not sure how to start this off  but I'll give you a background. I've been feeling off lately. Back around the end of 2017 like in mid September and through august of 2018 I was in an episode of sadness. (Im not going to call it a depressive episode because I was not diagnosed with depression or anything of the sort.) I didn't recieve any help throughout the time and just bottled up everything and covered it up with a goofy personality I created. I tried to discuss it with adults in my life but they shook it off saying I was going through a phase and that it will go away as time goes. Now Ive been realizing changes that I haven't noticed that began around july of this year. I've been unmotivated to do anything, All the love and passion I had for certain activities went away. It's hard for me to remember any joy or pleasure I had. Through the small period of August of 2018 till July of 2019 I had burst of high energy (like in small episode 1-2 weeks every other week). And at this point I'm just confused. 

I'm not sure if I should talk to my doctor about this problem if I do I just have an underlying concern or worry that they'll contact CPS. (we've had trouble in the past with them but it wasn't anything major but it was scary.) I'm just confused on what to do next.

p.s. I haven't talked to anyone indepth about what I went through. I don't think I can trust my friends about my struggles and prefer to keep them out of my problem to not bother them. I'm sorry
