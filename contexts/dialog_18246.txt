SHY WAITER: When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
PERRY: What happened?
SHY WAITER: She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
LORETTA: What time is it?
MR. JOHNNY: Seven-thirty.
LORETTA: So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
