Interviewed for Financial Analyst position, Feel like I was bait and switched.
So I applied for a temp to hire financial analyst role in a smaller town through Accounttemps (Robert Half) one evening last week. I got a callback the next morning and scheduled an interview for today. When I did the interview the recruiter basically talked about how they would be looking for roles which are a good fit for me and we would be in touch about them. When I asked about the specific job I had applied for, he said that role is through another office in another city and he would check with that office. The other thing was salary. I have admittedly limited experience in finance, but I have enough other experience and degrees where all the research I have done suggests that I should be able to make anywhere between 48k - 56k starting depending on where in the country I am. The specific role I applied to was entry level and well within that range. They talked about how people starting out in this area typically start at 30 - 35. I find that difficult to believe as this is a larger metro with high costs of living. 

To recap:

First, when I set up the interview it was clearly for the specific role I applied for and when I got there it was just "we'll find you a job!". Second, if the role I applied for was through a different Robert Half office, why did I interview with this one? Third, the entry level pay advertised was MUCH higher than what they told me in person to expect. I think they posted a good job to get candidates like me to apply...
