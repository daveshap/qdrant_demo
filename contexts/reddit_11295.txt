I have a 4 month dry erase calendar that’s completely wrong
I keep trying to map out things. Over the last month my career has kept shifting. My calendar plans out my lsat study schedule for taking on the March lsat. I don’t want to erase it yet because I want to go to raise my score and go back to law school but I know it makes no sense for me financially right now. Also the deadline for registration is in 2 days. I'm not registering. It bothers me because the calendar is inaccurate. It’s the first thing I see when I wake up and it’s a reminder that i am a failure. It also has an exercise routine that I have ignored lately. I hate myself
