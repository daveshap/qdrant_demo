ELSA LANCHESTER: Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
ERNEST THESIGER: Oh no, my dear. You look absolutely amazing. There's no way I can compete with you. The scene is yours.
ELSA LANCHESTER: In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
ERNEST THESIGER: I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
ELSA LANCHESTER: More your line.
ERNEST THESIGER: My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin. Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
