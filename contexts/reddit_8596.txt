Why is Trump doing so much better in the tracking polls than standard polls?
There seems to be a huge difference between the tracking polls and standard polls regarding this election. Please correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the 3 main tracking polls in this election are the LA Times poll, IBD/TIPP, and Rasmussen Reports. As of Friday, he was either + 1 or 2 in each of those polls but every other poll has him down btwn 5-8 ish points. I don't understand how the discrepancy here is so big. What gives and which polls are historically accurate?
