HEIDI: Hey, Sonny! I'm watchin' it on TV!
SONNY: What about the kids?
HEIDI: They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors. Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you. I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
SONNY: Heidi, I'm dying.
HEIDI: I blame myself, Sonny. I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me. And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids. It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it! Yellin' at me in front of all those people. Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never. I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
SONNY: Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
HEIDI: See? You're screaming with the language and all! A person can't communicate with you. You become a stranger in your own home...
HEIDI: ...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me. Can you imagine, marrying another man? Did I do something to make you do that? Did I ever turn you down, or anything? The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places! And I let myself get fat.
SONNY: Don't call yourself fat.
HEIDI: I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat. Like I can't stand you being a bank robber. I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
SONNY: Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
HEIDI: Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever. You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
SONNY: They're not after you, they're after me.
HEIDI: Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal. I couldn't get a baby sitter.
