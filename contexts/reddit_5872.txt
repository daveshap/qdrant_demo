Are entry level professional certificates worth it if I'm not working in that field?
My long term career goal is to work in records management. Most jobs I've seen require a higher education or experience level than I have. ARMA, one of the relevant professional groups, has an [entry level certificate program](https://www.arma.org/page/EssentialsOfRIM?), but it sounds like it's more for people who already have a job managing records. I've considered trying to get that experience through payroll or human resources, and there are entry level [professional](https://www.americanpayroll.org/education-certification/certification/fundamental-payroll-certification-fpc) [certificates](https://www.hrci.org/our-programs/our-certifications/) for those too, but again, it looks like it's more for people already working in those fields, rather than people looking to break in. Is that notion correct? Is it worth taking these programs without having relevant experience? Will employers care?

For context, I have a Bachelors degree in communications and work experience in myriad environments, but nothing in a managerial capacity. Just data entry/retail/warehouse/restaurant/light administrative.
