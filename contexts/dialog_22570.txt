CARTER: How'd what go?
JOHNSON: With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
CARTER: Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of. They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type. He is like the baddest Asian shield they got. And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him. Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
JOHNSON: They put you in charge?
CARTER: In Charge. Just me'n him. No interference. They don't even want to hear from us until we're done. I love the F.B.I. I love the F.B.I.
JOHNSON: Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
CARTER: Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
JOHNSON: OK. Well...make us proud. And be careful.
