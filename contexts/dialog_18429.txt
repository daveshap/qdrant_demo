PAINE: And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--

PAINE: I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
TAYLOR: Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
