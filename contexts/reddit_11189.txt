Unused toothbrush
Not sure how long this will turn out to be, I haven't slept and this has been on my mind all night.

I work on an Alzheimer's unit as a cna. We had an admission a couple nights ago, I never really met the guy because he was on the other section of the floor. As he had only been in for a few hours his wife didn't really know her way around and came over to my side with a toothbrush that she had just gotten him. because she was new and I had no reason to think she was a family member that would end up being a huge pain in the ass I figured I would help her out. At first i was just going to show her over to the other side but I figured "hey I might as well help her out, it's better than passing trays." so I showed her to the other side, and when we got there I helped her unbox this brand new toothbrush. So we opened it up, I attached the head for her and wrote the name on the toothbrush and the charging station. All the while she is jokingly pointing out that there's a travel case that he'll probably never use because he won't be going on any trips. I just smile and nod give a little chuckle and put it in his bathroom. I came in the next night and he had been sent out to the hospital. I'm not sure why exactly but one of the nurses told me that his labs were all out of whack and that his kidneys were failing. The whole night after that i couldn't stop thinking about this toothbrush he never used. It was hilarious. The irony was just so crazy to me. Out of everything it's this damn toothbrush that the guy never got to use. sitting there in his bathroom as he's passing away in the hospital. It made me realize more than anything that you never know what could happen to you. This might not be the right sub for this but not sure where else it could belong. live your life like it's about to end because you might not get to use that new toothbrush.
