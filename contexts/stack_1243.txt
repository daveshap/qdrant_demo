DBCC CHECKDB - SQL Log Says Completed, SQL Server Agent Says Failed I run a nightly Integrity Check (set up via Maintenance Plans) on all of my databases. For the last two nights, the final CHECKDBCC has failed... at least according to the SQL Server Agent Job. <blockquote>  Progress: 2019-01-25 03:51:01.15     Source: Check Database Integrity      Executing query \"USE [CellTestData_QC]  \".: 50% complete  End Progress<br>  Error: 2019-01-25 05:14:43.79     Code: 0xC002F210     Source: Check Database Integrity Execute SQL Task     Description: Executing the query \"DBCC CHECKDB(N'CellTestData_QC')  WITH NO_INFOMSGS...\" failed with the following error: \"A severe error occurred on the current command.  The results if any should be disca...  The package execution fa...  The step failed.</blockquote>But if I check the SQL Server Logs, I get two conflicting messages.First I get:<blockquote>  01/25/2019 05:00:39,spid105,Unknown,DBCC CHECKDB (CellTestData_QC) WITH no_infomsgs executed by sa terminated abnormally due to error state 6. Elapsed time: 1 hours 9 minutes 38 seconds.</blockquote>But then I get: <blockquote>  01/25/2019 05:32:06,spid110,Unknown,CHECKDB for database 'CellTestData_QC' finished without errors on 2019-01-24 23:01:46.507 (local time). This is an informational message only; no user action is required.</blockquote>So what exactly is going on here? Is my process completing? Or erroring out?For a bit more context...We restore [CellTestData_QC] every morning at 5AM (likely why I'm getting the SQL Server Log message of 'terminated abnormally at 5AM). Additionally, my backups of [CellTestData] and integrity checks of [CellTestData] and [CellTestData_QC] have been taking longer over the last few days - possibly because of issues with our SAN, which is why we're getting the IntegrityCheck of [CellTestData_QC] beginning to run into the restore of [CellTestData_QC]Integrity checks run every night at 11PMDB backups (full and partial) run nightlyTransaction Log backups run every 15minCurrently working with 8 databases, that range in size from 4MB to 100GB, with a total of 330GB of databasesI'm running SQL Server Standard 2012 on a 64-bit Windows Server VM (using vSphere) with 64GB RAM, 1TB SAN storage, 175GB NAS storage, 4CPU, 4.9GHzAny ideas what might be going on here?
