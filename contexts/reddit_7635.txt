When listing employment on a resume, how do some of you list professional work you've done as a student?
I am building my resume and I've go to a university where much of our coursework is centered around real world assignments. I'm curious what os the appropriate way I should document this on a resume. 

For example let's say I developed a program evaluation for a local community center... for "my employer" should I list my university or should I list the community center. And for job title...since I wasn't officially employed...what is a good way to identify myself...intern/analyst/planner/consultant/advisor. 

I've had the opportunity multiple semester to do some really unique work for different organizations that would make my resume look strong. Some of my work as a student stands put more than my professional jobs. I want to list them ethically and not deceive people reviewing my resumes into thinking I was a paid employee of these places.  Im curious how some of you handle this and how you display it on your resumes...
