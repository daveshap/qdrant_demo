BUFFY: Have you guys seen Jeffrey? The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.

BUFFY: Oh.
BUFFY: I'm glad you guys are here. It's good to see you.

BUFFY: You look way pretty, Kim.
KIMBERLY: I know. I like your little outfit.
NICOLE: It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
KIMBERLY: As long as there's room for three in it. What, didn't you bring your new friends?
