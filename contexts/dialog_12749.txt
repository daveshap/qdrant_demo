INSPECTOR: Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon. Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse. It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
MORAN: Round up who you can and put them on standby.
INSPECTOR: Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
MORAN: No. I want this to be all ours.
