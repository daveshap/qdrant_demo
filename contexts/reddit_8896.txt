Should the media in the US be more regulated?
Something Marco Rubio said about the recent events in Chicago struck me:

>And I want to be frank, and I'm not talking about any of you in particular because I know you don't make these decisions, but I hope the US media begins to examine the role they play in all this. Because for months I can tell you I've been giving speeches on public policy and nobody paid a lot of attention. And the minute I mentioned anything personal about Donald Trump the media cut in live to my speeches hoping I would say more of it. So then they could go on the air and say, "oh this is so sad," subtitle, 'we're going to keep giving it coverage because its good for our ratings.' 

>So I think we need as a, the media needs to examine the role it's played in creating this atmosphere, because I know it's good for ratings, but it's really detrimental to our political culture. And uh, and to our country at large

Should media be held partially accountable for this? Should they be regulated in order to get a more intellectual narrative as Rubio would like? Is what we have right now actually the best system?
