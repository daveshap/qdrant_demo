BETTY: Rosa, so you've met David?
ROSA: Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
BETTY: Oh, he does that. It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
GEORGE: I don't think your friend likes me.
BETTY: She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men... So where are we going?
GEORGE: Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
