ISABELLA: My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs. You cannot be armed. If you're carrying, it has to go. Or stow it inside. No one will go near your boat...
CROCKETT: You do business in Cuba with your husband?
ISABELLA: I never do business in Cuba. And nobody goes to Cuba but me. And he is not my husband...
CROCKETT: Were you born in Havana?
ISABELLA: Angola. My mother was being a surgeon there. She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too... ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world. She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
CROCKETT: Where's she now?
ISABELLA: She's dead...
CROCKETT: Your father?
ISABELLA: Angolan Military. Went back to the fighting. Disappeared. Who knows...?
CROCKETT: How's he not your husband?
ISABELLA: I am no one's wife. I live in my own house. I do not live in a man's house. He has a wife. We are together. I am free. Because of banking and finance and travel... And I can do anything I want...
CROCKETT: Mojitas...?
ISABELLA: Later! Do you dance?
CROCKETT: I dance...
