DAVIS: I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
MULEY: Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
DAVIS: For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
MULEY: But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
DAVIS: *Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
GIRL: What's he fixin' to do, ma?
MA: Hush!
MULEY: Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
DAVIS: You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
