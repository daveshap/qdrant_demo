EVELYN: I want a firm commitment.
BATEMAN: I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
EVELYN: Why? What's wrong?
BATEMAN: My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
BATEMAN: We need to talk.
EVELYN: Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
BATEMAN: It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
EVELYN: Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
BATEMAN: I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
EVELYN: But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work. You have a little something on your upper lip.
BATEMAN: I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
EVELYN: You're really serious, aren't you?
BATEMAN: Yes, I am.
EVELYN: But what about the past? Our past?
BATEMAN: We never really shared one.
EVELYN: You're inhuman.
BATEMAN: I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. You're just not terribly important to me.
EVELYN: No, no, no.
BATEMAN: I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
