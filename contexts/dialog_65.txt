PATRICK: Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
KAT: What are you doing here?
PATRICK: I heard there was a poetry reading.
KAT: You 're so --
PATRICK: Pleasant?
PATRICK: Wholesome.
KAT: Unwelcome.
PATRICK: Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
KAT: Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
PATRICK: So what did I have an effect on ?
KAT: Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
PATRICK: You were right. She's still pissed.
MICHAEL: Sweet love, renew thy force!
PATRICK: Man -- don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you.
CAMERON: You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
MICHAEL: Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
PATRICK: What's the worst?
CAMERON: You get the girl.
