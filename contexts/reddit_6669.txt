What seemingly innocent questions can I ask recruiters, so that I can infer how their company's truly performing?
Because of COVID-19, due diligence requires me to *politely* question the future prospects, and in some cases, current under-performance of HR of companies who contact me. But HR always answers with just [meaningless corporate jargon or weasel words](https://redd.it/alzkov).  So what other seemingly innocent questions can I ask instead as a workaround proxy? 

These HR are legitimate, and prove their identity by emailing from their corporate address or allowing me to phone their  extension. I research Cash Flow, Income Statements, and Balance Sheets,  but accounting can be forged!
