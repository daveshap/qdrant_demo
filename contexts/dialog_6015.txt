ELENA: So what'd they say?
SALVATORE: The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
ELENA: No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
SALVATORE: Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
ELENA: He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
SALVATORE: Who?
ELENA: The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
SPACCAFICO: Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
SALVATORE: OK...
