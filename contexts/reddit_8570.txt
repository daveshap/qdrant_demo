What are the pros and cons of deregulating lemonade stands and similar small-scale businesses?
Recently there was a case of a [woman calling the police on a child's lemonade stand for lacking a business permit](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article212213524.html) that gained national attention.

What is the purpose of such business permit laws?; How well is it accomplishing that purpose in reference to lemonade stands and similar small-scale businesses?; What are the pros and cons of changing the law to deregulate such small-scale businesses?
