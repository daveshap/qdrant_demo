YOUNG WASHINGTON: I always though London was the place to be: capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
SALLY: The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
YOUNG WASHINGTON: I think America suits you.
SALLY: Do you? When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
YOUNG WASHINGTON: It's the freest land on earth.
SALLY: Is it? Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
YOUNG WASHINGTON: Well, we must be who we must be...
SALLY: And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
YOUNG WASHINGTON: What else should I become? There's no difference between Virginia and England. I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society. My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes. Everyone laughs at me.
SALLY: I don't laugh at you, George. I like you. I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
YOUNG WASHINGTON: I think I will disappoint you.
