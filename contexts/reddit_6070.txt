I was laid off due to COVID-19 on March 20th. Was told my position was eliminated. Today, I just found out that my previous job was listed online a week ago as “open” and is accepting applications.
What is the best approach here?

Previous employer hasn’t reached out to notify me the position is open.

It’s listed on 5 different employment websites, so definitely not a mistake posting.

Also a very specific job with a specific title. So I know it was my previous job.
