remembered a drunken mistake and it's been eating me up
So back in September, I was at a party and everyone there was pretty drunk (I know this is in no way an excuse for my behaviour). Basically, what I remember is that I was flirting with this guy and we had our arms around each other. My hand went down his back and I grabbed his butt. I honestly feel so guilty and ashamed about this.  I would have brought up the incident earlier and apologized, but I had no recollection of any of this until recently, when I saw a picture from that night and it got my memory jogging. It was months ago, and the two of us are friends now. To make matters worse, he is dating one of my best friends (they were not together at the time). My question is whether it would be appropriate to bring it up to him now and apologize, or if that would create drama. I'm genuinely at a lossâ€” even if he wasn't upset about it, I feel disgusting and I hate that I treated another person like that. If anyone can offer me some perspective on the situation, that would be super helpful. Thanks.
