Internal energy of dielectric I have a plate capacitor with a given charge. It is then dipped in a dielectric fluid and I must determine which height the fluid reaches (all the necessary parameters are given). I can solve this problem if I make the following assumption: the polarization of the dielectric does not( or approximately does not) change its internal energy.Is this a reasonable assumption? If so why?
