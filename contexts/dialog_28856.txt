GASTON: One purse-- empty. One vanity case--
MARIETTE: But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
GASTON: Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue? Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
MARIETTE: Oh! You didn't read it!
GASTON: Naturally I did.
MARIETTE: Oh!
GASTON: You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
MARIETTE: M'sieu Laval!
GASTON: But one suggestion, madame. Not the major. I don't mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ... And one lipstick ... Scarlet number four.
MARIETTE: What's wrong now?
GASTON: With your skin, I prefer crimson.
MARIETTE: Too much blue in crimson.
GASTON: That's what you need!
MARIETTE: No, no, no! I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
GASTON: What shade of powder do you use?
MARIETTE: Peaches and cream.
GASTON: That's too dark.
MARIETTE: Do you realize I have light eyes?
GASTON: But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
