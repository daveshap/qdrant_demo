I'm falling for my ex-girlfriend.
like the title says. i'm falling for my ex. we dated about 6 years ago and just randomly started talking again. we are having a lot of fun catching up and i find myself flirting with her again. the worst part is she is flirting back.... I really just don't know what to do.
