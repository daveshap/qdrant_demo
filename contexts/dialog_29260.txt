HATTIE: You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
SUZIE: I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
HATTIE: Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
SUZIE: You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
HATTIE: Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
SUZIE: I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
HATTIE: He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
SUZIE: I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
HATTIE: Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
SUZIE: What must I do?
HATTIE: If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
HARRY: Good afternoon, ladies.
SUZIE: Good afternoon to you.
