SIDNEY: Avidly. He was staring.
RITA: Staring. Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
SIDNEY: He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
RITA: ...cigarette girls... And naturally -
SIDNEY: You were thrilled to be interviewed. Were you interviewed"?"
RITA: In his apartment -
SIDNEY: And where was his wife?
RITA: I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed. In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
SIDNEY: We're old friends, Chickie - quit it! A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter! What did you think would happen in his house?
RITA: But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
