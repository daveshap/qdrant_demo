I’m sad
I (24M) matched with a cute girl (21F) on Tinder, and it seemed like it was going great. We added each other on Snapchat, and we were talking for a week. I just saw she unfollowed me on Snap. My guess is she just lost interest, or I asked if she was free to meet one too many times. Anyways, there’s nothing really to do. Just wanted to tell someone I’m upset.
