NORM: Well, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ...
JOHN: If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
NORM: He started it.
SHAKE: No, I didn't you did ...
GEORGE: Well, what happened?
SHAKE: The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
PAUL: And?
NORM: Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
PAUL: I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
NORM: Y'what?
PAUL: You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
PAUL: Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.
GEORGE: I suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
