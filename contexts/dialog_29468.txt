WOMAN: What do you see as your main strengths?
SPUD: I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
WOMAN: Homeless people?
SPUD: No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
WOMAN: Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
SPUD: No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
MAN 1: Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
SPUD: The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
