BURNS: Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
BRUCE: Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
BURNS: Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
BRUCE: Oh, it isn't like that.
HILDY: It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
BURNS: Mother? But your mother --
BRUCE: No. My mother.
BURNS: Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
