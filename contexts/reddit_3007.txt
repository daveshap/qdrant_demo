I have no Passion?
Hey all. I’m switching careers, because I’m very unhappy and burnt out working with older adults.

The problem is I don’t really have any passion. I’m not passionate about anything. There’s things I like doing; reading, listening to music, watching tv, but I’m not passionate about these things. Just things I enjoy.

I’ve been spending hundreds of hours after work studying coding, because I want to switch into this career. Coding, reading, watching vids, podcasts, articles, etc. But idk if that counts as being passionate or not.

I find coding interesting, challenging, sometimes frustrating.. but aren’t you supposed to feel pumped up or something if it’s a passion? Like “F*** YEAH, I’M GOING TO CODE SOMETHING!!!”

Do you need to be passionate about a career? Can it just be something low-stress you do & then do things you like in your free time?
