With LinkedIn Learning growing so much the last few years, what kind of weight does it carry on a profile or resume?
Personally, if I was a hiring manager and I saw that someone completed a bunch of learning paths, they'd peak my interest because they have continued learning even after they've achieved a college degree.

In the end you are learning skills that give you advantages over others. It's only fair to list it, right?

I'm wondering if anyone has had experience with hiring managers thinking high or low of these, or if they've completed these learning paths and if they've created an uptick in profile views/messages?
