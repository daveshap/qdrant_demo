How long does it take for steam to reject a gift automatically if the receiver don't confirm receipt? If I gift a game to my friend, but he does not click confirm, then how long before it will be rejected automatically by the system? It's near the summer sale now. If my friend gifts me a game, and I do not confirm receipt, but instead wait for the summer sale to see if the price will be lower. Assuming the price is lower, I would ideally reject the gift, have my friend get the refund, and then have them buy the game for me at the lower price. Also, could we be banned for this type of behaviour?
