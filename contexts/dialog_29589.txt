DILLINGER: Come on in...
ALAN: Alan. Alan Bailey.
DILLINGER: Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
ALAN: Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
DILLINGER: oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
ALAN: Yeah...?
DILLINGER: We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons. Someone with that access has been tampering.
ALAN: I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime. I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
DILLINGER: No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
ALAN: It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
DILLINGER: Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
ALAN: No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
DILLINGER: Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
ALAN: Ok
