COLE: Did you think the play sucked big time?
MALCOLM: What?
COLE: Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
MALCOLM: I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk. I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
COLE: Cats?
MALCOLM: Never mind.
