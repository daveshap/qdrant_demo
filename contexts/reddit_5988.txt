Getting tired of customer service/technical support field and I'm burnt out. What would be a certification that I could get self-studying (1 year or less) that would allow me to work without little customer interaction? Something that pays around $50k CDN starting?
Just as the title says, looking for a certification that would take less than a year. Any job is fine as long as I'm not talking to customers all day. I'm seriously tired of dealing with customers. Something that I could study for at my own pace and take the exam whenever I want. Something in demand that will get me around $50k CDN starting. I don't mind if it is a back office job or something more hands on.

Any recommendations welcome.
