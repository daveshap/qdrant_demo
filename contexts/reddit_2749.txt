What kind of well paying jobs exist for introverts?
I will make this a long story short, I’m a nurse and I hate it. I was extroverted and bubbly when I went in, and four years later I am introverted, mean, hardened, and intolerant. I do not want to be a nurse anymore, but it pays well and I have no idea how to start over, or where I should even begin. I am not always myself because of this job, and it is NOT because of the unit I work on. I just cannot handle patients screaming, whining, and taking everything out on me anymore. I need to get out of this and need some guidance. I’m good at a lot of things, I learn quickly, and I am very fast and efficient. At this point I’m willing to learn anything else. I just do not want to be anywhere near a hospital because hospitals do not give a fuck about their employees.

Edit: I received a lot of comments while I was sleeping, and I just want to thank you all for your kind words and suggestions!
