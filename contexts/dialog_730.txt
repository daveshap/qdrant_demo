TED: I have to see Bud Kruger.
RECEPTIONIST: Do you have an appointment, sir?
TED: No, dammit. It's a matter of life or death.
RECEPTIONIST: You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
TED: All right, it's a matter of death.
RECEPTIONIST: Death, death. How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
RECEPTIONIST: You can't go in there!
TED: Don't try to stop me!
RECEPTIONIST: But that's not a door. The door's over there.
