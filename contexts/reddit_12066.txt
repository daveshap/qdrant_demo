I don't have strong emotions
I really want to be an emotional person. I struggle to befriend new people because I do not connect with them on an emotional level. People think I am cool initially but they never find me all that memorable. I really want to change that but I don't know how...

I feel like it is telling stories about myself when they are related to whatever we are talking about. But also I am just trying to find my emotional motivation behind things that basically make up my life. I imagine it is important for when people ask what major I am or why I chose to join the Air Force. And I just have no idea what my emotions are behind them. I started writing down what I believe my emotional reasoning/motivation behind what I do and I showed it to my friend and he told me "You're kidding yourself with some of the stuff you said" so I guess I don't know what my emotions are behind them- if I even have any. 

So as you can see I am a very logical person. Everything I do in my mind is just because of logic. It just makes sense for me to be an engineer and it just makes sense for me to be in the AF but I mean...at some point it must've started from an emotion even though of course both of those things will lead me to success in character and money-wise. Maybe I just need to evaluate what my goals are in life first?

Just a side note: I am a 20 year old engineering student in AFROTC who was put on zoloft about 6 weeks ago due to depression and anxiety. Although I am starting to think that zoloft is not the answer. I feel like I have difficulty concentrating and finding motivation and such because I have low dopamine, not serotonin. 

Thanks for reading and hopefully helping me find myself and understanding myself.
