Any Dean of Students willing to have a quick phone interview?
I am a GA pursuing my M.Ed. in Higher education. I am still a little somewhat lost on where I want my path to take me and am hoping that an interview might help inspire me. Being originally from a very small school, the Dean of Students is a position I know very little about in reality. Are there any Deans in this subreddit that would be willing to talk with me for about 15-30 mins about what you do?
