ANITA: Gus, have you ever been in love?
GUS: Leave.
ANITA: Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
GUS: Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
ANITA: You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
GUS: Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
ANITA: Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
GUS: No Roger from op/ed?
ANITA: Nope.
