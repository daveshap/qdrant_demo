STEVE: You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
SCHLEE: Yes.
STEVE: Was looking at Furtw√§ngler like that?

STEVE: When you got to the crescendo.
STEVE: You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?

STEVE: So, what does the Russki want?
DAVID: Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
STEVE: 'Dim-shits'?

DAVID: They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
