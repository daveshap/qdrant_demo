Working while in a PhD?
I'm a first generation graduate student and don't know how all this works. I've received my funding package and it's not bad. 

I'm just curious about if people hold full or part time jobs while going to school. Do you work during the summer? Where do you/can you get extra funding. 

I'm coming from a ba in philosophy ma in communications. I have a bit of credit debt and two large dogs. I'm kind of worried about not being able to pay my bills.
