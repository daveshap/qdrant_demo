Shout-out to my cat for being the best anti-anxiety med there is
Last night I had a really bad anxiety dream that woke me up so I just grabbed my cat and put him on my chest. There is nothing in this world that will calm me down better than cuddling my cat. Best thing is he seems to enjoy it too 😊

Lately I've been finding time to go home for lunch break during work and I'll just lay down and cuddle or pet him, it's like a reset button on the day. Don't know what I'd do without him!! ♥️
