Need some advice regarding my situation
Since i was 4 years old i have been in this theater  group where my uncle is the founder. I joined because my mom wanted me to.
I enjoyed it for many years, mainly because i have friends there. 
For the last couple of years i have started to dislike it more and more, and realized that it isn't so nice after all.
The leaders there are very strict and if you can't do something right they call you an idiot.
I always feel very depressed there and always try to avoid going there. I've been thinking about quitting but it's really hard, and especially when it has been a part of my life for so long, and my mom still pressures me into going there, while my dad said i can quit if i want to. I'm also very bad at making choices and standing up to people. 
My close friend and cousin also goes there because he is my uncles son. I feel like if i leave he will be very depressed there.
Please if you have any advice i would be very thankful.
Sorry if my English is bad its my fourth language..
