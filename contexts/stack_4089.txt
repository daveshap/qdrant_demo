How do Quebec city bus tickets work? I'm in Quebec city for a while and want to use the bus for trips that involve a transfer each way, so from point A to B I need to catch 2 buses. Obviously I'll need to catch 2 again to return home.I bought an 'Occasionelle' ticket loaded with '12 bil gen', but I'm unsure how it gets depleted, or whether I can use the card as many times as needed over a period of 12 days usage.I'm trying to make sense of it, but the RTC website is extremely unclear in this regard.Thanks!
