ELLEN: My husband tells me you're in sharks.
HOOPER: I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
ELLEN: You love sharks?
HOOPER: I do. But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
BRODY: How come you have to tell them that?
ELLEN: Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
