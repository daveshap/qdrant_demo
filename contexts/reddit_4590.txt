[meta] This sub kinda sucks.
I don't really see the difference between this sub and /r/depression. I unsubscribed from /r/depression because all it does is worsen my mood and give me bad ideas. I thought this sub was going to be more about ways to get better and how to work on improving, but it's a bunch of people talking about how shitty their depression is. And I get that depression sucks, obviously, but honestly one of the worst things for my mental health is reading about how shitty life is. I want to read about cool articles and advice from the community that show me how to feel better. Posts here should be neutral or positive. If you need to rant, go to /r/depression. I Nobody here is able to be your therapist and this sub can't be their replacement. That doesn't belong on a sub with this name. If not /r/depression, then another sub should be made for ranting. 

As this sub is, I can't imagine how this sub could help anyone. There are almost no rules here and no standards for content. I've been subbed for a while but everything here has brought my mood down and ruined my mindset, so I've unsubbed. That doesn't even mention the good hearted laymen who don't really offer useful advice.
