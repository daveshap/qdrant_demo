You know what sucks? (Xpost r/suicidewatch)
I can't kill myself. I could never do that to the people who care about me. I don't want to be alive. I don't want to continue to have to fight through my life trying to find whatever the fuck it is that I'm looking for. I want to just not be here. Either that or I want to be a heroin junkie. Then at least I'd have purpose. Do whatever I have to to secure my next fix. Then maybe one day I would overdose and finally be done with this shit. But no. I can't do either of those things. I have parents who love me to death. How devastated would they be if I killed myself or got addicted to drugs? They would be crushed. I couldn't do that to them. Better me be in pain than them. My friends too. I have two close friends and an amazing girlfriend. They would also be crushed if I ceased to exist. I can't do that to them. Either I hurt or people I love hurt. I guess it just has to be me.
