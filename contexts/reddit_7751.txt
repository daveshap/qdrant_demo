Internship questions for clinical internship/field placement. Advice and thoughts, please!
Hi All, I am a graduate student studying addictions counseling here in NJ. I am set to start my internship in the fall of 2018. My questions are, how did you find your internship/placement site? Did you cold call or send resumes out? Does your school have a list of pre-approved internship sites and if so did they give them to you? Was your school helpful in finding a placement for you? How long before Internship did you start your search? Any advice for a newbie looking to start Internship would be most helpful! Thank You !
