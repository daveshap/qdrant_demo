Hypothesis testing help I need some guidance to the following hypothesis (pardon my poor English and wrong use of technical words)If 75 marbles were drawn \"fairly / blindly\" without replacement from a \"bag\" initially containing exactly 1 million red marbles and exactly 0.1 million black marbles, and 56 of those 75 marbles drawn were black and the remaining were red, then what is the probability (%age) or significance levels (%age) of the hypothesis that that this draw has taken place randomly (without cheating) or alternatively the draw is inconsistent with random selections.To put the problem in perspective, the red marble is worth, say USD 1, and the black marble is worth USD 1,000 in the market. So there is a significant incentive to draw a black marble by cheating. Is there even a 1% chance that this ratio of 56 blacks in 75 draws is honestly done ?
