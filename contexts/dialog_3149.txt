BRUCE: Do you want a drink?
KNOX: Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
BRUCE: Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
VICKI: So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We -- -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
BRUCE: No one would miss me.
VICKI: I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
BRUCE: Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
VICKI: You're one man. You can't save everybody.
BRUCE: What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
VICKI: Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
BRUCE: Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save.
