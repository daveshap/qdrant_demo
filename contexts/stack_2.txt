Question about USB C and DisplayPort I recently purchased a 2017 MacBook Pro 13\" no Touchbar, so I have just 2 USB-C ports available.I've spent literally like 2-3 days looking for the perfect USB-C Dongle (I like the ones that take the 2 ports and turn them into a full range of different ports)But I'm concerned because at home I have a external monitor that doesn't have USB C port, so when I had my old 2012 Macbook I used a mini DisplayPort to Displayport. But, now with this MacBook pro I do not know what to do!I keep reading that in USB-C hubs/dongles, just ONE port charges the Macbook and sends video signal, the other one is just a USB-C port.So, if I purchase a USB-C to Displayport cable to connect to my monitor, I won't be able to charge the MacBook at the same time, right?What can I do? In summary: I need a way to connect my MacBook to my ASUS PB278Q (HDMI is ok also) and at the same time charge the MacBook and be able to have a good USB C hub (in the worst of cases.. one with a cable will do)
