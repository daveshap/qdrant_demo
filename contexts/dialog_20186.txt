LARRY: Kate, you're still there? I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
KATE: You miss me?...
LARRY: Uh, yeah. Sure. Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
KATE: No, why?
LARRY: Well, there's nothing here to eat.
FAITH: Is everything okay?
KATE: Yes. You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
FAITH: But somebody wrote those songs.
KATE: So, what's your point?
FAITH: Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
KATE: No, Faith. They came out of somebody's imagination.
FAITH: I wish you didn't have to go so early.
KATE: Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry. And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
