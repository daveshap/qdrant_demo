JOHN: Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
D. B.: There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe. It's only natural that people—
JOHN: Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
ANN: Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
JOHN: John Doe Clubs? What for?
ANN: Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
JOHN: I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
ANN: Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
JOHN: Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
ANN: Uh-huh . . .
JOHN: Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
ANN: Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
JOHN: Me?
ANN: Uh-huh.
D. B.: Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
JOHN: Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
