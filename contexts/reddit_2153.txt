AOs Can't Actually Detect "Authenticity" Or "Passion": Hot Take From A Stanford Senior
(on a throwaway)

&#x200B;

A week before my freshman year of high school, my (overbearing) Asian parents took me to a private college counselor's office. This person used to be an AO at Stanford, quit her job, and now spends her time coaching students to build the perfect resume to get into super selective colleges.

"So, what do you like to do in your free time?"

"I like hiking and naturery stuff" I said.

"That's not academic enough. Anything else?"

"Uh idk. I like art I guess," I choked.

&#x200B;

After some humming and hawing and lots of googling things on her laptop, my counselor told me that I needed to do something "community-minded" with my interests. "How about starting an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color?" she suggested. **It seemed like she literally just pulled out some "buzzwords" that would look good on my resume,** and I wasn't too interested in the prospect. I stared at her for a solid 30 seconds before my mom said "yes, (my name) would love to do that."

&#x200B;

I remember this moment so clearly because 1. It was the decision to pursue the activity that probably got me into Stanford, and 2. I knew I wasn't interested in it from the very beginning, but I also knew that AOs would never catch my lack of interest. I mean are they mind readers? Of course not. For the record, lots of my supplements (including my Stanford one) talked about how "I was driven to empower students from East San Jose/ Oakland from the beginning of my journey," but clearly, that's not the case. And AOs never noticed, **as both my Stanford and Yale regional AO gave me hand-written, physical notes in my acceptance packages telling me how they "could just feel my enthusiasm for using art as a praxis of empowerment."**

&#x200B;

So yeah, "an art collective for low-income neighborhoods of color"... I emailed a couple local non profits. I started teaching oil painting and creative writing to poor middle schoolers at an after school club. I liked it, but it probably wasn't something I'd pursue on my own without the motivation of college admissions. It got big. *Sophomore year, I got super-competitive grants from 3 well-recognized foundations. Junior year, I got an award from Princeton and another award from a really big non profit recognizing me for my efforts.* **But we all know that I wasn't truly passionate about this.**

&#x200B;

**So what happens after high school graduation?** The kids who run foundations/ non-profits/ programs, at least in my super competitive silicon valley suburb, don't go on to keep up this facade for the rest of their lives (why would they?). Most of the kids in my area, myself included, went on to major in econ/CS and sell our souls out to a giant tech company/ investment bank/ consulting firm after graduation. **Despite our liberal political inclinations, few Stanford students graduate and truly go on to advocate for the communities they supposedly dedicated themselves to in high school.** Sure, there are some exceptions.

&#x200B;

But for the most part, there's a huge campus mentality of "ditching your high school self" and "getting to live a little for the next 4 years" on the Farm because **a good portion of us--especially unhooked applicants like myself--spent almost all of our high school years to get into schools like Stanford.** (There was actually a book written by a Yale professor about this phenomena: Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz. Highly recommend you read the book if you're a senior trying to decide between a selective and a non-selective school atm).

&#x200B;

That's why I'm always confused and angry when AOs and some admissions counselors like u/admissionsmom (I think she's amazing, just wrong on this one aspect) say "just follow your passion" and "we can tell when applicants do ECs they aren't passionate about" or "to get into HPYS, you have to be genuinely interested in what you do;" and the worst one, "be authentic! AOs can tell when you aren't being yourself." **No, they can't.** They can only tell when 1. You're using cliched tropes, and 2. You aren't as successful in your endeavors as you could've been. ***Stanford, and nearly any ultra selective college for that matter, is full of kids who are incredibly successful but not necessarily passionate in what they did in high school.***

&#x200B;

So if any underclassmen are reading this, just remember: **if you're aiming for HYPS, aim for excellence--not necessarily authenticity.** I mean if I spent my high school years doing what I loved the most, I would've spent them hiking, painting (I'm decent at it but not good enough to get Stanford's attention), writing (ditto with painting) and getting high. That most likely wouldn't have led me to Stanford.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: **If you got rejected from your dream schools this week don't feel bad**\--despite what AOs say, they cannot truly determine the emotional investment you've poured into your ECs or academics.
