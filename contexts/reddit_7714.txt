Getting a second Master's degree?
I'm currently a grad student studying economics, my main focus being environmental economics. Ideally, I want a consulting job after I graduate in something related to climate change/sustainability however, I've also been entertaining the idea of either getting a second master's degree in environmental science or something related to sustainability. My question is do you think it's worth the time (studying more when I could just be working) and is it even necessary?
