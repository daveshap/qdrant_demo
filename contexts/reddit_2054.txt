why I'm choosing to go to my safety state school over a T20
This is not clickbait, I promise.

I don't post on here (or reddit) much, but I'm an avid lurker. And like most of you on this sub, I've grinded hard all of high school in hopes of getting into a good college. I have a ton of extracurriculars and awards, mostly to do with theater, on both a state and national level, leadership positions in multiple clubs, 8 APs, 1500+ SAT, a lot of work experience (3 different jobs over the past 2 years, with some overlap), hundreds of volunteer hours, etc.

So, after hearing back from everywhere, I ended up getting into one of my top schools. No one from my hs has gotten in there before, so I was shocked when I got into that T20. Yay! However, after weighing the pros and cons of going there, I've decided to commit with my safety school, and here's why:

1. Cost

I'm in that upper middle class income bracket where while my family is getting by comfortably and can help me pay for college, by no means can they  pay for all of it (nor would I want them to). My top school gave me no merit, and I won't be eligible for much financial aid (if any), so I'd have have to come up with 75k/year to pay for it. While my family would be able to help with some of it, I'd still have to front >$200k+ in loans. My safety school, on the other hand, gave me a full tuition scholarship, so all I have to pay is room & board, so **my entire college education there would cost less than 1 year at my top school.**

2. Fit

**You can't just pick what school you're going to based off of solely rankings.** If you do that, chances are you won't have a good time  (source: many people I know). The T20 has a great program for what I want to do, however, they're not nearly as flexible as the school I'm committed to. I wouldn't be able to do multiple study abroad semesters, and they might not even let me double major because they don't accept a lot of my AP credits. Also, I just don't vibe as much with the people going there. I'm in the honors college of the school I've committed to and the people there seem much more friendly and genuinely authentic than those I've talked to from the T20. This is just my personal experience though, but I know I want to feel like the people around me are real ones and I don't have to weed out as many superficial people that don't care about the people around them

3. Worth

In the field I'm studying, where you go to study for undergrad is not as important as what you do while you're there, and it's just not worth the extra debt. To get the most bang for my buck, I want to save as much money as possible for grad school in case I want to go down that route. **Just because you go to a good undergrad doesn't automatically set you up for complete success in life, it's all about what you make of it.**

In no way am I trying to knock T20s (because they're amazing schools for the most part and if you're going to one, congrats!!), I'm just saying that they're not the best or most feasible choice for everyone, and that it's good to keep an open mind when picking out where you want to spend your next few years and pick the school that's the best fit for you. I'm happy with the choice I've made and am hype to continue the grind the next 4 years! Also, this will probably be my last post on this sub, and I hope that everyone continues (or starts) to THRIVE! If anyone wants any more specific details about how I went about anything, feel free to PM me! Thanks to everyone on this sub for making this community a hilariously informative place.

EDIT: thank you all for the overwhelmingly positive responses! many people have asked so i shall tell- the schools are USC (if that's technically not T20 and just T25 i'm sorry my b but like ok whatever same point) and Temple (go owls!!). And if you have any other random questions, feel free to PM me because I'm in a very unusual situation as a poli sci/theatre double major!
