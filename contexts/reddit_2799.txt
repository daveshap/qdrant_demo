Being Honest in Exit Interview - Is It Ever Appropriate?
Interested to read everyone's thoughts on this. I've always read and heard that you should never be honest in the exit interview, never give feedback, they don't deserve it, etc etc.

My question to the group is, is there ever situations where it may actually be of some benefit to the company you're leaving?

I've got a potential job offer coming up. I've asked for a raise at my current company, citing numerous sources of data suggesting that it's a fair argument. The response is "we don't have it in the budget this year, CEO wouldn't go for it, etc". Other employees have told me that they have received the same response. But magically, when someone gets a job offer paying more, my current company matches it.

It's a situation where I enjoy my boss and the company. Just not their old school approach to compensation. Even if they matched my potential offer, I won't take it. I'm not mad at them and there's no ill will.

I'm confident that I could say this in an exit interview without burning bridges. We have a good enough relationship for that.

My thought is, is it such a bad thing that I call my current company on this? Yes, they may not change. But they sure as hell won't if no one says anything about it and just smiles and gives the "It's just an opportunity I can't turn down" answer. If I could potentially open the door for someone else to get a raise in result of me leaving, to me that's a win.

What say ye? Let's discuss.

Edit: When I say "being honest" I'm not implying that anyone go in and lash out, be emotional, unprofessional, and offensive. More-so the opposite. Professional with courtesy and tact.
