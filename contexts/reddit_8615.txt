Does it matter in an obstruction of justice case whether or not President Donald Trump actually succeeded in firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller?
According to this [New York Times 'bombshell' report](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html), Trump ordered the firing of Robert Mueller. It states that the only reason Robert Mueller and his investigation exist still is because Trump's White House Counsel refused to carry out Trump's order. Trump then backed off when the White House Counsel threatened to quit in response.

On Fox News, and specifically [Fox and Friends this morning](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/26/trump-slams-report-claiming-sought-to-fire-mueller-blames-fake-news.html), some hosts have argued that this act does not matter because Trump didn't end up firing Mueller in the end, so the report is a non-starter. It would only have been obstruction had the order been followed to completion. 

Other pro-Trump arguments [(same Fox News article with quote at 1:45 in video)](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/26/trump-slams-report-claiming-sought-to-fire-mueller-blames-fake-news.html) include that Trump backed off of the firing after being given proper guidance by his Counsel -- albeit guidance in the form of a threat. But nonetheless, Trump let the investigation continue once he was given more information regarding the matter.

My question, in the title, is something that is being hotly debated on every single news channel and in every debate circle. Does obstruction of justice need the actual act carried out to completion? Is the case of obstruction of justice less weighty considering the fact that Trump didn't pursue the firing after White House Counsel threatened to resign? Does Trump now have a better case *against* obstruction of justice seeing as he changed his mind on firing Mueller and let it continue unobstructed?
