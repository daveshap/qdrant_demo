GUS: Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
JOSIE: It is hoped that it's not a mess. Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy
JOSIE: Well, excuse me for caring about words.
GUS: So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
ANITA: Oh, man! Who told?
GUS: Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
JOSIE: Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
ANITA: And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
GUS: How many times have I fired her?
JOSIE: Five-- Six--
GUS: Eh.
JOSIE: Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
GUS: Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
JOSIE: Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
GUS: Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
JOSIE: You've done five of my ideas.
GUS: You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
JOSIE: They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
GUS: A flack jacket.
JOSIE: A--flack jacket.
GUS: Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
JOSIE: You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
GUS: Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
JOSIE: Hey--I can be out of control.
