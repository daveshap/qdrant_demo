JIM: So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
MICHELLE: Yes! And he was such a dork! And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care? Because it was so funny!
JIM: Okay, I get it.
MICHELLE: Oh! And then this one time? At band camp? I stuck a flute in my pussy.
JIM: ...excuse me?!
MICHELLE: What, you think I don't know how to get myself off? Hell, that's what half of band camp is! Sex ed!
JIM: This'll do.
MICHELLE: Now, I have two rubbers. Wear them both, it'll desensitize you. I don't want you coming so damn early.
JIM: Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
MICHELLE: Come on. I saw you on the net. Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!

STIFLER'S MOM: Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
FINCH: Yes ma'am, I am.
STIFLER'S MOM: I had no idea you'd be this good!
FINCH: Neither did I!
JIM: Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
MICHELLE: Don't you want me to?
JIM: Oh yeah! Put it in your mouth!
MICHELLE: Okay!
