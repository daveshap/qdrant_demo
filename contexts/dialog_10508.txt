CHILI: I wouldn't think you're that dumb, leave over three hundred grand in the closet, underneath the extra blanket, but I guess you are.
LEO: I didn't know where else to keep it. Where would you?
CHILI: You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
LEO: They report it to the IRS.
CHILI: You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
CHILI: You've been losing.
LEO: I'm up twelve grand today.
CHILI: From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
LEO: Who told you that?
CHILI: Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
LEO: How'd you know I was here?
CHILI: Here's another tip...
LEO: It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
CHILI: I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
LEO: How? By taking my money?
CHILI: You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
LEO: It's all mine.
CHILI: Sit down, Leo.
