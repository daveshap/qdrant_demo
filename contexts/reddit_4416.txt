Feeling like you’ve wasted your life
This is a rough one for me to post. I’m 28 years old, living someplace that many others consider the Most Magical Place on Earth. I never finished college, have been used and abused by man after man and continue working my dead end job barely making ends meet. 

Constantly, day after day I scroll social media and am constantly reminded just how little I’ve done with my life. 

When I moved away from my hometown five years ago I was on top of the world, but since then I’ve been on a rollercoaster downward spiral without knowing where to turn to for help or advice. 

From contracting HIV in an unfortunate encounter, to being cheated on and lied to by the man I thought I would spend the rest of my life with things just haven’t gotten easier. 

Each and every time I think things are looking up, another issue comes to slap me on down.

It’s to the point now where I can’t even get out of bed some days to even attempt to address these issues. 

I never imagined when I left my hometown that I would have ruined my life and have nothing to live for or show for my years of independence. 

I just hate feeling this way and don’t know what to do anymore.
