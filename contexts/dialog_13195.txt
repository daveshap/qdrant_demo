JOEY: What?
TERRI: Your dream. You said you were having a bad dream.
JOEY: Oh yeah ...
JOEY: ... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything. It's ... well, I know what it is.
TERRI: What is it?
JOEY: Why are you so interested?
TERRI: Sorry.
JOEY: No. No, it's OK. I ... It's my father.
TERRI: Oh, right. Did he used to ... ?
JOEY: God, no! Nothing like that. No, he died before I was born. He died in Vietnam. I never knew him. Never met him. We don't even know the details. I dream of battlefields. Of searching. Of trying to find out.
TERRI: That's great.
JOEY: What?
TERRI: No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything. It's just I don't dream. Never have. ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams. I'm jealous. It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
JOEY: I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream? No, you know, you do. You must. What you mean is you don't remember them.
