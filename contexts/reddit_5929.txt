Worth staying a 5th year in college?

First-generation college student here, and I'm lost as heck.

I started college off as a Computer Science major at UC Irvine; I applied to the major since I've always been mathematically inclined and had messed with Code Academy but I didn't really know what I wanted to do, nor had I ever taken any CS classes. It kicked my a— my 1st year of college, and I had never felt worse: I only passed the first introductory course and failed the next class. I coasted until my Junior year by taking GE classes and not focusing on any upper divs.

Fast forward, my counselor decided it was best for me to switch into Sociology if I still wanted to graduate with a different major on time. Me being me, I followed her advice since I figured she would know more than me.

Now as a senior in college, the sociology classes that I am taking are okay—they're interesting—but I don't know what type of job I could get out of college? I haven't considered graduate school for Sociology because I'm not too fond of the major.

As I stated, I love math, but after coming to college, I feel like I am not as smart as I thought I was in high school. I was thinking about switching into Business Economics since I've taken a good amount of Econ courses which I enjoyed, and I've passed all of the math classes required for the major already.

Given that, I would have to stay a 5th year in college to get my BA degree in Business Economics. Is it worth staying if my 5th year is covered by FAFSA? Could I get a business job with a Sociology degree?

Edit: I would not have to take out loans for a 5th year
