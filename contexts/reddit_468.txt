My self worth is shit
Hi,My name is xxx.
Lately,I've been feeling really worthless even though my friends and family keep complimenting me.Why do I feel like they're just saying this because they feel bad for me? Why do I constantly deny compliments towards me? Is it just teenage angst or what? My self confidence has plummeted down to the point where I just question everything I do.I've tried talking to adults about this but they all just keep saying the same thing over and over again. "Have some confidence in yourself,you're great." and then they change the subject.I'm trying my hardest to have pride in everything I do but the thoughts in my head keep piling up and I just-- I don't know what to do with myself anymore.Everytime I make a mistake I constantly judge myself until I just break down.I'm also in constant paranoia that everybody secretly hates me and hopes that I die in a ditch or something.
