NUKE: What?
ANNIE: They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
NUKE: Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
ANNIE: You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain. These'll help move things to the right side.
NUKE: Big League pitchers don't use these.
ANNIE: They did when they were in the Carolina League.
