TRENT: ...Well, you know, not counting the first table.
MIKE: Thanks for clarifying that.
TRENT: Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
MIKE: Yea, how much?
TRENT: I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
MIKE: Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
TRENT: Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
MIKE: You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
TRENT: Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
MIKE: Let's just leave.
TRENT: Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
MIKE: Let's go.
TRENT: Who's the big winner?
TRENT: Mikey's the big winner.
MIKE: What an asshole.
TRENT: Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
WAITRESS: There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
MIKE: Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
CHRISTY: A couple of high rollers like you?
MIKE: Could you believe it?
CHRISTY: Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
MIKE: Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
CHRISTY: Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
MIKE: No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
