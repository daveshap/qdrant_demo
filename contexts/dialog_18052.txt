NYAH: No. Should I?
ETHAN: No. You just looked as if you did.
NYAH: No. Just as if I'd like to.
ETHAN: Oh. Well. I think that can be arranged.
NYAH: Not tonight. Bad timing. Sorry -
ETHAN: There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
NYAH: Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
ETHAN: What if I pay the rent?
NYAH: Uh-huh.
ETHAN: Uh-huh?
