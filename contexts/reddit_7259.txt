Trade school or academia?
Hi guys i'm 28 and torn,
I have done a few years at a university switching majors around until eventually i settled on Psychology. I did enjoy it quite a bit, I don't know if I see myself as a therapist, but I've been told by many friends I could be successful as one. I realized what interests me the most is the Neuroscience field. I've been on hiatus from a university for about 4 years now and have been working since.

I worked as a restaurant line cook and even did a year of a culinary program at one point because I thought I enjoyed cooking enough to really learn as much as I could. I realized though, I no longer want to work in the restaurant industry. 

I currently work in the manufacturing field. I've wanted to explore jobs that are more hands-on just to earn a solid paycheck and maintain hobbies outside of work. Recently, I've been turned on by the idea of trade school. I know that renewable energy jobs will be on the rise in the future and i've considered going to an electrical program to learn about renewable energy. Renewable energy is something I've always felt inspired by ever since HS.

Being a morning person has always been a struggle for me (unless I retrain myself to do so), and I realize that a lot of trade jobs start work at the crack of dawn. 

As far as the Neuroscience field I could see myself being a researcher, maybe getting an M.S to become a Neurologist. There's a lot of really cool things Id like to continue learning about in the field of Neuroscience and Psychology. Id probably enroll in a community college to bring my GPA up so that I can get into the best state school here.

So thats my story, id appreciate anyones input.
