RICKY: Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
BOBBY: Easy...
WELSHMAN: Hey, boys.
BOBBY: Tom. How's it going?
WELSHMAN: Fine, fine. And you were...?
BOBBY: Bobby and Ricky.
WELSHMAN: Right, right. The 'thugs.'
WELSHMAN: And where is...?
HORRACE: Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
WELSHMAN: No?
HORRACE: Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
WELSHMAN: Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
HORRACE: Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
WELSHMAN: Pity. What's say we have a drink?
