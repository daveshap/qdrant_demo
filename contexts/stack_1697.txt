What does the current distribution look like on an antenna? This is more of a conceptual question, but I am struggling with understanding the current distribution on a radiating antenna. I understand how it travels, but how do we know? Is there some paper or textbook I could read that proves where the current is on a radiating antenna?Reason I am asking is because maxwell's equations include a current distribution term that I am curious about.
