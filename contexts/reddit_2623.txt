Any graduate still applying for jobs/finding it hard to get a job?
I'm working on an online series/doing some research for a media company atm. I'm trying to find a graduate (who left uni 1-3 years ago) who hasn't been able to get a job in their chosen field. It would ideally be someone who's applied for lots of jobs but hasn't been able to get one in the area they want yet. (This is for a non creative job role so could include but not limited to business, medicine, science, accounting etc) 

 It personally took me a while after I graduated to follow a career path so I feel like I know the struggle.

Is there anyone from the UK who wouldn't mind speaking to me in more detail?
