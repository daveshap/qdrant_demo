MARROW: Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing. Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
MALCOLM: And that will be a good place to end this study.
MARROW: No, Malcolm! Individual performance is only part of it. I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
MALCOLM: Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
MARROW: But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results. The deception is minor.
MALCOLM: Are you working with her?
MARROW: Mary, I'll meet you outside.
MALCOLM: Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
MARROW: And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
MALCOLM: You don't believe in the paranormal.
MARROW: No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
MALCOLM: Does she know that's why you're using her?
MARROW: No.
MALCOLM: I, I just can't...
MARROW: She needed a job, Malcolm. And she's smart. And she helps me.
MALCOLM: I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
MARROW: This is the last chapter. Please, please give me clearance. It's for science.
