Has the economy improved or worsened in the last eight years, and how much of the blame/credit for that can go to Obama's administration?
I hear a lot of people asking if we're better or worse than you were 8 years ago. Personally, I'm way better, so I'll be biased. I'm wondering if things have actually improved [like the left says](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/improving-economy-could-boost-democrats-2016), or if we're [weaker as the right claims](http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/05/31/economist-dont-believe-obama-clinton-economic-spin-todays-america-is-no-paradise.html).
