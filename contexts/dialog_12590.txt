DICK: Are you all right?
ROB: Yeah. I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up. She's gone. And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
DICK: 'Course I will, Rob. No problem. No problem at all. I'll tell him next time I see him.
DICK: I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
ROB: Fine.
DICK: I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously. Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle playing at Lounge Ax tonight. I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good. So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.
DICK: Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight. I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that. And he likes you. It's just that --
ROB: I understand, Dick.
DICK: Sure. 'Course. Rob, look. Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
