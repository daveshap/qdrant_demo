MR. NORTH: You're one of William's kids, huh?
TAUPIN: His only kid.
MR. NORTH: Sure take after him. Never seen a father and son look more alike.
TAUPIN: We were very close.
MR. NORTH: The resemblance is amazing.
TAUPIN: When may I expect the cleaners?
MR. NORTH: I'll send them right up.
MAN: That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
BRENNA: There was a Count. Count Dusan. He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it. The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
MAN: You're very macabre.
BRENNA: It's my birthday.
MAN: Happy birthday.
BRENNA: Thanks.
