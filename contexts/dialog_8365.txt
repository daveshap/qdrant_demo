ERIK: Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
HELGA: You don't love ME.
ERIK: No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
HELGA: What -- rape?
ERIK: No. It isn't rape then, is it?
HELGA: Oh, get it over with.
ERIK: I don't suppose... no...
HELGA: What?
ERIK: I don't suppose you... you DO like me at all?
HELGA: What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
ERIK: I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
HELGA: About raping me?
ERIK: About NOT raping you...
HELGA: You DON'T like it, do you?
ERIK: Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
HELGA: What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
ERIK: Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
HELGA: Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
ERIK: To pay for the next expedition, of course.
HELGA: But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
ERIK: Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
HELGA: Well you started it.
ERIK: I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
HELGA: And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
ERIK: Scream.
HELGA: Ah.
ERIK: Louder.
HELGA: Aaagh! Rape!
ERIK: Oh, thanks.
