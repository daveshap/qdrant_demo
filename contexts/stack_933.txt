Is it possible to use the Greek keyboard layout in Scribus? I typically have my keyboard set up to use multiple alphabets, toggling with alt+shift; I use American English and Greek most frequently, followed by occasionally Japanese with Anthy, and occasionally Cyrillic. It works very well in almost every program.However, Scribus, which is otherwise very decent layout software, refuses to recognize Greek. I really need that \u03bb! Am I missing a package, or is there something else I need to do? The space isn't even filled with a filler character, it just remains blank.This alphabet is awfully important to engineers, so I would be very surprised if there was no solution.Update: I have determine that the \u03c0 key consistently works fine, apparently on all fonts; but even on Neohellenic, it is the only one. Is something weird going on with font processing?I have now attempted this on two completely physically separate machines, with different hardware, and gotten the same result. I typically use alt+shift to switch layouts, via Mint 19's keyboard manager. Doing so works on literally every other program I've tried, on both machines. However, Scribus, on both machines, ceases accepting input until I switch back to en mode. In gr, the only key that works is \u03c0; all others have no effect.Symbol insertion works reasonably well, but this is a non-solution if I'm to attempt to type anything in the Hellenic alphabet.
