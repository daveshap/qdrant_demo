LOUISE: Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open! We're fugitives now. Let's behave that way!
THELMA: You're right.
THELMA: Louise? Where are we?
LOUISE: Just past Boise City.
THELMA: Idaho?
LOUISE: Oklahoma, Thelma. We're crossing into New Mexico.
THELMA: I always wanted to see New Mexico.
THELMA: Now what?
LOUISE: Now what what?
THELMA: Whaddo we do?
LOUISE: Oh, I don't know, Thelma. I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays. Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
THELMA: I'm not suggestin' that! I'm not goin' back. No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
THELMA: Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
LOUISE: Yeah.
THELMA: Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
LOUISE: You mean now or before?
THELMA: Before.
LOUISE: I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
THELMA: What little dogs?
LOUISE: You know those little dogs you see people with?
THELMA: Like a Chihuahua?
LOUISE: Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones? Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
THELMA: Oh yeah. You mean Peek-a-poos.
LOUISE: Yeah. Those. That always put the fear of God in me. What about you?
THELMA: Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
LOUISE: I can see that.
THELMA: I mean, look how different he looks just since high school. It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse. I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
LOUISE: Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
THELMA: Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
THELMA: This is so beautiful.
LOUISE: Gosh. It sure is.
THELMA: I always wanted to travel. I just never got the opportunity.
LOUISE: Well, you got it now.
LOUISE: Look! Look who it is, Thelma. I'll be darned. What's he doin' way out here.
THELMA: Just ignore him.
LOUISE: Oh, Christ. I hate this guy.
THELMA: We should have just ignored him.
LOUISE: What?
THELMA: Nothing. It's not funny.
LOUISE: What? What's not funny, Thelma!
