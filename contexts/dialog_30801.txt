ROWAN: I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.

MICHAEL: I don't remember you at all- You - you saved my life- Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
ROWAN: I'm glad you're around to say it.
MICHAEL: My jury's still out on that,
ROWAN: Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative. I'm in the life business - remember..?
