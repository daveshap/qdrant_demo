Grad School, good gpa, good portfolio, but a low Credit Score
So yeah I know it might be similar questions asked but with my situation is a little bit different (or the same.) I am planning on applying for the Savvanh College of art and Design for Winter 2019. With everything in check, I would have a 3.3-3.5 when I graduate from ungrad school in the Fall, and my portfolio will be a strong one (hoping it is) to submit, however while reading up on other things, one requirement is to fill out the Fafsa form with a positive credit score.  So far now, my credit score is a 555. It has gotten that low because of a situation back in January 2013 where I applied for phone services along with a parent under altell. What i didn't fail to realize is that that parent was going to dissapear. What made the situation worse is that he ranned the bill from 80 to 200. Unable to pay it (since we did not have access to the account information.) I found out a couple of years later that altell closed and was bought by AT-T which now said I owed 515 USD. Without a stable job and my stupid self thinking that he will pay it (which he winded up not doing) My credit score took a hit. However two years ago, I opened an account with Verizon and made monthly payments up now, not missing a single one. I checked my credit score a couple of weeks ago and the only negative thing on my balance is from that and the loans I borrowed from my current college that was waived.  Since I am applying to SCAD should I be worried about not being able to get the loans to pay for these classes?  I read somewhere that I might have a chance to pull loans from a grad school if my credit wasn't adverse (Not exceeding 2,048 dollars). Another thing I read that I could put in an appeal to explain that a situation for the bad credit wouldn't more likely to occur again. 
I am not sure how entirely true it is but I wanted to see if I still have the chance of getting what I need for SCAD?
