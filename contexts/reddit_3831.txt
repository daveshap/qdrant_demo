No ghosting pact
Can we all agree that ghosting sucks? I think it’s terrible and I would rather have someone tell me straight to my face that I suck. 

If you all are interested in trying to end ghosting (a ridiculous concept) then let’s all agree to not do it anymore. 

The only reasons it’s acceptable to ghost (feel free to add) 

1. Fear of safety
2. Person treated you terribly 
3. Abusive
4. You never met (debatable/ should I remove this one)


If the other person was decent and you just weren’t feeling it. Just be straight up and say it! 

On flip side if they end it with you, don’t be nasty and move on. 


Deal?
