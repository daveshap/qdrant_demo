In a unique position with my current job where I realistically will only work one week every month. What are some other jobs/sources of income I can do with the other three weeks?
I currently live in Houston and the company I work for is HQ’d in another city. I drive up there two weeks out of the month and work, but I’m transitioning to one week per month by June or July. I manage the software that drives our entire company process along with all of our IT services. I also go on sales calls and manage and train employees.

Now I don’t have any coding experience; I worked for the company that provides our software. I did the implementation for all of their customers. I’m also only in my twenties, so I don’t have very many years of experience.

I was hoping to get some advice on what else I could do with the downtime I have. I really only take a few short calls a week and deal with some software issues here and there.
