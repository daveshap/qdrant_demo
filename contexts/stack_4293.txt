What drive/engine would allow Medrunners to make it to Venus from Oberon in one to two weeks Medrunner Lao Dorn and his team have been given a mission. A young woman has contracted some sort of parasite that is slowly eating away at her vital organs. The doctors on Oberon are unable to do much to help her and have decided to put her into cryosleep to delay the parasite. They have contact a medrunner to ship her to a place where the doctors would know how to treat a case like this: Venus.Due to the nature of cryosleep (in universe), emergency freezing is dangerous and at times fatal if patients are kept frozen for more then a few weeks at the most (even then, it's risky). Because of this, Lao only has a few weeks to make it to Venus before risking the death of his patient.What kind of propulsion device would allow Lao's craft to reach Venus from Oberon in approximately 1-2 weeks real time (not Lao's possibly dilated time)?Note: Fusion power is availableMedrunners are publicly funded so expense isn't an issue unless it's ridiculousOberon is one of the major moons of UranusThe distance between Oberon and Venus would be approximately 18.5 AU
