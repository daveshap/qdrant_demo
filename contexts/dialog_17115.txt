GRAHAM: Hello.
MOLLY: I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
GRAHAM: Mama was probably asleep.
MOLLY: Will? Are you okay?
GRAHAM: Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer. I want to see you.
MOLLY: I want to see you, too.
GRAHAM: Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
MOLLY: Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
GRAHAM: Come home with me.
MOLLY: Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
GRAHAM: What's this Mama shit?
MOLLY: It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
GRAHAM: What's the problem, Molly?
MOLLY: I came up here after Kevin's father died. They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
GRAHAM: Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
MOLLY: Will? You could come up here.
GRAHAM: They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you. But they don't want to see me...
MOLLY: That's not true.
GRAHAM: Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
MOLLY: Maybe we should give it some time...
GRAHAM: Yeah. That's great. A little time. I tell you what, buckaroo... See you around.
