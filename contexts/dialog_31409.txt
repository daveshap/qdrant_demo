SARA: Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
GRADY: Really, Sara, I...
SARA: I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
GRADY: I know that. I know what's at stake here...
SARA: No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
GRADY: About the baby.
SARA: That... and you.
