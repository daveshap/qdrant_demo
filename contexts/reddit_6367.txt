Where are the Jobs at?
OK guy's here is the deal.  I have been laid off for a month and a half now and that went by quick as hell.  I have been applying for at least 10 jobs a day.  I was with a company for 8 years and worked my way up the chain and was making a decent 40K a year.  They laid me off out of nowhere and I am lost.  In those 10 jobs a day (which equates to about 500 jobs at this point) I have had 1 interview.  That's right 1.  Of course I didn't get the job.  I have no trade skills and I have 2 semesters until I finish my associates degree.  The only thing I am qualified for is minimum wage retail jobs or slightly above minimum wage security jobs.  I feel like a loser.  My question is this.  I am a single guy in his 30's and have nothing tying me down.  I live in Colorado and can not get a job to save my life.  If I wait out my unemployment benefits (4 1/2 months to go) I might be homeless.  I have no one to go to so this sucks.  I am willing to sell all my stuff and start fresh somewhere.  So where should I look?  Where are there the most job openings that pay decent.  I mean at least $12 or $13 an hour.  I mean, that's not to much to ask is it.  Should I look to the East Coast or the West?  I would seriously go anywhere until I can hammer out school. I want to leave while I still have income from unemployment.  You know, before I become completely homeless and lost.   Any advice would be great.
