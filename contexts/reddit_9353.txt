So I need a new "comforter," but have no money. My solution.
NOTE: Thank you for the overwhelming amount of generous offers to buy me a blanket or comforter and send me fabric, but I'm fine. I have other blankets. You're all wonderful, but you're missing the point of my post. I'm making a duvet cover, not "patching together a blanket," and patchwork quilting is a classic art that I was taught by my grandmother. I don't want to sew it on a machine. I want to do this the way my grandmother and mother taught me.  

ORIGINAL POST:
I'm decluttering, and in one box I found a bunch of fabric, including half a roll of muslin I had forgotten I had. There isn't enough fabric of one kind to make a twin-sized duvet cover, but if I make a big-square patchwork quilt, there will be enough. There is enough muslin to make a back for it, and I have an old sheet I can use to back the quilted part, since it won't be showing.

The stuffing on the comforter I have is still fine, but the outside is pilled and worn. I got it as a gift from my deceased mom, so I hesitate to just get rid of it. This way, I don't have to. I can just make a nice duvet cover and still have my comforter with a bright, pretty new washable cover.

The most it will cost me is for the thread. I don't have a sewing machine, so this will all be hand-sewn during down times when I'm watching tv or relaxing.
