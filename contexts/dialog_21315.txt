MATTHEW: Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
JAMES: She said that?
MATTHEW: You weren't really interested in Suez at all. Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.
JAMES: Now listen...
MATTHEW: No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea. Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years. And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London. I'm not telling you how to run your affairs. I'm just saying ... I don't mind. I'm giving you permission.
JEREMY: Still in love?
JAMES: I'm not sure.
JEREMY: Darling Susan. You look like an angel. But where's your hat?
SUSAN: Oh no!
JEREMY: They won't let you in without one.
