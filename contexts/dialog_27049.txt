ELAINE: When did you get in?
WILSON: Yesterday. Afternoon.
ELAINE: You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
WILSON: No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know. Getting a car sorted ...
ELAINE: I might've been away for the weekend.
WILSON: Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
ELAINE: And you've seen Eddie Rama.
WILSON: Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah. Me and him are muckers.
ELAINE: I should really give him a call. He's a character, isn't he. Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
WILSON: He give me your address.
ELAINE: I gave him yours. Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative. I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny. Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
WILSON: Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life. On her own after her mum died. Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
ELAINE: Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
WILSON: Nah, we split up when Jenny was six. Her second husband done a runner after she got sick. They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital. We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum. I like to think they're together again now. Y'know. Heavenly choir.
ELAINE: The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
WILSON: Nah, accommodation address.
ELAINE: What's that, like a P.O. box.
WILSON: Something like that, yeah.
ELAINE: Where you get your bank statements.
