This may be really selfish but it's my opinion
I've seen lots of people saying that if you die, the people around will be sad and angry at themselves etc.

 But the thing is: if I'm dead, I can't "see" or "experience" the repercussions of my death and I think I prefer that to feel like shit all the time. I know this is a awful way of thinking.
So yeah, I'm probably only still alive cause I dont have the courage to do anything.


P.S. English isn't my first language so please excuse any mistakes
