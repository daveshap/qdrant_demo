I have to go to a meeting in about an hour and 1/2. 2 of my managers will be there and I'm at my wits end as it is...
One of them decided to send me an email asking about an assignment I haven't finished with the other copied on it, making it look like I don't do shit (ironic I'm on reddit right now, I know)

I hate the asinine projects they give me that would have never been a problem in the first place had they given it half a thought when creating the product. I hate almost every aspect of my job with every fiber of my being and have been on the edge of quitting for months.

I can't afford to quit, but I'm afraid if one or both of them reprimands me, I may say something I will regret.(Even if it's true)
