ROCCO: This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
MURPHY: Hallelujah, Jaffar.
ROCCO: So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
ROCCO: Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
MURPHY: We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open.
