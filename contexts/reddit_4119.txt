Is it really that bad to try dating while you’re picking yourself back together?
I was reading a couple of posts and sure enough, it always leads to someone going down someone’s post history to tell them why their life is fucked and they need to improve it before dating. It comes off hella judgmental and in some cases, they don’t even answer what the post is asking

I get the idea of working on yourself to improve your chances of dating and an healthier more independent mindset but I don’t understand why abstinence from dating or even seeking out a partner, friend, activity partner, FWB or whatever is so necessary for that. Humans are social creatures and someone is feeling lonely and wants some kind of social interaction then it’s completely understandable that they’d want to get advice on how to get that.

I just feel like these “just wait until you get better” kind of responses are a bit r/wowthanksimcured and are not too helpful.
