Working remotely due to pandemic, should I tell my boss I took a trip to another state?
So since the pandemic started my entire company has been working from home. Since there’s no date on when we would return to work, I’ve taken a trip to another state to spend some time with my family. Although there is a time difference, I work the same hours to match my company work hours. I haven’t told my boss about my trip as it doesn’t affect my work and since we’re all remote and I’m working the same hours, I don’t think it matters. I do intend on traveling back home as soon as we have a concrete date to return to office.


Thing is, he recently  ordered a new work laptop for me and suggested maybe meeting up for coffee while I go pick up the laptop. 

So my question is should I just tell him I’m currently in another state? Would that be awkward since I’m only mentioning it now after he suggested coffee? Or should I not tell him and find excuses to not get coffee and delay my new laptop pickup. Advice appreciated. Thank you.

UPDATE: Thank you all for the comments and advice. Decided to tell my boss this morning. He was super understanding and made no big deal of it. Just wanted to make sure of the date I would return.
