Currently in hospital
Jumped of my house’s roof and ended up with a broken hip, arm and leg and a broken skull and needed surgery, DONT DO IT IS NOT WORTH IT.
I’m very homesick right and I’m going inpatient to the psych ward soon. Life is shit but we all gotta keep fighting.
Edit: my house is not two story but three.
