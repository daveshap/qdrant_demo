What to tell my mom
Hey, guys my mom has been telling me to clean my room but I haven’t had time, I have to manage college class and high school class while doing student council while doing a compound for class! While trying to loose weight. She doesn’t understand since she didn’t go to school. How can I approach to her 
PS: I’m writing this from tutoring!
