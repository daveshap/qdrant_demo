GIBBS: Say again?
JACK: I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
GIBBS: Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
JACK: Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew.
GIBBS: A fool's errand.
JACK: Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants. Something he needs.
GIBBS: And you've got that, have you?
