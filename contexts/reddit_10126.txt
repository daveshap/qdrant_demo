I feel as though some of my rights were violated by my school. Where can I seek answers to my questions?
As the title indicates, I feel as though the school that I attend violated some very basic rights, namely, my right to privacy.

Can anyone suggest a sub that I can share my issue, so I may understand what options I have for resolution?
I feel like a doormat that anyone can walk all over without any fear of repercussion and it makes me feel very small and weak when all I ever intended was to go to school, work hard and earn a degree.

Thanks so much.
