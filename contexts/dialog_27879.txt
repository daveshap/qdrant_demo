TESSIO: Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
MICHAEL: He talked to you?
TESSIO: I can arrange security.
MICHAEL: Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him. I really needed him.
HAGEN: Did he give you his politicians?
MICHAEL: Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all. I guess you've figured it all out?
HAGEN: How will they come at you?
MICHAEL: I know now. I'll make them call me Don.
HAGEN: Have you agreed on a meeting?
MICHAEL: A week from tonight. In Brooklyn on Tessio's ground, where I'll be safe.
