Diplomatic, but in a casual setting I\u2019m looking for a word that is synonymous with diplomatic, but in an environment that is more casual. You will use this word to describe a person who returns phatic responses in inane conversations, so as to avoid being subjected to direct questions, but otherwise have no interest in participating in it.I\u2019m not looking for the word \u201cpolite\u201d but do let me know if I\u2019m wrong. (I\u2019m not looking for the word \u201crude\u201d either.)
