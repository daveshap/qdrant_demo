Hello I need a reason to wake up tommorow
Yep, thats all. Im a uni student under coronavirus lockdown, alone in an apartment. Lately I have been sleeping through days because I cant bring myself to wake up, especially since there is nowhere to go and only class work to do. 

Leaving this post here so I wake up to check it tomorrow. 

You can comment anything, ask me something if you want. Im a Business undergrad student. I have lived in the USA UK Azerbaijan and Angola. Im an introvert and have social anxiety. Uh.. thats pretty much it. Also I want to write a book someday (who doesn't?).
