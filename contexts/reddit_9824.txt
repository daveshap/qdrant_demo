When to follow up on a search process?
Hey everyone,

I'm looking for advice on when or how to best follow up on a search. I had a second round interview about two weeks ago. The interviewers shared after being asked that next steps for successful candidates were a reference check and an invitation to campus. One of my references was kind enough to let me know they were contacted at the end of last week to set up a reference check, but I still haven't heard anything from the institution themselves. I've still been applying to positions but this is a job I'm very excited about and want to make sure I show I'm interested and excited without dropping off the radar or seeming over eager. Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated!
