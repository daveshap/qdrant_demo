QGIS Issue with 3D view altitude binding I'm running into an issue with the 3D view in QGIS.I have a DEM, which is displaying correctly and a building footprints polygon layer from OSM. It is draping correctly as a 2d polygon on the DEM in the 3D view, but when I go into the 3D View settings and enable 3D view rendering for the buildings layer to 'extrude' them, the 3D polygons are displaying far above the DEM vertically. I have switched the Altitude Binding to Terrain, which I believe should adhere them to the DEM since I have the DEM defined as the terrain in the 3D view, but nothing changes.
