Is Israel an apartheid state?
On March 15, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia released a report [declaring that "Israel is a racial State that has established an apartheid regime."](https://www.unescwa.org/news/escwa-launches-report-israeli-practices-towards-palestinian-people-and-question-apartheid) Jimmy Carter has also compared the situation in Israel to apartheid in South Africa in his book **Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid**, which describes, as Carter put it, ["...the abominable oppression and persecution in the occupied Palestinian territories, with a rigid system of required passes and strict segregation between Palestine's citizens and Jewish settlers in the West Bank... In many ways, this is more oppressive than what black people lived under in South Africa during apartheid."](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/dec/12/israel.politicsphilosophyandsociety) Others have also declared that the term 'apartheid' [fits Israel.](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-makdisi-israel-apartheid-20140518-story.html) The Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement, which ["works to end international support for Israel's oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law,"](https://bdsmovement.net/) holds a yearly [Israeli Apartheid Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Apartheid_Week) "to educate people about the nature of Israel as an apartheid system." 

The idea of Israel as an apartheid state, or as a racial state that has established an apartheid regime, is disputed. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres immediately distanced himself from the ESCWA report and then asked that [ESCWA's report be withdrawn and taken off the web](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-israel-report-idUSKBN16O1WB).  

Richard J. Goldstone, a South African former judge who is called a ['hero of the anti-apartheid left,'](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/05/richard-goldstone-judge-gaza-report) wrote that using the word apartheid to describe Israel is ["an unfair and inaccurate slander against Israel, calculated to retard rather than advance peace negotiations."](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/opinion/israel-and-the-apartheid-slander.html)  

Does the analogy and/or label of 'apartheid' apply to Israel?
