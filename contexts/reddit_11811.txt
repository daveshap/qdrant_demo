Bad in school, gaming addicted and a crush on a girl.
Hi!

I'm just really down. In school we have now halftime of the year, and we get something like a school report. And, how should it else be, i'm negative in one subject. You will think now:"Wow, no big problem, you can learn next test or something", but it isn't that easy. I'm quite addicted to playing computer games. I just can't learn. Even though i really want to, i just can't memorize those facts. In my report i got 1 A (programming), and the rest are all D's, and the one F. (Not quite sure if this is right, in Austria we got from 1-5, where 1 is the best. So i got 1x 1, about 10x 4 and 1x5).You got any tips for me how to learn? Just for example the one F/5 is about different spectroscopies, like Infrared, High-performance liquid chromatography and so on. That's really hard stuff in my opinion, i just can't learn it, i somehow don't want to understand it. And i don't want to stop the school, because one day i want to become a programmer, and that for i almost need to finish that school, there is no school like this in the next 150km.

And yeah, then there is this hot girl in my class i have a crush on since like a year. She sits almost in front of me, and somehow i just can't concentrate, i have to think of her, look at her how beautiful she is and so on. Since like 3-4 month's i can't sleep good at night, because i often dream of her. Sometimes i really want to cry, but i can't. It is really hard for me. And since i told her how i like her and so on, and she said she doesn't like me this way, just as a friend, everything is much harder. Have you got any tips for me here too?

BTW: I'm 17.

**tl;dr:** I'm bad in school mostly because i'm addicted to computer games. Need some tips how to learn properly. 
Girl i have a crush on for over a year doesn't like me back and i can't sleep properly, and in school i have to think of her about all the time.
