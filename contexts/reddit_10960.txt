I'm autistic and worthless. (18m)
I was diagnosed with mild autism as a todler. I was bullied in school to no end. I was raised in a strict Christian family that can't take a fucking joke. After my parents got divorced I came to the realisation that marriage and true love is just a lie. I have suffered from ADHD, depression, anxiety, and a low self-esteem. I'm ugly as hell and will always be alone. I can't take the pain anymore! The only reason I'm still here is because my family will be heart broken without me. How can I stop the pain?
