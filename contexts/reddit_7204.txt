What are some things you do at work but are told to never tell the customer?
When I worked at a call center and some disgruntled customer wanted to speak to a supervisor, sometimes the operator next to us played "the supervisor."  If I was free, I would do the same for her/him.  The company was well aware of the practice.  It was all about managing "customer expectations."   ; P
