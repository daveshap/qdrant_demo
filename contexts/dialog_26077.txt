MAX: You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
FAITH: I know. I don't always do exactly what I'm told. So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?' And you said -- come on Max.
MAX: I said, 'Yeah. I'd even do it for free.'
FAITH: Uh huh. And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me. I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
MAX: And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
FAITH: 'We might as well make the best of it.'
