RAYBURN: Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
CREASY: You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
RAYBURN: Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
CREASY: And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
RAYBURN: You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
RAYBURN: It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
CREASY: A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
RAYBURN: So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
RAYBURN: What are you doing here?
CREASY: I came to visit you.
RAYBURN: Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
CREASY: A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
RAYBURN: Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
CREASY: Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
RAYBURN: Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
