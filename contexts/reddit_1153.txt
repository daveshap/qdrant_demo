does anyone else sometimes feel PHYSICALLY sick from anxiety?
about a year and a half ago i had just found out my partner at the time had been cheating on me for 4 months, i felt stupid and betrayed and i felt like the blood in my body was moving around too fast? like my stomach had flipped and i couldn’t breathe properly and then i started feeling sick, i feel sick all the time. like at least once a day, so i wasn’t worried about it but then i suddenly felt something go up my throat and i had to run to the toilet and i was sick, quite a lot. i cried for a while and forgave them, it happened again but it’s over now and i’m with someone that makes me really happy but some things still make me feel like that, i haven’t been properly sick again since but things like exams and especially my speaking exam that’s coming up (next week) make me super anxious and honestly just getting up and going to school. i feel like i have to put in double the effort to do anything that other people do, and it really sucks.
