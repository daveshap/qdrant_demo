How my dad treats my mom
So, I’ll try to keep this short but a bit of background info may be required. So my dad grew up with an abusive stepdad, so that’s his excuse for how he acts sometimes, given he’s definitely not as bad, he’s got his moments.

Anyways, I love both my parents and they love each other, however, there seems to be constant tension between them no matter what. The thing with my dad is that he believes my mother gets all the attention so he’ll often do or say things that brings her down in order for him to look superior. He might do this by talking to her like she’s stupid and say things like, “honey, I know this kind of stuff it hard for you to understand”, or he will make a big deal out of things that she’s wrong about. 

I’ve tried to talk to him about it but any time I do, he plays victim and say, “yup, it’s always dads fault”.
Honestly, I don’t know how to deal with this anymore. I know they won’t get divorced, and anytime I mention marriage counseling my mom tries to change the conversation cause she hates the conflict it brings up.
I’m at a loss :(
