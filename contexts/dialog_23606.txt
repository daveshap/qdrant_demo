LORNA: You here to see my mother?
GEORGE: Yeah.
LORNA: She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
LORNA: Hungry?
GEORGE: A little.
LORNA: This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
GEORGE: No thanks.
LORNA: You're my mother's hairdresser?
GEORGE: I do her hair, yeah.
LORNA: Chopped liver?
GEORGE: No thanks.
LORNA: Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
GEORGE: No thanks.
LORNA: Did you hear me?
GEORGE: Yeah.
LORNA: Well, are you? Are you queer?
GEORGE: ... yeah.
LORNA: C'mon, are you or aren't you?
GEORGE: Gee, this is great.
LORNA: C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
GEORGE: Why do you wanna know so bad?
LORNA: See if you've been making it with my mother.
GEORGE: What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
LORNA: Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
GEORGE: Have you ever made it with a girl?
LORNA: I asked you first.
GEORGE: Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
LORNA: Well, are you?
GEORGE: Am I what?
LORNA: Making it with my mother?
GEORGE: I'd like to do your hair sometime.
LORNA: Why?
GEORGE: ... just, you could look very heavy...
LORNA: Don't make conversation with me.
GEORGE: What?
LORNA: You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
GEORGE: Yeah, it is.
LORNA: I never get my hair done.
GEORGE: No kidding.
LORNA: In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
GEORGE: No shit.
LORNA: You think that's funny, don't you?
GEORGE: Yeah.
LORNA: You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
GEORGE: Yeah...
LORNA: Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
GEORGE: No.
LORNA: Then what do you think?
GEORGE: That you're just like your mother.
LORNA: I am not like my mother!
GEORGE: You are.
LORNA: I am not!
GEORGE: You are.
LORNA: I am not!
GEORGE: Look... Do you wanna fuck me?
LORNA: Yeah.
GEORGE: Right now?
LORNA: Yeah.
