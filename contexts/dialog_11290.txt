JIMMY: We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
HENRY: Paulie was just talking about him.
JIMMY: Well, we gotta dig him up again.
HENRY: What?
JIMMY: The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
HENRY: It's been six months.
JIMMY: It's still better than letting somebody find him.
HENRY: If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
JIMMY: Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
