What's your approach to a job interview, tactically?
What's your approach to job interviews?

I'm torn between an on-message politician, or attempting to show how I'd be to work with (which is casual). After a few cringe-y job interviews recently I'm thinking I need to act like the organization I'm applying to is the only place I want to work (in a subdued manner) and have well researched why I want to work there and what project they've completed that makes them compelling to me.

What has been your most successful interview tactic? If you're a hiring manager, what do you want to see, or hate to see in a candidate? I'm trying not to overthink things too much but I need some outside perspective here to re-stabilize.
