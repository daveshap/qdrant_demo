SMECKER: The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
DUFFY: They shot him at a downward angle. They put him on his knees.
SMECKER: Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
GREENLY: Uh. Shit, I, uh...
SMECKER: It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?! They sure as fuck did!
SMECKER: And number three, Dolly.
DOLLY: Uh... two shooters!
SMECKER: Fan-fuckin-tastic!
SMECKER: Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
DUFFY: What about one guy with two guns?
SMECKER: Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.
