ROY: What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
BALLARD: No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
ROY: You're lying!
BALLARD: I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday. That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
ROY: That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
BALLARD: I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
WESLEY: So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
CHARLIE: We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size... He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
