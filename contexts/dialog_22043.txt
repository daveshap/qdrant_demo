ASHLEY: Nick --
RUDY: When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
ASHLEY: Nick, what are you --
RUDY: I'M NOT NICK! You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
ASHLEY: Nick, I love you --
RUDY: JESUS CHRIST!

RUDY: I'M NOT NICK!
RUDY: Get the hell off of me!
ASHLEY: Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
ASHLEY: He'll kill you.
RUDY: You're not hearing me here --
ASHLEY: My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
RUDY: He didn't find" Nick's letters
ASHLEY: Nick, please, it's me --
RUDY: You told him about Nick's letters.
