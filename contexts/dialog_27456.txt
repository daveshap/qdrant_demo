RICHARD: Bonjour.
ETIENNE: Good morning.
FRANCOISE: Did you sleep well?
RICHARD: Not too bad.
FRANCOISE: I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
RICHARD: The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
ETIENNE: She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
RICHARD: Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
ETIENNE: We moved rooms because of him.
FRANCOISE: He tried to borrow money from us.
ETIENNE: What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
FRANCOISE: He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
ETIENNE: It's on an island that no one get to.
FRANCOISE: But he has been there, off course.
ETIENNE: It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
RICHARD: It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
ETIENNE: Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
