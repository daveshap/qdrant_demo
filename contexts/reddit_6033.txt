“Forced”? To use PTO
I’m posting this on behalf of my Fiancé and was just wondering if anyone else has dealt with it, and if so, what did you do?
She works at a warehouse, and due to Covid-19 her job has less and less orders every week. In March, a tornado came and destroyed the building and they got paid time off for about a week, then they had to relocate to a different state. It was okay, they got paid time and a half the entire time they were there which was about 2 months. They also got “compensated” for an extra week of PTO (40 hours). 
So in May they returned to their warehouse which is here in Tennessee but they’ve had almost no orders so for the past roughly a month, her entire team at work has been getting sent home early (after only working 4 hours, sometimes less than that) every day and sometimes they don’t even let them come in. Because of this, she’s either forced to use PTO or go without pay, which is crazy bc then she’d bring home about $250 a week compared to her normal amount of almost $600. 
Now it’s the middle of June and she’s almost through all of her PTO, leaving her with nothing left for the rest of this year and it isn’t even her fault considering she never misses work except for emergencies, but now she’s having to every single day. 
Just curious if anyone else has dealt with this as well. 

Also, unemployment isn’t an option because she still makes more than what they would offer her so she won’t get approved.
