[META] Welcome new visitors and thanks for bumping us to over 100,000 subscribers — just in time to put our new mods through a trial by fire. Things work differently here. Please read the rules!
**Welcome new users!**

We're glad you have decided to explore our little corner of evidence-based political discussion on the internet. Please be aware, however, that the rules for discussion on /r/NeutralPolitics are much stricter than elsewhere on reddit in order to protect the standard of discourse we Neutrons value.

Take a look at the sidebar and some of our top posts to get a feel for the place. Once you've explored a bit, feel free to participate in the discussions and make your own posts, but first, please [**read the guidelines.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines)

Any comments that do not comply with the rules are subject to removal. All posts will be reviewed by a mod for compliance with the rules before appearing in the subreddit.

Please don't downvote something just because you disagree! If you're inclined to downvote something, consider whether it may be more appropriate to report it for violating one of the stated rules.

If you have any questions, ask away. Otherwise, enjoy the subreddit!

**Four new mods!**

Just in time for our flood of new users, please welcome these four new mods to the /r/NeutralPolitics team:

* /u/fictionalpieces
* /u/hbendavid
* /u/issue9mm
* /u/vs845

We appreciate all the candidates who applied. If we didn't select you, please don't be discouraged. We put out these calls every once in a while, so there will be other opportunities.

**Over 100,000 subscribers!**

It's a milestone. Not the first, but a big one. Thanks to everyone who has helped make this a place for great discussions.

If you have questions related to our growth or new mods, this is the place to ask.

**Happy Holidays!**

It's been a rough and tumble year in politics. The NP mod team wishes everyone a peaceful and restful holiday season (so we all have the energy to jump back into the thick of it in the new year!) 

All the best,

— /r/NeutralPolitics mod team
