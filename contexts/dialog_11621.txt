ROY: And hello to you, too.
MYRA: I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
ROY: Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
MYRA: What?
ROY: The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
MYRA: But the setup's there. It's there now.
ROY: I don't think I need it.
MYRA: You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
ROY: Maybe I like it where I am.
