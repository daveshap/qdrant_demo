How to learn Latin?
I’m doing an MA in religious ethics and need to learn Latin. My school only offers Latin in the summer but it’s at the same time as Hebrew which i know would be harder to learn on my own. How can I learn Latin outside of my school? Has anyone purchased helpful software, an online class (for purchase or free), etc? I already know French and Spanish which is why I’m prioritizing Hebrew over Latin - I think it will be pretty easy for me to learn Latin given my other language experience.

TIA!
