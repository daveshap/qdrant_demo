MARGARET: How?
DAVID: Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
MARGARET: Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
MARGARET: Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
DAVID: Yeah.
MARGARET: What's that like?
DAVID: Well it's big. And it's blue ... ... It's really really blue.
MARGARET: Mmmm. Boy. It's hot up here.
MARGARET: You want some berries?
DAVID: Hunh?
MARGARET: I picked them myself. They grow wild up here. Mmm. So sweet.
DAVID: They just grow like that?
MARGARET: Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
