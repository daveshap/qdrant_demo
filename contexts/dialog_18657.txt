MRS. COOK: What's happening here?
SOFIE: We're going for a walk.
MRS. COOK: Do you think that's a good idea?
SOFIE: Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
MRS. COOK: What kind of doctor are you?
MUMFORD: Ph.D., psychologist.
MRS. COOK: Oh... not a real doctor.
MUMFORD: That's right, the fake kind.
