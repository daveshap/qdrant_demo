SLOAN: You idiot. You almost gave me a massive coronary.
BIG BLACK: I didn't mean to scare you like that.
SLOAN: Well you did.
BIG BLACK: Give me some?
SLOAN: I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street. You must be crazy, Julius.
BIG BLACK: Whoa, hold up li'l sis'. I done told you 'bout that. Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name. My true name is...
SLOAN: I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
BIG BLACK: BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
BIG BLACK: Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
SLOAN: I order out mostly. So what do I owe this visit to?
BIG BLACK: My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
SLOAN: Hook you up? The Mau-Mau's? You must be smoking. Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
BIG BLACK: So now I see where you're coming from. Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
SLOAN: Who are you revolting against?
BIG BLACK: We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color. And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
SLOAN: Please.
BIG BLACK: If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours. What's his name again?
SLOAN: Delacroix.
BIG BLACK: Yeah, him.
SLOAN: What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
BIG BLACK: C'mon, why not? The Monkees had a show. Look at all that other junk that's on TV. We got underground cult following.
SLOAN: You don't have the demographics.
BIG BLACK: So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting? I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
SLOAN: That'swhatI'msayin'. I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
BIG BLACK: There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you. Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
SLOAN: If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative. You got your ways to affect change, I have mine. And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
BIG BLACK: My own sister throwin' me out. I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right. Don't bother letting me out.
SLOAN: That's mighty black of you.
DUNWITTY: Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
DELACROIX: It's right and tight. Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
SLOAN: Hello.
DELACROIX: This is Cheeba.
CHEEBA: Nice to meet you.
DELACROIX: And this is Manray.
