I've lost my girlfriends trust
I love my girlfriend to bits. Shes amazing, but I got a fb messege from my ex the other day needing someone to talk to and a bit of advice as she just got diagnosed with bipolar.. being the nice guy I am I gave advice and was there to talk. My gf found out and wasn't to happy, she would have been fine with it if I wasnt so paranoid about her talking to her ex and guys in general.  I do admit I have come along way with trust since we first started our relationship, but now I have lost hers. I have been honest and said sorry and I wil never talk to the ex again. I just hope I havent screwed my relationship.
