One credit card down—one to go!
Just paid off the last $440 on my PayPal credit card and I’m so proud of myself!!! I’ve been slowly paying off the balance of $1,500 since last August. 

Now to focus on the big boy: my discover card with a balance of just under $9k...

While I don’t know how well-received this will be, what I get in weekly unemployment and the boost from the stimulus check has made it actually possible for me to get out of debt by the end of July (when the CARES act lapses). I haven’t been out of debt in close to 6 years and I never thought that being unemployed would be the thing that HELPED me.

I do have a question—does anyone get legit anxiety before they make big payments on their cards? I find myself obsessively checking over the entire month’s dues before I hit “pay”.
