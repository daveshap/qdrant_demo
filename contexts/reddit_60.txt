Can someone’s bf just forget to hangout with his girl qhen he was the one who asked in the first place?
Ok so not me but my best friends (f16) boyfriend asked her if she wanted to hangout with him (m16). She said yes but when she went to the hangout spot, he wasnt there and didn’t show up. When she asked him about it later he said he forgot about it. I hadn’t trusted her bf for a while as he gave off bad vibes and stuff. I don’t wanna see my friend hurt.
