PEGGY: You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
RICHARD: How, did you know about my grandfather?
PEGGY: Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
RICHARD: Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
RICHARD: But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
PEGGY: I don't know.
RICHARD: I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
PEGGY: That's why I was getting a divorce.. What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
RICHARD: You look pretty good for a corpse.
PEGGY: Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
RICHARD: You're giving me the creeps.
PEGGY: Am I dead or not?
RICHARD: There's one way to find out.
PEGGY: What're you doing?
RICHARD: Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
