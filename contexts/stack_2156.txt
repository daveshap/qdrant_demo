How is the ball \"activated\" in DropShot? What determines when the ball loses its shell or goes super-saiyan?I've heard people claim it has to do with:How hard you hit the ballHow many times the ball has been hit since it touched the floor lastHow high off the floor the ball isBased on my observations so far, every one of these is incorrect.  So what actually causes it?
