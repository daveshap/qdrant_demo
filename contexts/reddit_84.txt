Why do I feel like I have no-one to trust
At school I would say I’m popular like everyone knows who i am and i have lots of friend but i don’t have a best friend the last best friend i had changed ever since we started high school she started swearing and bullying other people and i didn’t know where to go to when i go to my parents i feel like if i say some thing about my things that are going on they wouldn’t get it they are definitely supportive I’m just not sure what to do


The closest thing that i have to best friends are a bunch if girls who are very nice but i think that I’m invisible to them because when we are eating with each other in the canteen they never talk to me they only say hi and how are you and that’s pretty much it

If anyone has any advice please help
