Speaking a second language other than English during meetings?
I was invited to a research discussion group in which all of the members were from the same area with same second language. (we all work in the US). 

At the beginning everyone was talking in English, but after a while they switched to the second language. 

I could understand the discussion as I’m also a speaker. However some of the terminology they used were different then what I have learned before so i felt awkward. 

I was wondering what might be your reaction in this situation? Just curious about people’s thoughts
