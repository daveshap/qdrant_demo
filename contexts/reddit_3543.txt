Focus on becoming the right person - it makes sense why I’m still single
I’m turning 26 this summer and I’ve never had a relationship. It may sound stupid, but I think it’s true what I hear, “stop trying to find the right person, and focus on becoming the right person”.  

I like to believe I’m a good person and I’ve made a lot of improvements over these past two years, but I still have a lot of work to do. 

I’m not exactly good looking, but I believe it’s my personality that others find unattractive.   
I have insecurities, self-worth issues and lack of confidence. I see people with worse issues than me who still manage to have a relationship and that would make me mad, but I have to stop comparing myself to others. And I can only imagine how any relationship I managed to find would turn out. 

If I’m not happy with myself how can I expect others to be happy with me? I can’t have the mindset that someone else will come along and make me happy, that’s a lot to put on one person. 

I hope to get to the point were I like/love myself, lead a healthy lifestyle and were I’m content going through life single. If someone comes along great, if not, no problem I’ll still be happy. 

Sorry if it’s a cheesy post, just felt like expressing my thoughts.
