MR. JOHNSON: Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
DAVID: What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
MR. JOHNSON: No I know ... I know I do ... But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
DAVID: Just listen to me ...
MR. JOHNSON: ... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
DAVID: Forget about that!
MR. JOHNSON: Oh ... Okay. ... But I really liked it.
DAVID: Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
MR. JOHNSON: Why?
DAVID: So they can have their hamburgers!
MR. JOHNSON: You know what I really like?
DAVID: ... What's that?
MR. JOHNSON: Christmastime.
