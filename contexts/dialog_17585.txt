ROPER: Tell him to give me a raise.
SOLIS: He says, Thank you very much." I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye
SOLIS: Roper.
ROPER: What?
SOLIS: Are you going to make this hard for me?
ROPER: Depends. What's up?
SOLIS: There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
ROPER: Define concern.
SOLIS: What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
ROPER: Your concern is heartwarming.
SOLIS: It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
ROPER: Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
SOLIS: His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
