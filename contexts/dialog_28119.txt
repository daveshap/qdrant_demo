DEBORAH: Are we understood?
LOMBARD: You watched the tape? Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
DEBORAH: Huh! Really? Hotels?
LOMBARD: The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
LOMBARD: Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
DEBORAH: W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
