First Day Experience
So, my first two days at work have been...interesting.

During college, I was at an internship that started off great. When new management came in, I left with the thought "nothing can be this bad."

Well, there's competition. On my very first day, and even more on the second day, I learned that nearly everyone talks about everyone else. Im pretty sure something was even said about me as two coworkers were whispering, and made eye contact with me when they looked back to see if I was listening. Then they started writing notes (lol). Even the one of the two that were gossiping in that instance, came back to me and talked about the other person. Im just trying to keep my head down and mind my business. Thing is, this is my first full-time role so I dont really have any other options. Anyone else have similar experiences?
