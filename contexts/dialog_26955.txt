NICHOLAS: I know the owner of Campton Place. I could talk to him in the morning.
CHRISTINE: Don't. It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
NICHOLAS: Goodnight.
CHRISTINE: I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
NICHOLAS: The maitre d' called you Christine.
CHRISTINE: Right. Call me Christy.
NICHOLAS: Goodnight, Christy. It was nice meeting you.
CHRISTINE: Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
NICHOLAS: Keep it.
CHRISTINE: I have a confession to make. Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
NICHOLAS: Seriously? What did they say?
CHRISTINE: They said five hundred. I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit. I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
