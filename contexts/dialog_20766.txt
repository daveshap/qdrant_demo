DR. ARMBRUSTER: A homosexual encounter.
JOE: Get real.
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
JOE: Uh.... No. Not really.
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
LISA: You have a problem with gays, Joe.
JOE: Not especially.
LISA: How many gays do you know?
JOE: How many do you know?
LISA: Lots.
JOE: Who?
LISA: Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
JOE: Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
LISA: Duh...
JOE: Since when?
LISA: Probably since she was born.
JOE: Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
LISA: Okay, Joe...
JOE: I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey
LISA: Fine, Joe.
JOE: And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
LISA: That's perfectly clear.
JOE: Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to <u>breathe</u> on me?""
