WILLIAM: You were saying...
ANNA: Yes. The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
WILLIAM: But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
ANNA: You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
MARTIN: Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
WILLIAM: Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
MARTIN: I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
WILLIAM: Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
MARTIN: Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
ANNA: Is that right?
MARTIN: Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
ANNA: I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
MARTIN: Oh dear. He wasn't friendly during the filming?
ANNA: Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
