CATHERINE: No, don't do that...
BOBBY: Shut up...
CATHERINE: No inner feeling.
BOBBY: That's right.
CATHERINE: I don't believe vou.
CATHERINE: I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
BOBBY: That's what you said?
CATHERINE: Something witty and devastating like that.
CATHERINE: As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl... How are you?
BOBBY: I'm fine.
CATHERINE: Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
BOBBY: Is he?
CATHERINE: Yes.
CATHERINE: Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
BOBBY: Yeah, I think I could.
CATHERINE: Robert?
BOBBY: What?
CATHERINE: I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
BOBBY: Of course I'd like to.
