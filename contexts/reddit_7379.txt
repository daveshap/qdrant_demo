My rent is $45 a month, which includes heat, electricity and about 50 cars. Let me explain...
About two months ago I hit rock bottom. My job and its shitty salary couldn't sustain me anymore. I was about to get kicked out. Then I had an idea. I live in an apartment or I used to anyway, and they have a huge garage. Parking spots cost $45 a month. I spoke to management and they told me that it won't happen. So I went to another apartment and asked them. I said I'll pay you the $45 a month for a spot but instead of a car I'm going to set up a little section for myself. Well, holy shit he said yes. I put up a makeshift wall so that no one will be disturbed by my presence, I'm only there at night really so the people aren't active while I'm there and I still have my shit job but now who gives a damn, my rent is $45. 

Remember folks, we live in a democratic society, lol not really it's an oligarchy but the important thing to remember is, society doesn't have to dictate how you find your happiness. I don't work hard at my job, at all. Hard work doesn't pay off if you don't mind living in a garage. 

Peace out!
