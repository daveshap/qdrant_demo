SHELDRAKE: To me?
BUD: I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
SHELDRAKE: Oh, yes. Thanks.
BUD: The mirror is broken. It was broken when I found it.
SHELDRAKE: So it was. She threw it at me.
BUD: Sir?
SHELDRAKE: You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
BUD: I know how it is.
SHELDRAKE: You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
BUD: No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
SHELDRAKE: Yeah. You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
BUD: Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
SHELDRAKE: Put me down for Thursday again.
BUD: Roger. And I'll get that other key.
