[UK] Asked to suggest my own contract requirements for start-up role. Thoughts? Ideas? [XPost from /r/UKjobs]
I've been in discussions with a small start-up over the past few weeks and have been made a "formal" offer in the form of an email, including the salary offer. As you might expect, the role (a software development role) and responsibilities aren't very well defined since the project roadmap is prone to change. What I found most odd though is that I haven't been given a contract to look through, but rather have been asked to send them a list of "requirements" I'd like to be included.

This struck me as odd at first, but I figured this made some sense since they don't have anyone handling HR on their end. I've decided to look at this as an opportunity to include any and all (reasonable) terms of employment that might be worth considering.

Firstly, is there any standard list of terms which **should/must** be included? and, Secondly what terms would you include?
One that comes to mind would be overtime work, specifically: what constitutes overtime work, how is it requested/approved and what would the pay rate be. Is this a standard thing to include in contracts? I've been bitten by this before but never saw a proper way to handle it.

Any other ideas or things to look out for? Perhaps from personal experiences?
