HOLLY: Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
LEE: Hmm.
HANNAH: Oh, God...
HOLLY: Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And... you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money.
HANNAH: Well, that...th-that's fine.
HOLLY: But what I decided to do is some writing. Yeah, I think I've had it with acting. You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls. And I can't handle another rejection. Now let's face it here. I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life. You know--something with a future. I'm not sixteen anymore. It's just...crazy! I've got...an idea for a story. More than one. And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
