To all my friends and fellow fighters, if you're considering suicide please just hear my message, please.
Wait buddy I know it feels like there is no way out of this, but the way you're feeling right now will change if you give it some or  months of time.

Trust me wait, nothing is permanent thigs do sort out eventually.
