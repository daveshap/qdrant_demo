ALFREDO: 'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...' You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
SALVATORE: But you don't have any kids!!!
ALFREDO: All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them!
