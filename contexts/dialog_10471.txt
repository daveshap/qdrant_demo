WASHINGTON: If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them? Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
JOHN ADAMS: Lafayette is a child!
WASHINGTON: Lafayette is my friend! He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child. But he would have died before he would have let me down.
SAM ADAMS: Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
WASHINGTON: God damn you, Sam Adams! You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
