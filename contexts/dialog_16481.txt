WARDEN: What is this, Rogoff?
DR. ROGOFF: I don't know yet.
WARDEN: Who is this man?
DR. ROGOFF: He's just been fingerprinted, and I'll run these blood tests right away. We'll find out soon enough.
WARDEN: He's not Madison?
DR. ROGOFF: Not even close.
DR. ROGOFF: I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
WARDEN: A headache?
DR. ROGOFF: I did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I've never seen this man before. Neither have the guards. I don't think he's in the system.
