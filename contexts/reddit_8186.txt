What are the legal/ethical limits on the President of the U.S. disclosing highly confidential information to foreign officials, and are there any historical examples of presidents doing so? If so, what is the protocol?
In light of the recent story of Trump disclosing highly confidential intel to the Russian officials in their Oval Office meeting last week ([The Washington Post's original story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.fc09aca19eb5); [CNN's coverage] (http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/15/politics/trump-russia-classified-information/index.html); [The New York Time's coverage](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/us/politics/trump-russia-classified-information-isis.html); [The Atlantic's coverage](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/trump-classified-information/526797/)),

I'm wondering:

1) what the legal and ethical framework is surrounding the disclosure of highly confidential information by the president (and the consequences of breaking those limits);

2) whether there are other examples of Presidents unilaterally disclosing such information in conversation with foreign officials; and

3) and whether there is usually a specific protocol that is followed when disclosing such information to foreign officials.
