If you already know what you want to study, this may be useful in selecting a university...
Once you get to college, many of you will get on LinkedIn. 

At first, I thought LinkedIn was just a pretentious version of Facebook where people flaunt their credentials. In reality, it's a legit professional networking site that recruiters use to find new talent. 

Seriously, I get messages from recruiters offering me a new job about once per week.

Anyways, the website collects data from user accounts and uses it to create detailed profiles of universities and employers. If you go to a university page on LinkedIn, you can see a list of the top employers, locations, industries, etc. for alumni. Enter in key words, and you can narrow it down more. 

For example, thinking of studying electrical engineering at NC State? Click [here](https://www.linkedin.com/school/north-carolina-state-university/people/?keywords=electrical%20engineering) to see a list of the most common employers for NCSU EE graduates. 

People treat US News & World Report rankings like they're the authoritative source for which university is the best. In reality, it's the *employers* who do the rating by where they decide to do their recruiting. If you know what company or what type of company you'd like to work for, this tool offers some valuable insight.
