SALAZAR: I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process. Not only physical, but also psychological.
ROBERT: I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
SALAZAR: That would be very helpful to me. Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico. I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.
