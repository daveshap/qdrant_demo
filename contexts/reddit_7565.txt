MA Art History at American University
Hello! 

I just received news that I was accepted for the MA in Art History at the American University. Was hoping to see if anybody knows anything about the program, cause I would like another perspective aside from the people Iâ€™ve talked to at AU. Or in general if somebody wants to talk about getting an MA in art history, that would be nice as well. 

Thank you!
