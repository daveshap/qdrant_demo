Why exactly a RLC Circuit powered by DC oscillates? First sorry if the question is stupid... I am learning.I am trying to visualize here, without equations, what happens to a RLC circuit that makes it oscillate.Consider a RLC circuit, a switch and a 12V battery. Both L and C are initially discharged.OK, I see that the role of the resistor is to damp the oscillations, so, lets consider R=0 and L and C are ideal.At t=0 I close the switch.The current starts flowing thru the resistor and reaches the inductor.At this time, the inductor is an open circuit and the capacitor is a short circuit.Current tries to reach the capacitor but the inductor is preventing it.Magnetic field is building in the inductor. Current is increasing and its Voltage is dropping.Current finally reaches the capacitor. It starts charging. Its voltage starts to rise. Capacitor is building electric field.So at this point magnetic field is rising on the inductor and electric field is rising on the capacitor.I understand that oscillations happen because energy is being transferred from the capacitor to the inductor and vice-versa. But if both the magnetic field and electric field are rising, how can this oscillation happen.I was expecting to see one rising and one falling and vice versa, but both are rising when the circuit starts.If all my explanations are wrong, please forget them and explain what is really happening in terms of current, voltages and fields to make the whole thing oscillate.Thanks.
