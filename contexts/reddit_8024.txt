Living on PhD stipend?
I'm a Master's student but I'd like to consider going for a PhD, but I'm concerned about living on so little for so long. I know it shouldn't be about the money (and it isn't) but 25k a year for ~5-6 years just seems like relatively nothing. 

I should say I'll have quite a bit of debt after I get my MA (nothing from undergrad thankfully), and it's not like I have to live a particularly lavish lifestyle, but what worries me is needing emergency funds and not having them, or not being able to save up for the future until after I graduate. I know some of the other PhDs in my area have rented houses together and this isn't a cheap area but it's not like I ask them how their 401ks are doing either.

So my question is what's it like living on a stipend for a good part of your young-adult life? Are you pay-check to pay-check, or are you able to save a little rainy day money? And if you've graduated what are your savings like now?
