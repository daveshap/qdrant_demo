SAUNDERS: Ah. One of the supporting characters.
DIZ: Who?
SAUNDERS: That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
DIZ: Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
SAUNDERS: Yes. Mostly Puss." Oh
SAUNDERS: The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
DIZ: What do I play?
SAUNDERS: You play--left field.
DIZ: Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
SAUNDERS: Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
