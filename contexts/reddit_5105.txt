How am I supposed to improve as a candidate if no one will give feedback?
I have been searching for full-time employment in my field of work for months. I've had several interviews, but no luck. I hear good things about my experience and that I'll be considered for other roles, but still no offers or further contact. I do ask for feedback, but often don't hear anything back.

How am I supposed to improve as I candidate? Is it my experience? Did they not like my personality? Is it something else? It's really annoying that so many places are afraid of litigation, so they're afraid to provide any sort of feedback on why a candidate isn't selected. It's frustrating not knowing on what I can do to improve, perhaps gain more work experience, learn more skills, learn how to interview better. I don't know.
