Single word for \"give custody\": to custode? I'm wondering how best to describe \"to give custody\" in single-word format. Obviously to \"custode\" is not a word, but I'm looking for something similar.What is a single-word for \"give custody\"?Background: This is in relation to finding a phrase to use in my software development project. A user clicks a button, and another user becomes a \"delegate\" or gets given \"custody\" of a certain activity, I'm looking for a word to put on or name the button. I will most likely use \"Delegate\however, I still want to know if there's a single-word for \"to give custody\".
