WELLES: What is this?
NUN: Those are her belongings.
WELLES: Her belongings?
NUN: That's her suitcase. I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
WELLES: Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
NUN: She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet. Oh, I adored her. I supposed I always hoped she'd be back. After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things. Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
WELLES: I'll do what I can.
