I need some reassurance
me (15m) and a girl (15f) were at a party last night and we had sex. i had 2 condoms with me. she was on her period. we were both drunk. in the middle i switched condoms because it was covered in blood but put it in after taking the first one off and putting the 2nd one on we continued to have sex. im worried that shes gonna be pregnant and even tho it sounds stupid i havent been able to stop thinking about it. im very worried
