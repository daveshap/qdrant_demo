How do I measure compliance to Information security policies? I work in an organisation with 3 levels as far as information security is concerned. I'm sitting at level two where we develop policies and also assist with the standards. One of the most difficult things which have come to light is how to measure compliance to policies. The risk managers at level 1 need some sort of measures to evaluate whether they comply with the set policies or not. I have tried to put metrics (KRIs) together in order to achieve the purpose. How practical and detailed should the metrics be?
