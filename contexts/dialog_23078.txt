SHERIFF BURKE: Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
DEWEY: Keeping my eye on Sidney.
SHERIFF BURKE: Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
DEWEY: Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
SHERIFF BURKE: There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
DEWEY: Have you contacted the bureau?
SHERIFF BURKE: They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
DEWEY: You think he could still be in town?
SHERIFF BURKE: He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
DEWEY: She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
SHERIFF BURKE: Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
DEWEY: She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
SHERIFF BURKE: Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
DEWEY: Yes, sir.
SIDNEY: Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
TATUM: You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
SIDNEY: But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
TATUM: Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
SIDNEY: What do you think about when you're having sex?
TATUM: With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
SIDNEY: Who?
TATUM: Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God
SIDNEY: How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
TATUM: During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on."
SIDNEY: No way.
TATUM: Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, Eight is enough...""
SIDNEY: What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
TATUM: Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
SIDNEY: TATUM!
TATUM: Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
TATUM: There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
SIDNEY: Deal.
DEWEY: You girls ready.
SIDNEY: Yeah.
DEWEY: Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
TATUM: No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
DEWEY: Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
TATUM: Shit.
