KAY: I was going to take a swim.
WHALE: I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
KAY: Right.
WHALE: You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
HANNA: I do not think you anything anymore. Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.

HANNA: Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
WHALE: No. Let me lie here. Thank you.
DWIGHT: Boone! You awake? Eight o'clock.
CLAY: Fuck off!
DWIGHT: You told me to get you up, asshole.
CLAY: I'm up. Thanks.
DWIGHT: Hasta la vista, Boone. And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
