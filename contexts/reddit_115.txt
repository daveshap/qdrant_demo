My boyfriend bought me gifts for Christmas, I want to break up but I don’t want to waste his money.
I’ve been dating my boyfriend ever since Christmas Eve, we’ve argued a couple of times which were quite tiring. I always have to tell him how to treat me or how to make me feel valued and it’s so tiring. I don’t want to leave him broken but I don’t want to date someone who doesn’t know how to properly treat a girl. For Christmas, he bought me gifts and I don’t want to waste his money because it’ll make me feel bad that he bought it and I broke up with him. 


Another thing: 
I’m a guarded person, I love hard, and I’m upfront. But, I have trust issues and I can’t bring myself to be happy or carefree when I’m dating someone because I feel like I’ll get betrayed, cheated on, or worse. When he doesn’t respond to my texts, it hurts a lot and I want to make him feel the pain of how I feel. I always feel like he’s probably “talking to another girl” but I can’t trust myself and I feel trapped. 

What do I do in this situation? Should I break up with him?
