Friction between two blocks on top of each other I am a little bit confused to the concept of friction between two blocks on top of each other. there could be two situations: the first situation is when all surfaces are frictionless including that one between the two blocks. if one force $F$ pulls the lower block, then I read somewhere that we should consider both blocks as one block and the upper block will remain at rest and so they have the same acceleration. but still, i don't get why it will remains at rest?second situation:if there is a friction between the two blocks, then applying an F force will make the upper block slide with it's own acceleration. Is this right? and regarding the force needed to make the upper block slide, is there any specifications?
