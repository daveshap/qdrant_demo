How does it work when you retake pre-reqs?
In a few years I plan on going to PT school but I still have to take some chems and physics because my undergrad major didn’t require those classes. There’s also some classes that I took in my undergrad that I got C’s (and 1 D in) and I’ve been thinking about retaking those as well depending on how important they are for PT school. None of them are really science/math based classes so that’s good but my dumbass did get a D in psych bc I took it in my early years where I just wasn’t giving a shit about school. So  let’s say I retake psych and got an A, would my D be replaced by the A or would the average be taken of the two? How does it work? Or does it vary between school?

Thanks for the help!
