NATHAN LEE: Son, that was some trip you went on...
DAVID LEE: Where was you, Daddy?
NATHAN LEE: That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
DAVID LEE: Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
NATHAN LEE: Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
DAVID LEE: What happened afta that?
NATHAN LEE: The rains started to come, and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up, and tell us when to move -- but we didn't mind the rain comin' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there, watchin' the guards and they weapons get wet, and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute. I was laughin' all over inside -- a minute, that's all, but what a minute it was!
