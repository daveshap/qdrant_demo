I got trolled by Brown yesterday.
Yesterday I got an email from Brown that said there was an update in my portal so I obviously logged into the portal as quickly as possible to find a couple of messages posted below the box where you can click on your status updates. The messages read "An update to your application was last posted June 25, 2020. If you choose to accept this offer of admission to the class of 2024, you may not defer your entry date." So understandably, I thought that the status update was going to read that I had gotten off the waitlist.

But nope. I click on the status update and it makes it very clear that that is not the case and that in fact they are no longer considering my application. So I shoot the the admissions office an email asking for confirmation and turns out the portal was bugged and I had gotten my hopes up for nothing.

I'm not really upset at all really as I am content with where I am currently planning on going, but at the same time the ole bait and switch was kind of annoying, and if I *really, really* wanted to go to Brown, I would probably be super depressed and straight up pissed right now.

tl;dr: got an email saying my Brown status was updated; portal said I got in; I did not get in
