I turned 15 today, no one in class knew or cared I even told them couple days ago. So I'm turning to you guys
Edit: thanks for all the birthday wishes I really appreciate it and also thank you whoever gave me awards. 
Update: I uploaded on my snapchat story that it's my birthday now all my friends seem to know it's my birthday and they all wished a happy birthday.
But r/teenagers I love you guys thank you you guys made my day
