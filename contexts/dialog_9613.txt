BREWER: It's a guy in a cage.
RAMBO: American?
BREWER: Can't tell. Pretty tall. He's real scrunched up in that thing.
RAMBO: Let me see.
RAMBO: Roundeye.
BREWER: Alright. Home run.
RAMBO: Torture cage. Can't stand... can't sit... for days. Sometimes weeks.
BREWER: Bastards. Let's get some shots.
RAMBO: That guy's not going to make it.
BREWER: Nothing we can do, man.
RAMBO: I'm getting him out.
BREWER: What? Are you crazy? We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
RAMBO: You never been in one of those things.
BREWER: I suppose you have...
BREWER: It's orders! You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it. John Wayne is dead, man.
RAMBO: You take pictures and split. I'm going in.
