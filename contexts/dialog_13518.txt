DAVID: You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
MOISHE: You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
MOISHE: David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
DAVID: Dad, don't start.
MOISHE: I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
DAVID: Three years.
MOISHE: Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.
