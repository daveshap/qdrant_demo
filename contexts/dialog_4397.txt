LUPOVICH: I know it. The old slaughterhouse. Hey, Sal. That little weasel we popped today? He's got something for us. I knew he would once he thought about it.
SAL: Shit, that was fast.
LUPOVICH: 12-year olds. They scare easy. Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash. Come with me.
SAL: I'm on my way home. Can you handle it yourself?
LUPOVICH: Oh, no. Please don't make me go by myself. I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
SAL: Fuckin' comedian. See you tomorrow.
