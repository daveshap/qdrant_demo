What is the point of Dirichlet prior? I understand the multinomial distribution and that it can calculate the likelihood of some vector D to happen given the probability vector P' i.e. P(D|P'). Now with Dirichlet prior we are introducing a prior for those probabilities. However, up to my understanding Dirichlet prior is only used for the posterior (pls. correct me if I am wrong) P''=P(P'|D) which means if this vector D happens then what is the probability of it, but what is the point from calculating P(P'|D), is it for recalculating or lets say updating the probability P' to a new value P'' or is it used for something else?(Please bear with me: if the point from this is updating P' to P'' then we could do that directly without this lengthy process by increasing, using a math formula, a little the probabilities corresponding to the events happening in D and decreasing a little from the probabilities corresponding to those not in D)
