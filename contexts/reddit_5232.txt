Im currently in retail and the person i close with is smoking in the bathroom, always late, and never helps me out and makes me do all the work...Advice ?
So im currently working in retail and theres this person whom i close with. 

She never cleans the place up, shes in the bathroom for 20’ at a time, she smokes when everyone has left except us two, shes always late to work, and spends an extra 20’ on lunch...

Im about to leave this job and go to a new one so i dont really care but i dont want this to be something that someone else in the future has to go through. How can i tell me GM about the situation? I dont wanna rat her out but ik for a fact, that if someone were to close with her, he or she will hate it.
