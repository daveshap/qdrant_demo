SCOTTIE: Will you have dinner with me?
JUDY: Why?
SCOTTIE: Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
JUDY: No, you don't owe me anything.
SCOTTIE: Then will you for me?
JUDY: Dinner... and what else?
SCOTTIE: Just dinner.
JUDY: Because I remind you of her?
SCOTTIE: Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
JUDY: Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before. Okay.
SCOTTIE: I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
JUDY: Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
SCOTTIE: An hour?
JUDY: Mmm.
SCOTTIE: Okay.
