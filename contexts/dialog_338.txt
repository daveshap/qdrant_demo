LOC RHOD: My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
KORBEN: I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
LOC RHOD: Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
KORBEN: I don't think this is a good time...
LOC RHOD: ...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
KORBEN: Yeah, very big, a giant.
LOC RHOD: I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
