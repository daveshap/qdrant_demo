DANNY: What? Excuse me?... You're kidding, right?
GUY: Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
DANNY: Who? How would I know him?
GUY: He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
DANNY: You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
GUY: So you're saying it's not true.
DANNY: Look at me. DO I look Jewish? Look...
GUY: Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
DANNY: Do you know who you're fucking with here?
GUY: That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
DANNY: Listen to me....
GUY: Why would Nadelman lie?
DANNY: To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
GUY: Give me a reason not to.
DANNY: It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
GUY: Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
