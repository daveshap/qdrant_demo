White House interview
I applied to Penn (UPenn) in the regular round. 
In my application, I had mentioned that I would be living in the Washington D.C. area from December to February for some personal reasons. 
Last week, I got a call from someone pretending to be  a “secret service” agent. What secret service agent would call a random high schooler and tell them they’re “secret service”. After a brief conversation, I realised she wasn’t kidding. 
I was supposed to interview with a Penn alumnus who worked in the white house, but she wouldn’t say who. She offered to send me a car the next afternoon to bring me to the white house. After a multitude of security checks, i was led into a room. It was a weird room because it was oval shaped. A minute later, guess who enters the room. The man himself. 
We talked for about an hour, and he assured me that I was definitely getting into Penn and that a rejection letter was fake news. 

Best interview ever.
