I got a call yesterday from the company I interviewed for on Tuesday, and they offered me the position.
Now is the Onboarding process. I verbally accepted the offer on the phone. I had to sign a lot of documents and scan and email them back to Human Resources. I got the paper for the drug test today and I went right away to take it at Labcorp. It’s time sensitive for 48 hours anyways but I wanted to take care of it right away. I don’t have any felonies on my record but I’m wondering isn’t the background check usually done before they offer you the position and not during the on boarding process? 

In the past I always thought that the background check always was done prior to them offering you the job. Am I right or wrong?
