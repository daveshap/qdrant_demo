New PhD graduate, starting over...with unpaid internship?
Hi,

Long time lurker finally finding the guts to tell my story. 

As of this weekend, I will have a PhD in Linguistics. I'm not going into academia, but I have an adjust gig lined up at a local community college for the next academic year.

I want out of teaching after that, so I've been looking at academic publishing. The university press in my city says they are happy to take as an intern, but it's unpaid. They said that they've had PhD interns before, and even their admin assistant has a PhD...my friend who's an acquisitions editor said this is true at their press as well. 

Between the adjuncting and my savings from a car accident settlement, and living with my boyfriend, I can technically *afford* an unpaid gig for 10 hours a week...but I'm wondering if it will look ridiculous on my resume to have an unpaid position at my level and my age (36)? Would you take this position, or would you find another way into an industry?

Thanks for any advice.
