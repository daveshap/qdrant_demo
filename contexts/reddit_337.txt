This is a southern baptist church, and I am not a fundamentalist....
The visiting pastor at this church were I'm paid to video is off on this anti-gay rant, people are cheering and I have never felt more awkward. I myself am not gay. But my beat friend and classmate of three years is gay. I as a young woman, have yet to label my sexuality. I know this is a church and I shouldn't expect much else. I am technically a member of this church, how I got the job. But I am really starting to view this as more of a job. In the past I have desired to "strengthen my faith" but as of now I don't know. My supposed lack of faith led to my breakup with an otherwise really nice guy. How can I be devoted to something that I may fundamentally disagree with....
