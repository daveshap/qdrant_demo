Using Split By Attributes in ArcGIS ModelBuilder? I wish to use \"split by attribute\" tool in ArcGIS ModelBuilder to split a shapefile (points with metadata) into different groups based on a parameter. The tool works and creates for example 4 .dpf files in the given folder but it does not seem to want to add these new files (tables) into ArcGIS automatically even though I specify \"add to display\but more importantly the output of the tool in ModelBuilder seems to be a dead-end that I cannot run any analysis on. This is a bottleneck in my model as I want my model to carry on working on these data sets. How can I do that?
