does anyone else watch TV/youtube to hear/see other people without actually socializing?
i’m introverted and agoraphobic. but i still like being connected with humanity and “interacting” with other people indirectly makes me feel less cripplingly alone and isolated. sometimes i’ll just put something on in the background while i do other things. i just want to hear human voices without the anxiety of being around other people
