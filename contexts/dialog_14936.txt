PAUL: Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
AMANDA: We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
GRANT: Hmmm.
PAUL: Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
AMANDA: ...once-in-a-lifetime.
PAUL: We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
GRANT: That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
PAUL: No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
GRANT: I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you canâ€™t fly low enough to see anything of interest.
AMANDA: You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
BILLY: How low?
PAUL: Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
AMANDA: From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
GRANT: That's hard to believe.
PAUL: Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
