Do I have a future in Student Affairs/Higher Education?
Hello there. 
I am a 25 year old currently working in a non-profit (mainly data, administrative tasks and event support). I am strongly considering a master's degree in Student Affairs/Higher Education. A brief synopsis of my "stats":

-Degree: Bachelor in Health Services Administration
-GPA: 3.71 Overall 3.68 Major GPA
-Work Experience: During college I was a part of of TRiO, which focused primarily on supporting first-generation students. As A first-gen myself, I was highly involved during my school years, because a tutor for transitional students, was a part of creating the inaugural club for the program, etc. etc. 

My worry is that I graduated in 2014 so it has been 4 years since I have been in a college environment. During my time away from college, I worked an administrative role for a health insurance company for 2 years, as a teacher for 1, and currently as a data coordinator for a scholarship and mentorship nonprofit for high school students. 

I have a strong interest in career development/academic advising/first generation student support. It is something I have considered since my senior year of graduation, but never bit the bullet for. I just do not want to set myself up for disappointment. Would consideration for an assistantship be pushing it as well? 

Should I just settle for a master's in my current job description (an MSW or MPA) or should I take the risk and follow my heart?
