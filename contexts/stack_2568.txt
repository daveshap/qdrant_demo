Choosing map projection by territory like ArcMap (but without ArcMap) When I worked with ArcMap, I had no problem with choosing projection<blockquote>  ArcMap has a large number of predefined projections organized by world, continent, and country. You can navigate quickly to appropriate projections for any part of the world.</blockquote>My current employer did not buy ArcMap, but I still need to choose an appropriate projection for my tasks. For example, I have got a list of coordinates in degrees (WGS84). I need to define (for example)some distances in meters areas in square metersmidpoints centroidsSo, I need to select appropriate projection, transform original coordinated to this projection, make calculation, and sometimes transform result back to WGS84. For this purposes I need mechanism to select the appropriate projection. What is it?
