I was unemployed for 3 years, and it's wrecking my chances of now getting a job. Any advice is helpful
I have a useless BA in political science from the UC system. I worked at a home improvement company for 2ish years after college, and then I was laid off.

Since being laid off, which has now been 3 years, I've been day trading stocks, mostly options, and I've been living off of that. I'm not rich, but day trading was paying rent and the bills.

When the market heavily went down back in march, I put my cash into VOO and BRK.B. My plan is to just leave it there for a long time. I do not want to day trade anymore. I want a "real job."

I have applied to a lot of jobs, and I've gotten phone interviews. But every time I bring up my liberal arts degree, the interview immediately goes south.

Every single time I'm asked the dreaded question of: what have you been doing the past 3 years? It immediately goes south when I tell them I was buying and selling stocks / reading quarterly reports. When I tell them I've now put my money into a safe tech ETF / berk, and I'm looking for a 9-5 job, I always get an awkward weird silence then never hear back from them.

I applied for a book keeping position that laughed when I said I was a former day trader.  The ironic thing was the job only paid 14 an hour.  I was averaging 200 a day with stocks (minus tax).

So what in the heck do I do? I had a phone screen at the job agency and the lady flat out told me they don't place people who've been unemployed for longer than 6 months.

Am I just destined to be an unemployable loser this life? I have assets, but I'm now cash poor so I need a job.

Any thoughts would be lovely. Feel free to be brutal.  I hear it all the time from my family.
