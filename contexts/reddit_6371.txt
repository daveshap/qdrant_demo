Brief reflections on interviewing 50 candidates for a 100k/year sales job
* Ten minutes early is the ideal arrival timeframe. When you arrive 20-30 minutes prematurely you're actually throwing off my day. Be it cutting my lunch short, or preventing me from using allotted time to handle other tasks. I suppose I could leave you up front until our actual interview time, but I don't want to be a dick.


* I disqualified an otherwise decent applicant because his nails were femininely long for a male. I've got to draw a LOT of conclusions from preciously little information, and this was one of them.

* If I ask what your current income is, don't avoid the question or speak in general terms. An applicant yesterday avoided the question up front, and then my partner asked it again more specifically, and he still avoided it. If you want to work for me, I need to know what you're coming from.


* If I can detect that you're lying about your previous income, and frequently I can, I will assume you inflated it by roughly 10%.

* Appear as though you want the job, even if you don't. You can always decline my offer. But I will not make an offer to somebody who isn't showing some degree of zeal. A fantastic applicant from four weeks ago just called back to ask about the job (which has been filled). I would have brought him on to phase two if he had just acted more interested up front!

* I get a handle on your zeal two ways: The questions you ask me about the job, and the way you close the interview. I absolutely love when somebody wraps up by saying "Do you have any concerns about me that I haven't addressed?" and "What is the next step?".


* The guy who just walked out remembered the receptionist's name and said goodbye. It's the little things...


* Be prepared to talk about what you do at home and hobbies. Some applicants have given weak or evasive answers that make me feel they're probably boring people.


* Turned down a guy who works in my tiny niche industry because his tie was loose and the top button wasn't done. I was on the edge, but he seemed a little unmotivated to me and that button made the difference. Again, drawing a lot of conclusions from limited evidence.


* Have solid, concise, honest answers for why you left a previous job. If you talk too much, I'll find similarities between my job and the job you left, and I will hit you with difficult questions.


* My first question is always the same: *You've told me about where you work today, and how successful you are in that position, why on earth would you want to leave?*
