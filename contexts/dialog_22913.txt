CONSTANCE: Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
LLOYD: No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing! Hello, Diane?
DIANE: Hi. You called me?
LLOYD: Yeah. I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
DIANE: Yeah?
LLOYD: Yeah. I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
DIANE: Thank you very much.
LLOYD: Whoah, what a day, huh?
DIANE: Yeah. What a day.
LLOYD: Yeah.
DIANE: Yeah.
LLOYD: Quick question - do you know who I am?
DIANE: Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
LLOYD: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You remember?
DIANE: No, I read it on the message.
LLOYD: Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out. Do you wanna go out?
DIANE: Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
LLOYD: Busy?
DIANE: Yes. Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
LLOYD: Are you busy on Friday?
DIANE: Yeah, I have to help my father.
LLOYD: Are you busy on Saturday?
DIANE: Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
LLOYD: So you're monumentally busy?
DIANE: Well, not monumentally.
LLOYD: What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
DIANE: Hmmm....
LLOYD: Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party. This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
DIANE: Actually, I think that I...
LLOYD: Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
DIANE: Well...
LLOYD: No tips. I won't give you any tips of any kind.
DIANE: I'll go.
LLOYD: Pardon me?
DIANE: I'll go.
LLOYD: You will? Excellent, alright, this is great. You will, really?
LLOYD: Alright. This is really great. Alright, we're going out. It's a date. It's a scam. Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
DIANE: Eight.
LLOYD: Eight. Eight O' clock.
DIANE: Goodbye.
LLOYD: Goodbye.
