Eating well while really depressed
I find it really hard to remember to eat since I don’t have the energy to cook and can’t afford to always eat out. I’ve been buying groceries and then I end up not being able to cook them and it they go bad. I really would like to reduce my food waste while still eating well because I know that’s important. I’ve got some things with protein, grains, and healthy fats that have been good but I’m really struggling with fruits and vegetables. Even just going through the effort to was and cut fruits and vegetables seems like too much. And I have a weird aversion to eating things without cutting them. Does anyone have any suggestions?

Tl;dr: Help me eat fruits and vegetables
