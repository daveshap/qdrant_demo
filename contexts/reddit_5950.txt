Online universities that turn hiring managers away?
As the title said, what online universities are frowned upon by hiring managers? I've looked into so many universities, but I never thought about how the degree might play into getting hired. Out of all the online universities I've looked into, Liberty University, Western Governors University, and Grand Canyon University are my top 3 picks that I would *like* to attend. I've read a lot of things about for-profit Christian schools (which I think LU and maybe GCU fall under) being something that hiring managers don't particularly like to see.

This is all assuming that I would have little to no experience and my only selling point is my degree.
