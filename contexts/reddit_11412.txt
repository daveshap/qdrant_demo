I'm scared...
I'm scared of my country, I live in Honduras, one of the most dangerous countries in the world. I sometimes think: "So many places in this world and I was born in this hell...  Why?" 

The police here is not very good, crime dominates everything here, criminals have no mercy here, they go mugging elders, teens, kids, mothers, anyone... It's ridiculous, I enjoy studying, I have a thirst for knowledge, I work hard in school to get good grades, but it's ridiculous that some day I may get killed by some random criminal that needs money, all the work I have done, would be gone, simple as that. 

Crimes remain unsolved here, every day in the news you see 15+ people that were killed.

I want to love this country, the people here are great. But there are more bad people in this country than good ones. It rages me how criminals can easily get away with their crimes without facing the law. 

Every day, I get scared I might lose a loved one because of some criminal. 
I'm scared about the future of this country, I'm scared about not being able to achieve my dreams because of the high murdering rate here, I'm scared of this country... 

However, I still have hope for humanity, I know there is always good somewhere, but it just so hard to find good here. 

That is all, this was more like a rant, but I had to get it out. 

Thanks to anyone that took the time to read this.
