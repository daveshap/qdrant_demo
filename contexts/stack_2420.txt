Is it acceptable to assume there will be no 'walk' in coordinates transformed back and forth between two datums? Given that you use the same datum transformation, you should end up with the same coordinate regardless of how many times you convert between to datums.  Is this a correct assumption?  Is this applicable for both equation-based and grid-based transformations?  For example: Convert NAD27 to NAD83 via NADCON then from those NAD83 to NAD27 via NADCON, and again, etc.
