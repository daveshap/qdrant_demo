PALMER: What kind of test?
MACREADY: I'm sure a lot of you already know.
MACREADY: Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down. Real tight.
CHILDS: What for?
MACREADY: For your health.
GARRY: Let's rush him. He's not going to blow us all up.
MACREADY: Damn if I won't.
CHILDS: You ain't tying me up.
MACREADY: Then I'll have to kill you.
CHILDS: Then kill me.
