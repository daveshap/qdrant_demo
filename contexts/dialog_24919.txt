NORMAN: I'm in psychology. Was. Still am really, just been a while. I treat aircrash survivors.
PILOT: Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
NORMAN: You've heard of me?
PILOT: Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
NORMAN: What report?
PILOT: Huh?
NORMAN: What report?
PILOT: You mean you don't know?
NORMAN: Know what?
PILOT: Must be another Johnson then. Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
NORMAN: Who's everyone?
PILOT: Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
NORMAN: Geologists? At a plane crash?
PILOT: Strange, isn't it? In the middle of the ocean no less.
NORMAN: What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
OFFICER: Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?
NORMAN: Just that. Careful, it's heavy.
OFFICER: No other equipment? Scientific instruments?
NORMAN: No, they didn't say --
OFFICER: This way, sir.
OFFICER: Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
NORMAN: Captain who?
OFFICER: Barnes. He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
NORMAN: Really?
OFFICER: By the way sir, I've read your report. I think it's brilliant.
NORMAN: What report?
OFFICER: You mean they haven't told you yet?
NORMAN: Told me what?
