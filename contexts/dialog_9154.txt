REED: He's made a few changes.
BEN: This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
REED: Victor's better at these things.

BEN: Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
DEBBIE: I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>. You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
