ME LAY: Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?
TRAPPER: Now?
HAWKEYE: Why can't you look at him?
ME LAY: I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
HAWKEYE: What's the story?
ME LAY: Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
HAWKEYE: What's wrong with him?
ME LAY: Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
TRAPPER: We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
ME LAY: But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
