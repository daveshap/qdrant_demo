HARRY: So he comes to L.A...
CHILI: I don't know about his wanting to meet celebrities, that's something new. But, yeah, he comes to L.A. Then after that, I don't know what happens.
HARRY: That's it? That's your movie?
CHILI: I said I had an idea, that's all.
HARRY: That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
CHILI: The shylock's the good guy.
HARRY: The shylock? He's barely mentioned. And it's not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast.
