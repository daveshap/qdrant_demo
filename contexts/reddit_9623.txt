What are some good alternative jobs for a Masters in Student Affairs degree?
Hi all! I've been struggling for 6 months to obtain a job in this field. My speciality is student activities and I've been a top 2 candidate 3 times with no luck and I'm getting very discouraged.

So, my question is, what are some other jobs/suggestions, that I could do with a Student Affairs degree?
