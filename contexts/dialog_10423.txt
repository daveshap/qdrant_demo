BILLY LEE: Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
WASHINGTON: Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
JOHN ADAMS: Washington is perfect. He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
SAM ADAMS: He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia. And, what in hell has he done for our cause? Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise! Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party! That's why New England loves him.
JOHN ADAMS: Hancock led the Boston 'tea party' because he's a goddamned tea smuggler! He wasn't protesting inequality, he was eliminating competition. Now, you listen to me: we need to get a Southerner elected commander-in-chief, or the south will not fight! What have we been struggling for all these years? For this moment! And, if we fail now, remember: you stopped us!
