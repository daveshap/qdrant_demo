Should I tell the recruiter for my first choice company that they're my first choice?
I currently have a stable job (thank goodness; I feel really lucky amidst this craziness) but it's seriously wearing at me and I intend to leave. 

Yesterday, a recruiter from AWS reached out to me on LinkedIn regarding a position which, according to Glassdoor, pays about 88% of what I'm making now. AWS is my first choice and I'm hoping to apply to a different position with them that would pay slightly more than what I'm making now and for which I'm suitably qualified.

I have a couple of questions that I'd love to hear this sub's thoughts on:

1. How do I best leverage the recruiter having reached out to me for a job other than the one I want? 
2. Does it hurt my eventual negotiating position to tell them that they're my first choice, but I'm not interested in the position they're trying to fill? 
3. Both positions would be in the same part of AWS (public sector consulting), so is it likely that the recruiter would already be aware of the position for which I intend to apply?
4. I'd rather not take a 12% pay cut, but is it worth it to get in the door?
