Feeling like his second choice
My boyfriend (22M) has an attractive female friend who he “loves” and will post “my fav” with her on his stories. He swears they’re just friends ever since (get this) they met on Tinder and she said she was just looking for friends. 

I (20F) think I already know I need to end things, we’ve only been together for a couple of weeks, and I just feel like a second choice to him. I’d rather not waste my energy and affection if I’m just a filler person to him, and to me he’s not. Am I right to feel this way? And how do I stop myself from texting him when I miss what we did have?

Edit: I’m alright looking, somebody once told me I look like fruitypoppin which is a rly nice compliment/if you want ref haha

Edit 2: I also met him on Tinder and he met her on there before he met me, so he wasn’t on there while he was with me :)
