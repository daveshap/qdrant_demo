I was just denied a job because of defaulted student loans after a credit check. Is this common?
I was all excited to leave my shitty line cook job, about to jump from 12.50/hr to between 15 and 17.25/hr with pretty decent benefits, working in a call center for a local bank. I nailed the interview, was called and told I had the job later that day on friday, now today I get a call saying the credit check showed my defaulted loans and I cant be hired per protocol and it is out of the managers hands even though they really liked me. I am in a loan rehab program but I am on payment 7 or 8 so maybe I havent made enough payments for them to officially come out of default. But still, I nearly put in my two weeks the other day and I would have looked like an ass or have been royally screwed. Is this a common thing for any job or is this mostly because I would have been working in a bank setting? Thanks!
