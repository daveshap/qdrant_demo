RIPLEY: This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
HUDSON: Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
RIPLEY: All right. There's a fire door at this end. The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
HICKS: We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
RIPLEY: That's right. So we put up welded barricades at these intersections... ...and seal these ducts here and here. Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
HICKS: Outstanding. Then all we need's a deck of cards. All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
HUDSON: Aye-firmative.
