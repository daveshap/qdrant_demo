LADY VAN TASSEL: Returning to the Western Woods?
ICHABOD: Yes, actually.
LADY VAN TASSEL: Use caution.
ICHABOD: Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
LADY VAN TASSEL: As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo. Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
