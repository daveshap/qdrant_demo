DOUG: You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
CHRIS: No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
DOUG: Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
CHRIS: I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
DOUG: Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
CHRIS: Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
DOUG: You got my word on it.
KATKA: Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
DOUG: Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
