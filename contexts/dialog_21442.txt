VIVIAN: Hi, Barney!
MR. THOMAS: Miss Vivian.
VIVIAN: Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
MR. THOMAS: Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
VIVIAN: Yeah, well, I check out today.
MR. THOMAS: You're not accompanying him to New York?
VIVIAN: Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world. You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
MR. THOMAS: Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian. John, call a limousine for our guest, please. Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go. Bill the hotel. See you again sometime soon.
