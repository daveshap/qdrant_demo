They hate and yell at me
My boss hates me and yells at me. It hurts a lot. I want to blind myself or break my neck so I do not have to work. That being said, I don't ever want to work for anyone again, everyone hates me and yells at me. 

No matter who they are, they all want to hurt me. I'm literally a worthless shit of a person. I asked them how are we going to keep this customer, and they told me I don't know, etc.  Funny bc they told me I was never allowed to say I don't know when I started. I really wanna die as a person, I truly failed. Its not that I always fail the customer (bc I sure as hell do that) it's that I fail everything I do and everything I will  do. 

I failed at socializing and communicating with others. I will absolutely never get another job after I'm let go from this one, or made to quit. And the worst part is, I never have in thirty years spoken to someone who didn't treat me like shit. 

I tried people pleasing, today I tried not people pleasing. And I'm hated all the same. I'm so lonely it physically hurts, the silence hurts. I just go to bed crying.
