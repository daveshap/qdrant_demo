IRIS: God, you are square.
TRAVIS: At least I don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy. I don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
IRIS: Who's a killer?
TRAVIS: That fella Sport" looks like a killer to me."
IRIS: He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
TRAVIS: Huh?
IRIS: I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
TRAVIS: He looks like a killer.
IRIS: I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
TRAVIS: He shoots dope too.
IRIS: What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
TRAVIS: He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
IRIS: Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
TRAVIS: I never been to a commune. I don't know. I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.
IRIS: Why don't you come to a commune with me?
TRAVIS: Me? I could never go to a place like that.
IRIS: Why not?
TRAVIS: I... I don't get along with people like that.
IRIS: You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
TRAVIS: Besides, I've got to stay here.
IRIS: Why?
TRAVIS: I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
IRIS: What's so important?
TRAVIS: I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
IRIS: You a narc?
TRAVIS: Do I look like a narc?
IRIS: Yeah.
IRIS: God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
TRAVIS: What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
IRIS: Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
TRAVIS: You just gonna leave 'em?
IRIS: What should I do? Call the cops?
TRAVIS: Cops don't do nothin.
IRIS: Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
TRAVIS: You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
IRIS: How?
TRAVIS: I don't know. Just should, though. Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
IRIS: God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
IRIS: You're not much with girls, are you?
TRAVIS: Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
IRIS: Do you really think I should go to the commune?
TRAVIS: I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
IRIS: Sure you don't want to come with me?
TRAVIS: I can't. Otherwise, I would.
IRIS: I sure hate to go alone...
TRAVIS: I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
IRIS: You don't have to.
TRAVIS: I want to -- what else can I do with my money? You may not see me again -- for a while.
IRIS: What do you mean?
TRAVIS: My work may take me out of New York.
