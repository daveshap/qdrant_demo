JULIET: O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
GLORIA: Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
JULIET: O God!--O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort nurse.
NURSE: Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
JULIET: Speakest thou from thy heart?
NURSE: And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
JULIET: Amen
NURSE: What?
JULIET: Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
