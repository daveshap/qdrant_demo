JOSH: Jesus, look at this guy.
ENID: Oh my God, that's HIM!
REBECCA: Are you sure?
ENID: Totally! Look!
ENID: He's insane!
REBECCA: We should follow him home.
JOSH: Forget it.
ENID: Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
JOSH: No.
ENID: But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
JOSH: You need counseling.
