VANESSA: What do we do now?
AUSTIN: We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag. You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
VANESSA: I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
AUSTIN: Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
VANESSA: I'll hurry back.
AUSTIN: Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
VANESSA: Austin, what's your point?
AUSTIN: Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
VANESSA: Oh, behave!
DR. EVIL: Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
SCOTT EVIL: I don't want to.
DR. EVIL: Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
SCOTT EVIL: Blow me.
DR. EVIL: What did you say?
SCOTT EVIL: Show me.
