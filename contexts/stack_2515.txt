Performing QGIS layer reprojection? I am very new to QGIS and GIS itself. I have a shapefile, which was created using Pulkovo 1995/GK zone 9(EPSG:20009) and I want to transform it to new CRS, specifically WGS84(EPSG:4326). So the main question is what is the best way to do so?I have tried to use the Reprojection Layer feature but the coordinates of my layer doesn't change, even if my CRS changed formally. For example: I am creating new project and define the project CRS as Pulkovo1995. Then I load the original layer and everything seems OK. In the next step I use Reprojection Layer and my layer disappears until I change the project CRS to WGS84. But the coordinates of the objects remains the same. I cannot see this layer on ESRI maps nor load it into Google Earth. Save As function doesn't help also.
