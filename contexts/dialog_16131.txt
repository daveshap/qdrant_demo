GEORGE: Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are. This is the end of it, Sam. I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
SAM: Don't. I don't want it.
GEORGE: Do whatever you want with it. I don't care. All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
SAM: We haven't build shit. You're just tearing down your father.
GEORGE: Try it. It feels good.
