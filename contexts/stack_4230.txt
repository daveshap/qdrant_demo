The pros and cons of thermokinesis I am currently working on a magic system that involves Thermokinesis, which is the ability to manipulate temperature. This power involves controlling the rate of movement of molecules, which is involved in the definition of thermal energy. This means the user could manipulate the wind, the density of water and to some extent, the earth.The question is can the human body withstand instantaneous temperature changes, if for example you wished to become extremely dense to withstand a punch to the face, or gut? What are the potential consequences of withstanding kinetic blows?
