Were extracurricular activities a big worry in high school?
On the start of 9th grade I decided to do art and debate, and quit orchestra. I quit debate right after the first tournament. I'm a sophomore now and I only have art, which I have won some awards for, but because it doesn't have any tournaments like sports or debate, I feel like I'm not achieving anything. I can't go a day without thinking that I'm not good enough and that I shouldn't have quit anything. Other kids have friends from band and dance or whatever sport they play, and I find myself just home drawing and doing schoolwork. I don't know if anyone else thinks this way; did you have regrets/worries about extracurriculars, or am I just being weird?
