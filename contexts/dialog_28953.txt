DENBY: Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
MARY: I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
DENBY: But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
MARY: Somebody's got to do it--
DENBY: Well, let's hear the poem--
MARY: Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
DENBY: Very good, Mary--
MARY: But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
DENBY: What's the matter, Mary?
MARY: I'm getting seasick--
DENBY: H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
MARY: Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
DENBY: Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
