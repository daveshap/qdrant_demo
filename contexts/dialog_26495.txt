JOR-EL: It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
LARA: -- as we will be.
JOR-EL: Lara, please...
LARA: But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
JOR-EL: They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
LARA: A million years behind us. Jor-El, he's only a baby.
JOR-EL: Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
LARA: He'll be weightless.
JOR-EL: Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong. He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
LARA: He will be odd, different.
JOR-EL: Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
