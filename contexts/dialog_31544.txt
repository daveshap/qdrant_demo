ZUKOVSKY: In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
CHRISTMAS: What class sub does your nephew run?
ZUKOVSKY: C-class.
BOND: Nuclear.
CHRISTMAS: Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor. He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
BOND: Made to look just like an accident.
ZUKOVSKY: Mother of God.
BOND: The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
CHRISTMAS: But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
BOND: Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
CHRISTMAS: The King pipeline.
BOND: Elektra would control it all.
