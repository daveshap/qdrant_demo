CONNELL: I can read. I can read!
ANN: Sorry.
CONNELL: So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
ANN: Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
CONNELL: Packs everything, including a gun. Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
POP: Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut and—I'll eat him.
CONNELL: Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time. Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appear—and in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
CONNELL: Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
TALL CHAP: No, I didn't.
CONNELL: What are you doing up here then?
TALL CHAP: Well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. Thought there might be one left over.
ANN: Had any schooling?
TALL CHAP: Yeah, a little.
ANN: What do you do when you work?
TALL CHAP: I used to pitch.
ANN: Baseball?
TALL CHAP: Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
ANN: Where'd you play?
TALL CHAP: Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.
CONNELL: How about family? Got any family?
TALL CHAP: No.
CONNELL: Oh, just traveling through, huh?
TALL CHAP: Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
CONNELL: Looks all right—
ANN: He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
CONNELL: I wish he had a family, though.
