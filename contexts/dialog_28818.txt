POOCH: You got it.
GLASS: We work fast enough for you?
REILLY: T.J., what're you doing?
T.J.: My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
T.J.: So what're we looking for?
REILLY: Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
T.J.: In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
GLASS: How long are we going to stay?
REILLY: `Til we get a better lead.
POOCH: Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
REILLY: Insurance?
GLASS: Political.
POOCH: Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not.
GLASS: Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
REILLY: What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
GLASS: Right.
REILLY: Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
