COOCH: Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
CROW HORSE: Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
RAY: This is a restricted area.
COOCH: Check him out, Ray.
COOCH: Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
CROW HORSE: It ain't Geronimo.
COOCH: Who are you?
CROW HORSE: I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
COOCH: I know where I am. I'm on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you don't wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. It's your call. Who are you?
CROW HORSE: I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
COOCH: You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
RAY: I did.
COOCH: Who the fuck is he?
RAY: -- a fucking cop.
