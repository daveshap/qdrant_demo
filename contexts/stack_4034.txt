Air ticket compensation for changed flight The departure time for my flight from Vienna to Lisbon (TAP) was changed from 13h15 to 18h30 (also the flight number changed). I was informed 2 days before departure about this by text message, but no reason was mentioned.Does this situation count as a delayed flight (5h15 late) and am I entitled for any compensation (e.g. miles, discount on next flight, etc...)?If the latter, where in Portugal should I apply for a compensation?
