Should a 19 yr old be able to sleep over at her boyfriend's house?
Here's the situation: Tomorrow is my boyfriend's birthday and he lives an hour away. I don't have a car, but my mother and I are going to the same town the same day because we have an optometrist appointment in the afternoon. She can easily drop me off at my boyfriend's place but she would have nothing to do for the rest of the day/night while I spend it with him and have dinner with his family. My most convenient ride home would be my dad. He works and commutes in the same city at night, so he can take me back home in the morning. We haven't spoken about it yet, but she said "Hey I think we need to talk" so i'm assuming she isn't okay with me sleeping at my boyfriend's...if that's the case she's going to wait and find something she doesn't really need to do until i'm done. That's just illogical, if my dad could easily take me home.

I go to college and am only home for the summer. While in college I had the freedom to make my own decisions based on what I believed was right and wrong without any sort of control from my parents. I believe that it should be okay for me to go stay over at my boyfriends house because (and my parents are aware of these) I went on a lake trip with him and his family and we stayed at their house, I visited my boyfriend just last weekend and wouldn't have stayed anywhere else since I was with him the whole time. I'm 19 and he's 20, we've been dating for about a year now.

How can I communicate with my mom to get her to understand that though she may not agree that it's okay, she needs to respect my decision? How else can I support my argument?
