Life is like a video game you don't want to play anymore or a book you don't want to read anymore.
The idea of suicide feels like pressing the pause/stop button on a video game. After sometime you just don't feel like playing the game anymore. You don't stop playing a video game or stop reading a book because of depression or loneliness. You stop simply because you don't wish to carry on. It could be because of boredom/repetitiveness. It could be because of the high difficulty. Of course you could start playing a different game or you could read a different book but can we do that in real life? Does anyone feel the same way?
