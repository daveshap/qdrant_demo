Error creating connection pool for dbid: We have an application that uses TomCat and Java to receive files and move them to a SQL Server 2012 instance.  Previous versions of this software worked just fine.  The new release fails on our system with the error <blockquote>  Error creating connection pool for dbid:</blockquote>Many hours have been spent adjusting the configuration to get past this error with no positive result.  Any insight on what the error means and how it might be traced would be appreciated.
