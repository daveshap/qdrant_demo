Hammer Editor - \"Unexpected End of File\" On Load, Reading Chunks 33% First of all, I know questions similar to this have been answered, but yet I cannot find the solution.I was saving my map after doing some stuff with logic entities. Upon saving, Hammer quit without any message. Upon attempted loading, Hammer comes up with \"File C:...mapname.vmf, line 18838: unexpected end of file\with another window saying \"Loading Chunks...\" Then 33%. I have read that editing the .vmf file to add a curly bracket } at the end to close the whatever it's called. I found mine was missing one, so I added it, now when ever I open the same map it loads to 33% again, then crashes, all in under a second.So, simply: Any solutions? Also, I am using the Hammer Editor with HL2 in the base.It's kind of sad I have to write this one about 2 hours after my other H.E question.
