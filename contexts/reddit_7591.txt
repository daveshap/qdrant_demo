longterm relationships within and after grad schools
# in happy longterm relationships, what resulting qualities or skills are more valuable than learning how to solve problems creatively? and why? what evidence supports your response?

**heres a quick example of sovling porbelms creatively:**

* before the laundry machine was invented, a big kind of a problem was girls didnt have much free time to do anything like develop hobbies or run for ceo prime minster president director of aircraft engineering etc
* i dont know the history of the invention of laundry machine but automating this process of cleaning clothes  in total saved time for ppl in general
* this was a way of solving a problem that nobody thought about
* creatively = outside of what is the norm at any given point in time

in happy longterm relationships, what resulting qualities or skills are more valuable than learning how to solve problems creatively? and why? what evidence supports your response?

for example say the couple had the quality of cooperation, the question is why does that quality matter and what does it lead to? cooperation along with otehr qualities would be a precursor to creative problem solving

* the end result of what things lead \[to\] is what are    **resulting qualities or skills**
* i cant think of a better phrase atm
* see [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/asmvxc/til\_a\_harvard\_study\_found\_that\_hiring\_one\_highly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/asmvxc/til_a_harvard_study_found_that_hiring_one_highly/)

other possible options i thoguht about for things that are more important than solving problems creatively are:

* **being open**\- being to new thoughts, and new ideas (that are based on good evidence and reason ofc), but thinking about it, this actually is just one of the many prerequisites to being able to solve problems creatively
* **loving the ideals & going towards the ideals**\- even if a couple had this if they didnt know how to solve porbelms creativly i dont see how this would be more important than solving porbelms creativly
* **initiative in starting new things**\- showing leadership stuff like that, umm i dont where i would place this in what is valuable, but its def not  more important than solving porbelms creativly
   * but maybe it actually is more importnt tho gotta tink abojt this one
* **compromise**\- ok this is really bad, and this is a large reason why solving porbelms creaitlvey is so much better
   * compromise = to give up something you care about and/or selfish about
   * compromise is really bad cos its \[not\] creating more value or more wealth in society, for example there's 1 pizza, to compromise theere's still gonna be 1 pizza at the end no matter, well i guess there'll be no pizza which is worst
   * or rent, landowners that rent from residents arent creating any extra value, the value is still the same at the end usually.
      * same goes the residents, they arent imporoving they arent making anything better
* **being thoughtful-** i dunn o what this word means its too vague and i dont know hwo to descibe it using words so there's no way to compare and see it was more important than being able to solve problems creatively cos i dun even know wat this means to be 'thoughtful'
* etc other things somewhere... duno where i put them..  cant think of anything else off top of mind atm
