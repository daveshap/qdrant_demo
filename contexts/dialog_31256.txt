BOOK: Now what's the problem?
RACHEL: The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
BOOK: Whacking?
RACHEL: Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
BOOK: Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
RACHEL: We do not go into your courts.
BOOK: People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
BOOK: Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
RACHEL: No you're not â€“ You're glad, because now you've got a witness. I heard the other police talking last night. They don't seem to like you very much.
BOOK: They kid a lot.
RACHEL: I would not be too sure.
