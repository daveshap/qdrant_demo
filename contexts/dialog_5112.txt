KAYLEIGH: Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
TOMMY: I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
KAYLEIGH: Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
TOMMY: I thought I was the bad guy!
KAYLEIGH: You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
EVAN: We're really gonna be in a movie!?
MR. MILLER: That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
