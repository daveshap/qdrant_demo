Wifi disconnects after certain time I have installed ubuntu 17.04 in my haier laptop. But the wifi disconnects after certain time and I have to reboot every time for it to work again and the same happens again after some time. I also had it installed on one of my other laptop and there wasn't any issue thier. Maybe it has something to do with this laptop, but I was using windows prior to that and everything was absolutely fine. I have tried many solutions from internet but nothing has worked for me
