NED: We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
MUNNY: Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
NED: How long since you shot a gun at a man? Nine... ten years?
MUNNY: Eleven.
NED: Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans. Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
MUNNY: We done stuff before for money, Ned.
NED: Well, we thought we was doin' it for money... What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
MUNNY: Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
NED: Well, I guess they got it comin'... But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
