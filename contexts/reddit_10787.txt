Existing is exhausting.
  I'm so tired of waking up, day in, day out. Seeing the sun doesn't make feel grateful or energized for the next "bright new day". It doesn't make me think of fresh starts and "every moment is a chance to turn it all around". 
  Everytime I see the sun, I just feel my whole being shrink away. It's too bright and somehow makes an already overstimulating world, louder and faster.
 Like a sick animal, I just want to find a quiet hole to crawl away into and die; isolated from everything and everyone around me. 
  I only exist for my sister's sake but there's no way to exist for myself as well. I am a worthless, useless and pathetic excuse for a 30 year old human being with nothing to offer anyone. 

I'm so tired of being alive. I just want the noise in my head to stop.
