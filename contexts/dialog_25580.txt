THREEPIO: Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187. She's still alive...
LUKE: Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
BEN: That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately. Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time. I hope you can remember everything.
HAN: We'll be back before you are, old man.
BEN: May the Force be with you.
