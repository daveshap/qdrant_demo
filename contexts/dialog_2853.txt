HARDY: I pushed him too hard.
OSBORNE: You couldn't have known --
HARDY: Yeah, I could've. Should've.
OSBORNE: You wanted to get the truth.
HARDY: No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
OSBORNE: You mean the falsely accused?
OSBORNE: You wanted to break him.
HARDY: Yeah.
OSBORNE: So did I.
STYLES: It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.
HARDY: That's horseshit and you know it.
STYLES: Maybe. But it's my fault and I'll carry it.
