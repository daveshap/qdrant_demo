Does a File's Checksum Change after it is Digitally Signed? From my understanding, when you digitally sign a file, it changes that file's checksum because they are bundled together.Example of what I mean:<blockquote>  file1.txt only contains the letter 'd' and the crc32 checksum of this file is 98dd4acc. However, I want to digitally sign it using my certificates private key. After I digitally sign it, what is the hash of the file? Does it remain the same as 98dd4acc or does it change after its bundled with the certificate?</blockquote>Am I right or wrong in assuming the checksum of the file will change? Is a digital signature not actually included in the file itself but instead included in the properties or something.Thank you.
