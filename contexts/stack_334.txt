Can\u2018t setup an iPad or Apple TV as Home Hub I tried a lot of different things and running out of ideas. I wanted to start using the HomeKit and failed to setup a Home Hub, both with my Apple TV 4 and with my iPad. My Apple ID is setup with Two-Factor-Authentication and Keychain enabled. Home is switch on my iPhone and iPad. I also rebooted the devices several times and signed off and on e.g. in the Apple TV. I use latest OS versions. HomeKit does not show up in Apple TV and if I set to use the iPad a Home Hub, nothing changes.All Home applications on iPad, iPhone or Mac indicated that remote access is not set up and suggest to setup a home hub.Anything you see that I missed?
