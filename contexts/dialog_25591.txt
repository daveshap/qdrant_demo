BLUE LEADER: You're Starkiller?
LUKE: Yes, sir.
BLUE LEADER: Have you been checked out?
LUKE: Yes, sir. I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
BLUE LEADER: Six hours, huh? Well, that's your ship there. You're blue five. You stay glued to me. I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this. This is no joy ride we're going on.
LUKE: Yes, sir.
