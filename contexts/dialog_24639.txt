VENZA: How do I know that's her?
MIKE: I'll bring her in. You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
VENZA: Why should she come in?
MIKE: She trusts me. She'll do what I say.
VENZA: Bullshit! Prove it.
MIKE: Koontz! Let her come in! Claire! It's pitch dark in here! You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall. Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
MIKE: I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
VENZA: I get my hostage first. No one's turned loose until I say so.
MIKE: Let my kid go.
VENZA: I'm not lettin' no one go.
MIKE: Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in! Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up! Put him under the table!
VENZA: Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
MIKE: Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
VENZA: Under the table.
MIKE: I'll take his place, all right? Put the gun to my head.
