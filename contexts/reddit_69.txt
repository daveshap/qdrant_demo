I’m failing math and it could ruin my entire high school plan! What do I do?
I have tried in math. I have a tutor, I go extra help in lunch but every test I fail. I’m going to fail math and then I’ll have to retake it in the summer. I don’t want to waste my last summer of high school on math. Please I need some advice, what do I do, I can’t fail.
