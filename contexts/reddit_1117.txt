I GOT A JOB!
The past 6 months my agoraphobia had gotten so bad that I avoided leaving my house completely. A few days ago I decided to start applying for jobs. I had an interview today and after having 2 panic attacks about it and fighting my fears for hours, I went. 

The interview went so well that they wanted me to fill a different position that would be way more interesting, pay more, and I’d have my own office. I was hired on the spot. 

Needed to share this with somewhere. Don’t have a lot of friends lol:)

Update: 
Thank you for the silver❤️ I had my first day today and it was awesome. My manager is great.
