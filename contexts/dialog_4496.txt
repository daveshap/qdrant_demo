DIGNAN: See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
ANTHONY: This was in fourth grade.
DIGNAN: Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
ANTHONY: After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
DIGNAN: They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
ANTHONY: But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
DIGNAN: Yes... It's true.
