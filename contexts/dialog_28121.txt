DEBORAH: Mr Lombard?
LOMBARD: Have you got a pen?
DEBORAH: Just a moment... Go ahead.
LOMBARD: The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
DEBORAH: ...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
LOMBARD: Are you all right?
DEBORAH: Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
LOMBARD: Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I’ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up. If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
DEBORAH: Paul Lamont...?
LOMBARD: Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
EFFEMINATE WAITER: Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
LOMBARD: A coffee and a couple of croissants.
EFFEMINATE WAITER: Crow what?
LOMBARD: Croissants.
EFFEMINATE WAITER: I’m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
LOMBARD: Croissants. Like that...
