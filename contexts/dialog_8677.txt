CLEMENTINE: Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
JOEL: I remember that speech really well.
CLEMENTINE: I had you pegged, didn't I?
JOEL: You had the whole human race pegged.
CLEMENTINE: Probably.
JOEL: I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
CLEMENTINE: I know.
JOEL: It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
CLEMENTINE: Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
JOEL: Thanks, guys.
CARRIE: I hope you feel better, sweetie.
JOEL: Yeah.
CARRIE: Say hi to Naomi.
