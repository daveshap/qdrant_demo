RONA: Hey, darlin'.
TOM: Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
RONA: I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
TOM: You're looking fit.
RONA: Fit? You want to check my teeth. Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
TOM: If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
RONA: Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
TOM: Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
