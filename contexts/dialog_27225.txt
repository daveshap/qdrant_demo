TRUMAN: Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
MERYL: That's not true.
MERYL: Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink? All natural. Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
TRUMAN: --What the hell are you talking about?!
MERYL: I've tasted other cocoas. This is the best.
TRUMAN: What the hell has that got to do with anything? Tell me what's happening?!
MERYL: You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
TRUMAN: You're part of this, aren't you?!
