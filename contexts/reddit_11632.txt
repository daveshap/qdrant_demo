Some douchebag stole the seat off my bike.
They didn't even try to steal my bike. They just took the seat. It's cruel and unusual and I fucking hate people sometimes. Assholes just don't understand what the fuck it feels like when your bike or a piece of it gets stolen. It's fucking horrible. That shit's my only mode of transportation and now I have to fucking walk everywhere or take the bus. Whatever. I hope that person gets what's coming to them. Karma is a bitch.
