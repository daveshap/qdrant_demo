Is my.peoplematter legit?
I put in an online app at a chain pizza place and got an email to do a background check. It linked me to a site called "my.peoplematter" I put my info but used a different password/pin number that I haven't used on anything else and now it's asking for my social and drives license number. I'm a little sketched out to put that info on a site I've never used/heard of. Anyone have any experience with it?
