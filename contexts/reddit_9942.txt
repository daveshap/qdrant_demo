Help with Deciding a Right Path
Hey everyone,

I just found this subreddit, and I am grateful that I was able to find like-minded people who are interested in discussing issues that are part of Student Affairs. I am extremely interested in getting into the realm of Student Affairs in Higher Education in the future, and I am hoping that some of you could lend a hand to help me achieve my endeavors.

A bit about me: I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in Political Science. I decided that I wanted to continue studying Political Science and ultimately teach as a professor, so I decided to enroll in graduate school after a year off. I moved to my new school with all my belongings, but I came to the realization that Political Science was not for me during the second week of class, so I decided to drop out of the program. I came to the realization that I was truly interested in Student Affairs at a community college, and in a way, I always felt this way since my time as a student leader at my community college. I observed what my former advisor worked on and his responsibilities and the more that I thought about it, the more I wanted to be part of the field. In the future, I hope to be a Director of Student Affairs.

Basically, I am unsure of what I should do right now. In a way, I felt like I wasted my time and energy moving to a new school for my graduate program, only to withdraw from the university because I was no longer interested in pursuing a Master's degree in Political Science. At this moment, I am applying to community college jobs, specifically as a Transfer Specialist to help students with the transferring process. 

My question to all of you is: Is this the right path to take?

Thanks for listening and I really appreciate the help!
