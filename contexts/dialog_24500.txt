RHEYA: You want to fuck her?
KELVIN: Stop it.
RHEYA: You behave as though you want to fuck her.
KELVIN: Rheya. Not here.
RHEYA: And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening. Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on? Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
KELVIN: Let's go home.
RHEYA: You go home.
KELVIN: I am. Please come with me. I don't want to do this here.
RHEYA: You talk like an actor.
