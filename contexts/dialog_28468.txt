ANDREW: How are you?
WYNANT: Another young man.
ANDREW: It's the same one.
DOROTHY: It's been the same one for three months.
WYNANT: Forgive me. How are you?
DOROTHY: Take a good look at him, Dad. Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
WYNANT: Well!
ANDREW: That is, if it's all right with you.
WYNANT: And if it isn't?
DOROTHY: He'll still be your son-in-law!
WYNANT: You see how much we have to say.
DOROTHY: Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
ANDREW: Mind if I look around?
WYNANT: Help yourself. Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
WYNANT: Where are you going?
TOM: Home!
WYNANT: Home?
TOM: I'm fired.
WYNANT: Who fired you?
TOM: You did.
