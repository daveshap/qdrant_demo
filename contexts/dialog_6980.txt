JENNIFER: You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
FRIDA: I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
JENNIFER: Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
FRIDA: No you don't, believe me.
FRIDA: Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!
JENNIFER: No they're not.
FRIDA: Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
JENNIFER: It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
FRIDA: I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
CARLTON: No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
GEORGE: Jennifer gave her a make-over.
CARLTON: Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
CARLTON: Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
FRIDA: I've changed a lot lately.
FRIDA: You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
CARLTON: Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
FRIDA: No.
CARLTON: James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
FRIDA: Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
CARLTON: Yeah but they looked cool...
