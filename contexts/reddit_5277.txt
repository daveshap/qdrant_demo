Game Dev graduate struggling to practice, stay motivated and find work.
Hi all,

So as the title states I'm a Gave Dev graduate with a BSc with honours at a 2:1 level living in Scotland. I graduated a year ago and felt pretty good. 

Issue is since then I've been working jobs with tiring hours that have me working with customers, one as a receptionist at a holiday park, now working in a bank call centre.

Since then I've never had energy to program, 3D model or do any level design, applying to any tech position scares me and I just feel like I'm getting in my own way. I've felt for a long time that I've managed to get through Uni through flukes but having left that feels stronger than ever before, especially with the companies I've applied to never getting back to me bar one who sent me a test. A test that brought me to tears over not knowing anything about it.

Does anyone have any advice to getting into tech jobs? As well as pushing past your fear and getting back into a pattern of learning more and practicing more? Thanks!
