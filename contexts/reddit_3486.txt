Insight: When someone says they don’t want a relationship or a relationship “right now” it really means a relationship with you
EDIT 2 and DISCLAIMER: Yes, this doesn’t apply 100% of the times. Just like with every other general advice take it with a grain of salt and assess how it works in your situation.

ORIGINAL POST:

Take it from someone doing it right now. If you are dating and meeting new people you may get with someone whom you click with either sexually or have fun BUT not  necessarily want a relationship with.  

Not wanting a relationship “right now” only really means “not with you”. 

Yes there are occasions where this isn’t true and the person doesn’t want to be in a relationship period, but most of the times it means they are waiting for someone else (sometimes someone they haven’t met but an archetype different than you). 

The best you can do is not waste your time and move on or accept it will go nowhere and enjoy it.

As for me I am pretty open towards the beginning what type of relationship I see myself having with the other person so there are no confusions.

EDIT: To the dozen people saying “not always”: It’s right there in the third paragraph. I already said is not always the case but in general terms this applies.
