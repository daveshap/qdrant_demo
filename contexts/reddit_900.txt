does anyone else’s anxiety cause them to speak really fast and finish people’s sentences, leading to really weird conversations that don’t last long?
Personally, it’s like I can never just relax and let the conversation flow naturally. 

Sometimes I mumble my replies as well like I’m not confident enough to make my words audible, so that’s also pretty weird. It’s like I know I’m being weird but I physically cannot stop.
