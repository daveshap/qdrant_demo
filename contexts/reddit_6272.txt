Is poor job training pretty common now?
My current job has a high caseload and sink or swim training. 

This article describes my current situation really well:

Everyone is nice so far but I specifically told them during the interview that I didn't want this kind of training style and they assured me that I would have more formal training. It's pretty big company too.

Starting to see why this decent paying job has a high turnover. I researched the company and the issues didn't concern me too much at the time but nothing indicated poor training until I actually started.

Is this issue pretty rampant now? This is my second office job with this kind of training. I'm extremely stressed out, struggling with all the deadlines and annoyed clients. I'm trying my best including working overtime. My only source of learning is pretty much to "ask someone".
