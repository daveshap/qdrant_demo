How to get into the Movie Industry?
As the title says, I’m in my Junior Year of Highschool and haven’t signed up for Senior Year classes or chose a College, as the title says, I’d like to work in the Movie Industry, more specifically a director. I was wondering if anyone here would be able to give me some advice on which classes to take or skills to improve on?
