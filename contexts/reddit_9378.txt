I just got a bonus for the next 8 weeks that almost doubles my pay!
Between still waiting on ue and being out of work for a month, then coming back to work, worrying that once unemployment kicks in, i would be making more from that than my paycheck, i needed this. I clean cars for a living so its hard to consider myself essential. But i can't turn down a paycheck, so when i was called back in, i knew i had to make the best of it. A huge weight has just been lifted from life for me. At least for the time being!

Good luck all and stay safe!!
