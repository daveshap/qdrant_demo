MAC: The Empress Death Mask.
GIN: The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
GIN: Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
MAC: That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
GIN: I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
MAC: It's not for sale.
GIN: I know.
MAC: So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
GIN: But Roki said--
MAC: Roki has a vivid imagination.
MAC: Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
GIN: You can't.
MAC: Oh?
GIN: It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
