MADELEINE: You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
SCOTTIE: I... didn't know where you lived.
MADELEINE: You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
SCOTTIE: Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
MADELEINE: No, you are right, I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you... Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
SCOTTIE: My name is John Ferguson.
MADELEINE: That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
SCOTTIE: John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
MADELEINE: I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
SCOTTIE: No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
MADELEINE: I prefer John. There, that's done. And what do you do, John?
SCOTTIE: Wander about.
MADELEINE: That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
MADELEINE: One shouldn't live alone.
SCOTTIE: Some people prefer it.
MADELEINE: No... it's wrong.
