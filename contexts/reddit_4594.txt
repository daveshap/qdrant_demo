I just don't care anymore. I've pretended to be happy for 8 years now and its fucking killed me.
I want to pretend like I'm happy and i actually matter but I just don't see the point. I've broken or ruined every thing and relationship I've ever had and it was always my fault. Anytime I get angry I hit something. Ironic as I'm scared of confrontation and can only take out my anger on inanimate objects. 

I don't know why but I feel like everything's getting worse even though just a couple days ago I could keep up the facade no problem. Everyday it's the same vision, I can't stop it and it terrifies me. It starts with me just looking down at a knife and I just put it right in my throat. it's only been different like 6 times and instead of stabbing myself I shoot someone I considered a great friend for 5 years. I don't even know what I think of him anymore and I can't say the thought of him dying hurts me because truly I couldn't care less.

I've been thinking recently and I realized I've never actually done something good in my life so I understand why my life has been this way. No one has ever turned out better because they met me, the best thing they do for themselves is never talking to me again.
