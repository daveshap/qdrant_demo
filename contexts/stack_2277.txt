Can\u2019t become Thane of Falkreath So I was achievement hunting Skyrim, and I have to buy 3 plots of land for one of the achievements. Dawnstar, Morthal, and Falkreath. I have to help citizens of all 3 of these holds. One citizen, \u201cHert\u201d, is a citizen that works at Half Moon Mill. To help her, you must chop wood. However, for the Dawnguard quest line, I was required to kill her. I\u2019ve saved up a little over 100,000 Gold on my current save, I\u2019ve fully upgraded the Dawnstar home, and I\u2019m at level 62. I killed Hert around level 13. So I don\u2019t want to make another save just for 1 achievement. Is there anyway to become Thane of Falkreath if Hert is dead?
