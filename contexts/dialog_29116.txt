FIRST OFFICER: A dead head. Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west. Muncy! Engines to half!
HELMSMAN: Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
FIRST OFFICER: Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
