GUENEVERE: The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
LANCELOT: No.
GUENEVERE: Why?
LANCELOT: I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
GUENEVERE: And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
LANCELOT: There is one.
GUENEVERE: Who?!
LANCELOT: You.
GUENEVERE: Me?
LANCELOT: Yes. I would swear my love to you.
GUENEVERE: To me? But why?
LANCELOT: I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
