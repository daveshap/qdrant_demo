JACK: Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
HUDGEONS: Where'd you hear that?
JACK: Around.
HUDGEONS: Jackie, all I know is what you know. The man is very rich. And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer. But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.' He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
