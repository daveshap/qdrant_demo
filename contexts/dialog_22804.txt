DANNY: Yeah. Pretty sure. Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
TANNER: God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
DANNY: Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
TANNER: Danny, I'm touched.
DANNY: Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
GARCETTI: Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
DANNY: Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
GARCETTI: I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch. You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
DANNY: Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
