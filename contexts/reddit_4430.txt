How can we seek help while the rest of the world is shutting down?
Depression is difficult enough on its own, but with the ongoing Coronavirus scare, human interaction is getting far more limited by the day. Even my psychiatrist is only doing appointments online for the next 8 weeks. Being stuck at home with nowhere to go and nobody to see is the perfect recipe for suicidal ideation. 

How can those already suffering stay hopeful when so many resources are very limited? What can stop someone from wanting to kill themselves when the world is in crisis mode itself?
