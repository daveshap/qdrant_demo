Does anyone else get EXTREMELY nauseous sometimes due to anxiety.
Sometimes I get so anxious in certain situations I literally could vomit. Sometimes I actually have and idk why this happens? In my brain I’m like “ok I’m good nothing bad is here” but my body just gets the WORST nausea I’ve ever experienced. Does this happen to anyone else? And how can I fix it?
