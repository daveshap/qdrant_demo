Can I re-enter Italy with Carta di identit\u00e0 and Carta di soggiorno? I am an Indian citizen, married to an Italian. I have both the Carta di identit\u00e0 and the Carta di soggiorno as a family member of an EU citizen. I want to travel to India to visit my family for one month. When I leave India to re-enter Italy, do I need a Schengen visa or can I board my flight with my Italian family card?
