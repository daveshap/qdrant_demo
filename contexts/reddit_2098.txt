Boys itâ€™s been an honor
Got rejected once... twice... thrice? (is that even a word)... anyways I got rejected by almost all the schools I thought I could get into. Got rejected by UCLA (parents went there), UCI, UCSB, Vandy, Northeastern, UVA, etc. I was crushed I got waitlisted to my dream school: Notre Dame. I was content with that. I didnâ€™t even check my ivy decision; honestly, I didnâ€™t care and didnâ€™t expect much. I applied to Yale and Harvard for the shits and giggles. Because my parents asked me to, I decided to open them. I opened Yale, got rejected. Then I half heartily opened Harvard... I FUXKING GOT IN!!!!!! MIRACLES DO HAPPEN. Donâ€™t loose hope guysðŸ¥³
