BARON: Bless you...
GRUSINSKAYA: Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
BARON: I can't.
GRUSINSKAYA: No?
BARON: No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
GRUSINSKAYA: Why do you think --
BARON: Why?
GRUSINSKAYA: They've brought me such good luck -- you --
GRUSINSKAYA: I'm worried about you.
BARON: Don't.
GRUSINSKAYA: On the train?
BARON: Yes -- I will be on the train.
GRUSINSKAYA: Till then.
BARON: Bless you --
KRINGELEIN: Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
BARON: Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
KRINGELEIN: If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
BARON: What?
KRINGELEIN: I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
BARON: If I could get into a game I might win some.
KRINGELEIN: Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
BARON: If we could scare up some men to play.
KRINGELEIN: We could come to my room.
BARON: Good!
BARON: Going?
FLAEMMCHEN: Yes --
BARON: Ready, Kringelein?
KRINGELEIN: Ready, Baron.
