Intrusive Thoughts - My Technique For Banishing Them
Crossposted from Depression.

OK, first off, I am not a doctor. I'm just a guy who has been dealing with his own depression for the last 40+ years.

One of my most persistent symptoms is the host of intrusive thoughts I get. Specifically, the ones where your brain makes you ruminate on painful or embarrassing things that happened in your past. It's like you can't help but have to sit there and relive it over and over again. It's been the toughest thing for me to get rid of.

Anyway, I finally realized that I needed to break the cycle, and...to make along story short...I have a technique that actually seems to work. I've been using it for the past couple of months, and for this particular symptom, it seems to work pretty well.

First off, the tough parts. You have to be **willing** to stop the cycle...you can get addicted to it without realizing it. Then, you have to start **realizing** that you are doing it, and try to realize it *as close to the moment that you start doing it*. I'm not kidding when I say that this is the toughest part, mostly because it means diverting your behavior into something that is new to you (which is never easy). If you can do this, you really are halfway there.

Next, you tell yourself that you don't have to live in that moment, but instead have to live in the NOW. Nobody can change the past, so you don't need to worry about it anymore. Nobody is keeping score but you, and you don't have any reason to continue doing it. This should be a little bit jarring, like it's shaking you awake, but embrace the startling aspect of it.

Finally, in this moment...distract yourself. Look for anything else to think about besides the intrusive thought that you were thinking about originally. This will keep you from immediately sliding back into the old pattern. I have found that, for me, thinking of a bunch of shallow topics in succession will do the trick. "That's a pretty tree. Hey, I'm coming up on Main Street. That car has Florida plates. My feet are very warm right now. There's a grade school. I wonder what their mascot is." ...You get the idea. Keep it up for a full minute if you can.

That's it, that's all there is to it. It took longer to explain it than it typically takes to do it (once you get good at realizing when it happens).

Maybe this has been done before, and the technique has already been invented. I honestly don't know, nor is it particularly important to me. I just want to put this out there in the hope that it might help someone else like it helped me.
