LESTAT: You fool, what have you done?
LOUIS: What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
LOUIS: Where are we?
LESTAT: Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
LOUIS: We belong in hell.
LESTAT: And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
MALLOY: You loved Yvette...
LOUIS: Can a vampire feel love?
MALLOY: You loved your wife, surely.
LOUIS: I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
