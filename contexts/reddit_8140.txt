Senator Kennedy asked Peterson to define legal terms during his confirmation hearing. Where they obscure questions, or should a reasonably-qualified person have known how to answer them?
I have no idea what a *motion in limine*, *the Daubert standard*, *the Pullman abstention doctrine*, or *the Younger abstention doctrine* are ... but I'm not a legal expert so it's understandable.

[Are criticisms leveled against Peterson fair?](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-judicial-nominee-cant-answer_us_5a3357d2e4b01d429cc76802?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009) That is to say: Are those terms & doctrines something a reasonably-qualified judge should have known by-rote - or was Kennedy was asking obscure questions that even a legal expert would have had trouble with?
