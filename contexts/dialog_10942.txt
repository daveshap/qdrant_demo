COMMODUS: You and my father have become very close. Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
NARCISSUS: You flatter me, Caesar.
COMMODUS: Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
NARCISSUS: Caesar?
COMMODUS: That this illness has clouded his mind.
LUCILLA: I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
NARCISSUS: Sneaking around with your brother?
LUCILLA: Without him. He'd be weeping if he overheard that. Well? The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
NARCISSUS: I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
LUCILLA: Why do you keep playing at being so humble? It's a little embarrassing.
NARCISSUS: Why do you play at being drunk?
LUCILLA: How do you know I am playing? Well, the clown is always harmless. Isn't that right? And how did you ever get to know me so well? The last we spent any time together I was fourteen. I think you know me better than my father. He's going to die, isn't he?
NARCISSUS: I don't believe that. He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron. You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
LUCILLA: Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it? The Emperor himself, didn't you know? Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front? Burning patriotism? Filial love? He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor. Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
