FRANK: They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
COATES: I can't hold up my head anymore.
COATES: So, Frank, am I going to live?
FRANK: You're going to live.
COATES: I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
FRANK: I was tired. I needed a coffee.
COATES: What about Kanita?
FRANK: Dead.
COATES: That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
FRANK: No.
COATES: Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
