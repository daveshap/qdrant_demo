Did a burn a bridge with a recruiter?
A few days ago I was contacted by a recruiter via LinkedIn. Since then I had two phone interviews, one with her an one with her agency's rep for the client. Both went really well. During the initial interview, I asked about pay range, and I was basically currently at the top of what they were offering and I let her know this. She said she will submit people expecting our of range as long as it is within reason.

Yesterday afternoon, she sent me a text that after the second interview, they passed my resume on to the client, who was interested in bringing me in for a face to face interview.

The problem is the job was a much longer commute time for me. While the commute wasn't an issue and I told them that, gas and tolls were, and the difference would have effectively wiped out any raise I would have gotten, basically netting me the same amount for an additional hour and a half of commute every day.

I laid out the math to her in an e-mail, and said that I did not want to waste anyone's time if her client was unwilling to go as high as I would need to leave my current position (basically 15% over the top of range she gave me).

I have not gotten any response back since then. Just wondering if I burned a bridge there, or if this is normal. Should I have handled it a different way? I suppose ideally I would have factored this in earlier, but they kind of moved quickly on scheduling the two phone interviews
