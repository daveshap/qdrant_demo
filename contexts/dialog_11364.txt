MORGAN: What's up guys?
CHUCKIE: Why don't you beat off at your house?
MORGAN: I don't have a VCR at my house.
WILL: I just wanted to call before you left. I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.
SKYLAR: I never cared about that.
WILL: Yeah.
SKYLAR: I love you, Will. No take-backs.
WILL: Take care.
SKYLAR: Goodbye.
