Everyone seems to be afraid that the coronavirus lockdown will never end, but I’m afraid of the fact that it will.
I don’t want to go back to my job. I don’t want to go back to school. I don’t want to watch the world pass me by again. It feels like lockdown has slowed the world down to my pace, things aren’t so fast and intense anymore, I feel like I have time to keep up with things and enjoy things. Is it having it’s downsides? Yeah, but I can’t say that the negatives are outweighing the positives. I go back to work next week and I’m dreading it so much. I’m so anxious around people and they can observe it, so naturally a lot of people are apprehensive about speaking to me, or that’s how it seems, and I find it so difficult to actually attempt to fit in. It feels like once the lockdown is over people will go back to their social lives and will be able to enjoy themselves, but I won’t, because I haven’t got a social life. All I’m going to get out of lockdown finishing is the gift of going back to my torturous work.
