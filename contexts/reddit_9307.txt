When do you finally decide to go to the doctor?
I used part of my rent money (have to pay late now) to go to the doctor, because I thought I really needed to and that getting out of pain would be worth the sacrifice. I have had 8-10 canker sores in my throat and all over my mouth nonstop for the past few months. I don't ever have normal, non-painful days anymore. 

Well, I finally gave in and went to the doctor. Even the low income clinic here is a $60 visit. She gave me no answers. She told me it's stress related. Well, yes, I'm poor and stressed and that isn't something I can control or fix right now. No solutions, but I still have to pay 60. 

This isn't the first time I felt like going to the doctor was fruitless. I'm to the point where I don't think I will ever go back to the doctor unless I am throwing up blood. It's all so useless.

So, my fellow poor friends, what's your red line? When do you decide it's time to see a doctor? I'm feeling like a fool right now for going.
