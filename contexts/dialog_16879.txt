MALCOLM: That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
BETTY: What?
MALCOLM: Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
BETTY: How do you like it?
MALCOLM: Delicious.
MALCOLM: Let's talk about you for a change.
BETTY: There's nothing to talk about.
MALCOLM: Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
BETTY: Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
MALCOLM: You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
BETTY: I can handle it.
MALCOLM: They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
BETTY: You have enough worries of your own.
MALCOLM: No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
BETTY: Why do you ask?
MALCOLM: Just an idle question.
BETTY: If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
BETTY: But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
MALCOLM: How old are you, Betty?
BETTY: There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
MALCOLM: Are you?
BETTY: And dogged when I set my mind to something.
MALCOLM: What have you set your mind to?
BETTY: Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
