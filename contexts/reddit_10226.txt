Does anyone else ever think to themselves “any day now I’m going to kill myself”
I just feel like I’m constantly on some sort of pin and needle. Just no way in hell I can survive anymore. Each day is the same boredom and misery. Prison. Let me out. I just don’t see where it’s worth it. I’m not super talented so the creative ability necessary to better myself isn’t there. Self destructive plagues always end up fucking me up
