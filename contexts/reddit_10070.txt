Assistantship/Practica Options
I will be a first-year graduate student this fall and I am trying to be as prepared as possible to know exactly what expereinces I would like to have. I will be back at my alma mater, JMU in their College Student Personnel Program that requires (an) assistantship(s) for two years [1 assistantship for 2 years or 2 assistantships for two years... I will be going for the second option]. It also requires two practica. The practica can be done with both during the school year or one during the school year and one during the summer (typically after the first year, which I will most likely do).

As I am thinking about my goals and what I want long term,

Career-wise, I am thinking primarily about going into: 
-**Pre-College, TriO, Higher Education Opportunity, and Summer Bridge Programs** (1st Choice)
-**First-Year Experience** (Focusing on programming for First-Year Students after Orientation)
-**Academic Advising** and/or **Career Services & Development** but preferrably Academic Advising

I already have my first Assistantship set in Leadership though the Dux Leadership Center. My options for my second assistantship are briefly:

1st Choice- Centennial Scholars Program- basically a program designed for underrepresented student who receive financial support, as well as mentorship, and service opportunities throughout their four years. This one struck me as the go to since I want to work in an area like this after grad school.

2nd Choice- Career & Academic Planning- Due to my interest in Academic Advising and Career Services, this would be a great assistantship to go into especially since I would like to start out as an academic counselor or advisor in Pre-college/Higher Ed/Summer bridge/TriO programs

3rd Choice - Academic Student Services- I think this is important because some students will have tough spots in their life and this office helps with the recovery of students who have have faced some type of academic disciplinary action. It's especially good to understand when working with students looking to succeed in college.

For practicum during the summer I am looking at getting trying to do an internship with a TRiO Upward Bound program or one of similar nature with NODA or ACUHO-I. For the practicum during the academic I am looking here are my options:

1st Choice- Practicum with **Blue Ridge Community College**- Basically I would get expereince working at a community college in a variety of functional areas including: counseling, academic advising, career services, admissions, learning communities, student activities, learning support, and disability services. This would also allow me to get a different expereince outside of JMU since I know JMU really well.

2nd Choice- **Bridgewater College- Career Services**- Another option to consider that is off campus at a nearby institution since , again, getting away from JMU would be good and would also fit into the areas I am looking at long term.

-------------------The rest on this list are all on campus practica--------------------

3rd Choice- Diversity Office

4th Choice- Financial Aid

5th Choice- Diversity Office

6th Choice- Center for Assessment and Research Studies- Student Affairs Assessment Support Services
