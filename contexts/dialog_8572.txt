CHEWIE: Barks his concern.
HAN: No, I'm alright. I'm alright.
HAN: I was worried about you.
LEIA: I'm worried about all of us. I can't figure out what they're up to.
HAN: Me either. They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
HAN: Get out of here, Lando!
LANDO: Shut up a minute and listen. I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
HAN: This ought to be good.
LANDO: Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
LEIA: What about Han?
LANDO: I didn't know you had a price on your head. Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
HAN: You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
LANDO: He doesn't want you at all. He's after someone named Skywalker.
HAN: Luke? I don't get it.
LANDO: Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
LEIA: ... we're the bait.
HAN: All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
LANDO: Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
