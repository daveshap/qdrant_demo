Student Affairs jobs in Europe?
Hello!

I'm looking into possibly working abroad in student affairs once I graduate from my master's program. Has anyone successfully applied for and been hired to work in student affairs overseas (specifically in Europe)? Have any tips to share or processes you followed or resources you used?

Thanks!
