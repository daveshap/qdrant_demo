Attempted suicide two years ago. Just got Facebook timeline and saw something...
I attempted to kill myself in my college dorm a little over two years ago.

It wasn't much of a suicide attempt as it was a, "Hey, I'm gonna do this, and if it happens to kill me, whatever." I was unconscious for over 24 hours. My roommate was the only person who knew at the time. I just told him I got really wasted and was just super tired and sick all day. I had taken three half-full bottles of pills. It was a spur of the moment decision and I had convinced myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong and just wanted to make myself be happy and pass out. Two days later I could barely move, my head was pounding, my heart was pounding, and it was hard to breathe. I may very well have taken a lethal dosage and lived for no good goddamn reason.

I don't remember much of that semester, or really that whole year. So I was surprised to find some Facebook posts just today.

Looking back, I posted every day. Something. Oftentimes a little cry for help, even if it sounded silly. And then, there was a three-day period where I posted nothing. I knew immediately what those three days were. But there was one post on my wall... it was from my sister...

" Brudder! Are you alive? :) "

Holy shit.

I read that today and it just ripped me apart to think that when I was about to die, my sister was thinking about me. I chose to wear a blindfold of self-pity and tried to convince myself no one cared. Don't be a fucking idiot like I was. If I had killed myself, I would have killed my sister, and plenty of other people, too.

If you want to be selfish, be selfish enough to get help.

I hope someone reads this and gets something out of it. My sister and the rest of my family still have no idea this ever happened.

**tl;dr - Sister jokingly asked if I was still alive after I almost killed myself.**
