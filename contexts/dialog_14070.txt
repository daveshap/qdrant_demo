GENERAL: This girl --
ST. AUBYN: This girl -- Thea â€”- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
GENERAL: I will go with you.
OLIVER: I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
CATHY: M~ father will take care of it. Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe. I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
THEA: You are fortunate in your father.
CATHY: Thea is an orphan.
