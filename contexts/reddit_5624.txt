Dishwasher with a bachelors degree
I just got declined to be a dishwasher after sending in my application/resume to a grocery store. Before that I’ve sent in approximately 250 application in a span of 3 months and the only response I’ve gotten have been email declines.

I have a research analyst background at an investment firm and I’ve graduated at the top of my class in Justice Studies from a big university. I’m applying for analytical positions within various companies and it’s just been a struggle. 

How can I pin point my problem?
