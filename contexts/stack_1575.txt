Sizing AC fuse for a DC device I have an enclosure which consists of a power entry module and a 24V DC power supply. So inside the enclosure, the 24V DC power supply is powered by the 230V AC through the power entry module. And this 24V DC power supply will be used to supply/source 3A current to a 8 Ohm load which is a heater.The power entry module for the AC mains side needs fuses to be installed across both line and the neutral.As far as I know I need to install slow blow type AC fuses.But how should I estimate the current rating for the AC power entry module's fuses?
