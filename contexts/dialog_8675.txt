NAOMI: Yours?
JOEL: You take it. I don't know.
JOEL: Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
NAOMI: Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
JOEL: I told her today I need to end it.
CLEMENTINE: Is that what you want?
JOEL: I did it. I guess that means something.
NAOMI: So what's going on, Joel?
JOEL: I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
NAOMI: What?
JOEL: Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
NAOMI: Don't say we" when you mean "you.""
JOEL: I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
NAOMI: Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
JOEL: No. I just need some space, maybe.
NAOMI: The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
JOEL: It's not somebody else.
