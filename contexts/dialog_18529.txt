BROWN: So?
ARCHIE: So, there are rules. Things you do and things you don't do.
BROWN: I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
ARCHIE: You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
BROWN: I speak as I find, Archie.
ARCHIE: Not down south you don't.
ARCHIE: So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
BROWN: I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
BROWN: How much?
ARCHIE: Seventy a year.
BROWN: Not bad, not bad.
ARCHIE: How about yourself?
BROWN: Sixty.
ARCHIE: That's pretty good for a ghillie.
BROWN: Prince Leopold? Is he the one who bleeds all day? So what does his valet do? Wash his poultices for him?
ARCHIE: It's better than shovelling horse shit.
BROWN: If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
ARCHIE: She's hardly a full hamper herself.
BROWN: It's only grief makes her like she is.
ARCHIE: Three years, John. Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
BROWN: She loved him.
ARCHIE: Come on, man. There's love and there's ...
BROWN: What?
ARCHIE: You know what I mean.
BROWN: I'm not sure I do, Archie.
ARCHIE: There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
BROWN: Which one of us is she flirting with?
ARCHIE: The good-looking one.
BROWN: Aye? Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
ARCHIE: You work the system right, you could ask her yourself. Just be thankful you're not working for Household. The Queen never lets them out of her sight. But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
