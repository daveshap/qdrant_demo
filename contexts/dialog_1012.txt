EVE: Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
MARGO: Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
EVE: I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
MARGO: Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too Seventeenish" for me..."
EVE: Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?

EVE: I've got it.

EVE: Right here.

EVE: That's my job. See you at tea time...
MARGO: Eve... ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?

MARGO: Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
EVE: Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
MARGO: Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
EVE: Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me. As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
