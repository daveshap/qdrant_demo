JEFFREY: Buffy, what are you doing here?
BUFFY: I thought we were meeting here.
JEFFREY: I'm here with Jenny.
BUFFY: I don't understand.
JEFFREY: Oh, come on, Buffy. You know what's going on. It's not working out at all. I've got to move on. I mean, I've got needs, too. I told you about all this.
BUFFY: No, you didn't. When?
JEFFREY: Didn't you get my message?
BUFFY: You broke up with my machine?
JEFFREY: You weren't home. Like always.
BUFFY: You left me a message?
JEFFREY: I'm out of here. Jenny.
PIKE: I crashed your party.
BUFFY: Pretty shallow of you.
PIKE: That's me.
BUFFY: I'm glad you came.
PIKE: Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
PIKE: Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
BUFFY: I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
