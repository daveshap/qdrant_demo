Struggling To Find Work During Pandemic
I’m 22 years old and just recently beat cancer after almost a year battling it. I’m trying to get back into the workforce but sadly only have retail experience and now seems like a terrible time for job hunting. I’ve been advised to try to stay home as my immune system is still rebuilding and I’m prone to getting sick but I want to work and get money to save up to move out eventually and pursue career.

I’ve tried applying for unemployment but the same lucky I had with SSI while being treated :(

I’ve looked around my area (NJ) for remote work but haven’t had any luck. I’m honestly willing to do any type of remote work so long as it pays a decent wage. Any advice?
