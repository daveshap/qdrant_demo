Buffering with rectangular end caps and not dissolving I am using QGIS to attempt to achieve what should be a simple task.I need to buffer a polygon layer with flat end caps, and without dissolving the resulting layer. In QGIS there are 3 tools for buffering:v.buffer GRASS commandFixed Distance buffer in Vector > GeoprocessingGDAL Buffer vectors toolv.buffer allows controlling the end cap style and whether the resulting layer is dissolved or not.Fixed distance buffer in Vector > Geoprocessing outputs an undissolved buffer layer, however the edges are round and overlap. It doesn't seem possible to control the end cap type for the edges.GDAL buffer vectors tool presents a similar problematic to Fixed distance buffer in Vector>Geoprocessing tools.How do I achieve a discontinuous (undissolved) buffer with flat edges in the QGIS environment?
