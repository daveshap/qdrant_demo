MIKE: What's the big deal? A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
KATHRYN: That's just it, Michael. We don't!
MIKE: What do you mean, we don't?
KATHRYN: This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
MIKE: Thirty feet???
PHILIP: Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
MIKE: That's impossible. If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh? Tell me that. It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
KATHRYN: That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
MIKE: I don't understand.
KATHRYN: Sharks have to keep moving. They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
PHILIP: Is there such a place? A cave or something with such a flow?
