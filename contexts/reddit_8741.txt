I was reading the article above and found it interesting how presidents can set their schedules as they see fit and it shows that some presidents had longer work days than others which would imply more work but as this isn't a regular 9 to 5, was wondering what the laws say about the duties they MUST complete if any at all.

Article 2 of the constitution ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article\_Two\_of\_the\_United\_States\_Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution)) states the presidents duties but leaves some wiggle room by not setting specific times for some things. For example it says the president must give a state of the union "periodically". What group or person decides whether the president has fulfilled them and what are the consequences for failing to do so?
