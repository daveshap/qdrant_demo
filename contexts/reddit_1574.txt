A Dream Come True
I applied to 6 ivies besides Cornell and Dartmouth.
I’m a runner and literally I ran twice yesterday because I couldn’t stop being nervous for the decisions. I got accepted into Brown and will be the first in my family to go to college. It literally felt like I ran a marathon cause I was so out of breathe when I got in. On top of such great news, my parents were so proud of me. Yet, what finally caused me to crack and cry was the financial aid. They basically gave me a full ride and I couldn’t stop hugging my family knowing I don’t have to worry that they’ll be paying for college. Life was always tough going bill to bill, waking up at 4:30am to go to work on weekends, being so independent because my parents couldn’t help due to the language barrier. I never expected to get this far, in fact if you asked me 5 years ago I wouldn’t have expected to be going to a college in the first place. I have one more decision and I can get straight up rejected cause I’m on top of the world right now.


EDIT: Thank you everyone for your congrats and positive comments it means a lot. Congrats to everyone on A2C as well wherever the journey may take you.

EDIT: Got into my last school which was Stanford. I’m literally in shock.
