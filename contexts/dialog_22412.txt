GARDNER: You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
CLAY: Maybe he did.
GARDNER: We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
CLAY: I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
GARDNER: And that's more important than finding Lednov?
CLAY: Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
