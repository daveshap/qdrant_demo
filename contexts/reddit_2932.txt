Boss asked me pour/serve him water - is this appropriate in a professional workplace?
So I'm kind of at a loss for words. I serve as a Chief of Staff for my boss, but at times he treats me like an entry level assistant \(or even intern\). I've been asked to get coffee, which I feel a bit overqualified for but have learned to bite my tongue, but I've also been asked to do more and more waitressing type duties like clean up his office once he leaves \(he leaves his trash/old cups of coffee etc and I've been told that I'm supposed to wash them.\) One time, he left his old coffee cup in the conference room and a senior associate took the dirty cup and left it on my desk \- with the assumption that it was my duty to go clean it. I have over 10 years of experience and my job is far from entry level. I have really downplayed how much this has bothered me but this past week I was called into his office and he asked me to pour him water and bring it over to him. He was only a few feet away.  I felt that it was very demeaning. I mean, we are in 2018 \- I'm not a secretary from the 60's. Am I wrong thinking this is inappropriate? If so, how should I handle all of the above?
