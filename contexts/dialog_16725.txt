RICKY: Maybe we should call for a cab.
BOBBY: No. Look. There.
BOBBY: 'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
RICKY: You sure?
BOBBY: Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
BOBBY: Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
JIMMY: Hi. I'm Jimmy.
BOBBY: Bobby.
RICKY: Ricky.
JIMMY: Soho Grand, right?
BOBBY: What's that?
JIMMY: You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
BOBBY: I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
JIMMY: Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
BOBBY: Nah.
JIMMY: Traveling light. I like that.
RICKY: Is it nice?
