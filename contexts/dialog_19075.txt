NAPOLEON: God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
JUNOT: There's probably some explanation.
NAPOLEON: Yes, I'm sure he's been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife.
NAPOLEON: Well, anyway, sorry to call you away from the festivities, but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles? I asked for it yesterday.
JUNOT: I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
NAPOLEON: Why did you give it to him?
JUNOT: I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
NAPOLEON: Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
JUNOT: I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
NAPOLEON: I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
JUNOT: He's downstairs -- somewhere.
NAPOLEON: All right, thank you. Please ask him to come here.
JUNOT: Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
NAPOLEON: Certainly.
JUNOT: I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
NAPOLEON: Why not?
JUNOT: Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
NAPOLEON: What are you talking about?
JUNOT: Nothing. That's all I can say.
NAPOLEON: That's all you can say? What are you talking about?
JUNOT: That's all I can say.
NAPOLEON: Now, just a minute. You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
JUNOT: Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
NAPOLEON: Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
JUNOT: There are some things... better left unsaid.
NAPOLEON: You mean about my wife?! You mean there are some things better left unsaid about Josephine?!
NAPOLEON: What the hell is the matter with you?
JUNOT: I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you. I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
NAPOLEON: Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now. Do you understand?!
JUNOT: You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
NAPOLEON: Yes.
JUNOT: I wrote it.
NAPOLEON: What?
JUNOT: Yes, I wrote it.
NAPOLEON: You wrote it.
JUNOT: I couldn't face telling you.
NAPOLEON: You couldn't face telling me what?
JUNOT: About Hippolyte Charles.
NAPOLEON: What was there to tell?
JUNOT: My God, what do you think?
NAPOLEON: Do you know what you're saying?
JUNOT: God help me -- yes.
NAPOLEON: How do you know?
JUNOT: I know.
NAPOLEON: How do you know?
JUNOT: I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon. It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
NAPOLEON: Yes?
