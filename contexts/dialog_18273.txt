LORETTA: Who painted that?
RONNY: Marc Chagall. A Russian.
LORETTA: Kinda gaudy.
RONNY: He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead. Come on, let's go in.
RONNY: Thank you!
LORETTA: For what?
RONNY: I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
LORETTA: So. Where are we sitting?
RONNY: Come on.
