Is there anyone who didn't pass their probation?
I had a 6 month probation period but in the mid term review they cancelled my probation due to me complaining about a lack of support to the HR. It was an extremely toxic environment and every blame was being put on me since I was a newcomer. Initially I used to bow down to everyone who said it's me who is to be blamed but it was taking a toll on me. One day my manager shouted at me in front of everyone for no reason and I had to go to the HR, after which I was terminated in two weeks. 

The reason they gave me was that I shouldn't have gone to the HR even though I had repeatedly flagged out to my manager regarding a lack of training & support. Now they're claiming money from me that they provided for relocation & a joining bonus. I'm really feeling lost right now being unemployed and I want to know if there's anyone here who has failed the probationary period as well and what you did afterwards to recover. 

Hoping for suggestions. Thanks :)
