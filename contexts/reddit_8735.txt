What happened to household income in minority American families in the late 90s?
A friend and I were looking at some data recently about household income, wealth distribution and poverty between ethnic groups in the United States over time.

The data seems to indicate something happened in the ~~mid-to-late 90s~~ early 2000s that caused a sharp dip in median household income among minority families, and an increase of minority families below the poverty line, but we were curious as to why that was the case.

[This Census visualization from '76 to '12](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-median-income-in-the-us-by-race-2013-9) shows a sudden drop in median household income among minorities around 2000. While white families experienced a very slight dip as well, all minority groups took a sudden and relatively deeper dive just ~~before~~ after the year 2000, and continued to drop through the next couple decades.

[Figure 2 on this page](http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq3.htm#Figure 2) shows that the decline of blacks and Hispanics in poverty suddenly stopped and poverty of those groups began increasing again around the same time. Figure 3 on the same page shows the poverty rates among children in those groups, which is even more prominent.

Despite the amount of data, there's not a lot to go on for why the sudden shift. Typically when you see spikes/dives in large datasets like these, there's one or a small handful of factors that can be identified as causual.

What happened in the ~~late 90s~~ early 00s that would have contributed to this?

Edit: folks have pointed out the graph indicates a change in the early 2000s, not the late 90s. Should have put my glasses on!
