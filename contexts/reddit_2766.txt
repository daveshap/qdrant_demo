I've been stuck in retail for the past three years, how can I get myself out?
I'm in my mid-20s and feel lost career-wise. I graduated a few years back with a liberal arts BA, and found myself totally unemployable as a result. After over a year of looking, I ended up a cashier at an upscale grocery store just to start paying down my loans. I worked my way to a lead cashier position, with the promise of a promotion to assistant manager that has yet to materialize.

I have all the responsibilities of a manager, but I make $13.50/hr and have a completely variable schedule. I'm starting to feel this lifestyle taking its toll on me, and really just want a M-F/9-5 office gig that pays $40-50k a year. I've been looking at job sites, but I feel overwhelmed at all the job titles I've never heard of and all the requirements/experience I don't have. Any advice on a direction I could take would be massively appreciated.
