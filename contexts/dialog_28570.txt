ALEXANDER: This is magnificent...
MARA: Thank you.
ALEXANDER: And this is your work"?"
MARA: Yes.
MARA: The mud carriers.
ALEXANDER: I can see Kalen's point.
MARA: Want to be a high climber now, do you?
ALEXANDER: What you need is an engineer. If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
MARA: It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
ALEXANDER: What's it all for?
MARA: I don't understand.
ALEXANDER: I mean, why do you do it? What purpose does it serve?
MARA: It has no purpose. It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
ALEXANDER: Most things. We're very high on purpose.
MARA: It's always been this way here. We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
ALEXANDER: Or mud carriers.
MARA: And there's no shame to that. It's all the same here. Everyone has an important job to do. We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
ALEXANDER: What are you?
MARA: I'm a planner. I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
ALEXANDER: How do you decide?
MARA: I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done. I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
