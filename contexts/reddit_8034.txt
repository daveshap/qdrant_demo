Applied for a competitive graduate assistant position... did not get it
I applied for a competitive position. It would have fully funded me, and I felt passionate about the job and fully capable of doing it. I even nailed all of the interviews. They did not offer it to me, though, and now I feel discouraged and worn out.

I’m going to keep trying to get a position at the school to help with my funding. For now, I’m sad and tired.
