FRANK: What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
WILLIE: Out.
FRANK: When they coming in?
WILLIE: Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
FRANK: What d'ya got?,
JACK: Bosen black. Flat.
FRANK: What d'you say, Willie? Tighten her up?
WILLIE: What's the gig?
FRANK: Two nights.
FRANK: What d'ya got?
JACK: Yamaha white. Nice.
FRANK: What do you think?
JACK: Try the black Knable.
FRANK: Tag 'em, Willie. The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday. Thanks.
WILLIE: My pleasure.
FRANK: You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
JACK: Trust me, you're not missing anything.
FRANK: You look awful.
JACK: Thanks.
FRANK: Really. You sleeping?
JACK: Only on odd days.
FRANK: Seeing anyone in particular?
JACK: Why the interest?
FRANK: Because I'm your brother. Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
JACK: I'm not seeing anyone. In particular.
FRANK: What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
JACK: Uh-uh. How about you? You seeing anyone?
FRANK: Funny. Strike a bell?
JACK: It's only a ring. Not a collar.
FRANK: It's more than that.
FRANK: By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
JACK: No thanks.
FRANK: No, I mean it.
JACK: So do I.
FRANK: We gotta go, Jack.
JACK: No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
FRANK: This time you gotta go.
JACK: I don't gotta go.
FRANK: You gotta go.
JACK: Says who?
FRANK: Your older brother.
JACK: You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
FRANK: Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
