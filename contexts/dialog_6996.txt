LLOYD: You heard about Carlton Fraser?
FRIDA: Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
PETER: You had a date with Carlton?
FRIDA: It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
LLOYD: Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
FRIDA: What makes you think I was the last one?
PETER: He means the last that we know of.
LLOYD: This one walk you home too?
FRIDA: No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
LLOYD: You got a dog?
FRIDA: No, I have a cat.
LLOYD: How big?
