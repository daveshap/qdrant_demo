How much does Saudi Arabia contribute to U.S. oil prices?
Trump has just [thanked Saudi Arabia for low oil prices](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-jamal-khashoggi-murder-latest-saudi-arabia-oil-prices-lowered-twitter-a8644671.html) although the U.S. is ~~about to be~~ the [largest exporter of oil](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37053).

How does the relationship actually play into domestic costs of oil?
