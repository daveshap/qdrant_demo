Laborer to Corporate Level
Doing an Interim job... from Laborer to Corporate. 

I just want to know is it normal in a Corporate job to constantly stay busy? No lunches, trying to find new ideas everyday.  3 conference calls at once, etc. 

I just understand how anyone can be productive with all this crap going on at once.

I understand being busy, but constantly scattered and try to prove myself that I'm good at what I do or always being questioned how I would like to grow and develop every week... is getting old.

Maybe I'm just overwhelmed.  My old job was a cake walk... go into work get my assignments and go to town. Still sucked though... toxic environment.. long hours.. no sleep. I left to go to a more professional career and increase pay... I might have messed up or I just haven't found what I enjoy.

Idk... still lost in my 40's lol..
