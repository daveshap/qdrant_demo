Finding a job during the coronoavirus outbreak?
 

I'm curious as to what career opportunities that are available during the coronavirus pandemic that allow one to work from home? I'm afraid my opportunities are limited to only having a highschool diploma/cosmetology license, however I know there are people with more extensive qualifications, so all options are accepted under this post!

Thank you for any recommendations!
