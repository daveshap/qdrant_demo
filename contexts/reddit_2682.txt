Received offer from 2nd choice employer, have an interview with 1st choice tomorrow. How do I approach this?

I got a job offer today, and they need an answer by Monday. I have a 2nd interview tomorrow with a job I like more. Except this interview, they said wasn’t really an interview, but they want me to speak with other managers so they can “get to know me” and that it was informal. Sounds like they are trying to see if I’m a personality fit.

Should I let them know at the end of our conversation tomorrow that I have another offer? Or should I email the hiring manager and let her know before the interview?
