Binary predictor with highly skewed distribution I am running a linear regression model and I have a binary predictor that has a highly skewed distribution. For example, one category represents 96% of the data. In terms of frequency, the other 4% represents 26 observations. Should I keep/remove this binary predictor variable? And, what is the rationale for doing so? Thank you in advance!
