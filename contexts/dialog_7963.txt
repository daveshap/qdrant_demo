SHARI: Really?
ED: Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
SHARI: Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
ED: Really?
SHARI: Oh God, this is so weird.
ED: Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
