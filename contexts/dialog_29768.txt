CLARENCE: Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
ALABAMA: The oriental.
CLARENCE: The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
ALABAMA: Want some Goobers?
CLARENCE: Thanks a lot.
ALABAMA: I thought Sonny was the good guy.
CLARENCE: He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
ALABAMA: Great movie. Action-packed!
CLARENCE: Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
ALABAMA: Sonny kicks ass.
