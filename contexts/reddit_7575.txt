Did you ever realize you just aren’t cut out for grad school?
I’ve started my program, which is an intensive 1 year molecular bio program, and I’m feeling like I can’t keep up with everyone else. Is there a point where you have to realize it isn’t imposter syndrome and it’s just that you weren’t supposed to be here? Like your dreams are higher than your capabilities will ever be?
