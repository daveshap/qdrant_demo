TREVOR: Hint. It's not a geographical location.
ALLISON: I'm stumped.
TREVOR: It's inside a moving car.
ALLISON: Bull...
TREVOR: I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
ALLISON: Okay so... what's the safest place?
TREVOR: Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
ALLISON: Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
TREVOR: Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
ALLISON: Second most common?
TREVOR: Skin cancer.
ALLISON: Eighty third most common.
TREVOR: Pitbull attacks.
ALLISON: You just made that up.
