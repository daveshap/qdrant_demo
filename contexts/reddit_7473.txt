I want to get a PhD in epidemiology, but I'm not sure if it will be enough.
I want to do my PhD in epidemiology after my MPH in epidemiology, but I'm coming from a background in biochemistry so when I look at epidemiological research I feel like I'm missing the wet lab/molecular biology/chemistry component.

I love, love, love doing research. I enjoyed it as an undergraduate student so I know that a PhD is what I want. But I want to be in the field of public health which isn't really a hardcore science field. So I'm trying to find a bridge.

I love epidemiology, don't get me wrong, but how can I bring my undergrad in biochemistry and my MPH in epidemiology together in my PhD?

P.S. I haven't started my MPH yet. I got the information about epidemiology research from looking up what it means in journals, reading research papers, and looking at the websites of potential PhD schools for the list of expected competencies.
