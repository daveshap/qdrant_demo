LOUIS: Where is Michelle?
D'ARTAGNAN: There.
D'ARTAGNAN: There were two. Not one. But two.
ANNE: I couldn't tell you. You had enough to carry.
D'ARTAGNAN: Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more. But that one, it was enough. Enough to make me love you forever. I want you to remember that... and go on. As strong as you are now. No matter what happens.
