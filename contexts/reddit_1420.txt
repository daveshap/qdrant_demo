Walked out of a job interview
I just wanted to take a moment to say fuck anxiety. Walked out of an interview for a pretty good job yesterday. They threw a softball technical question at me and I just cracked. It was like I couldn't think at all. I choked at looked at their stares of disappointment. I just said "ya know what? I'm done" and asked to be escorted out of the building. Not a fun time. Luckily I'm already employed but I never want something like this to happen ever again. Anxiety is a bitch.
