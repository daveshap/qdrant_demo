UCSC Graduate Students are on WILDCAT Grading Strike!!!
Hi all (mods, I hope you understand how this is a relevant posting on this subreddit),

I’m leaving this here because it’s something that affects all grad students to some extent. Currently, UCSC graduate students are enduring precarious conditions as we are living in one of the roughest housing economies in the nation- the majority of us are forced to pay 50% or more of our TA incomes towards rent alone (likely more if living in campus graduate student housing). We are currently on an unsanctioned WILDCAT GRADING STRIKE in order obtain a necessary Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). We need this COLA in order to get out from underneath the rent burden so many of us are facing. 

We need support and solidarity  from anywhere and everywhere we can get it! Please visit https://payusmoreucsc.com  or @payusmoreucsc on Instagram for more information on our COLA campaign!!
