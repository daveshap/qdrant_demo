I’m done with this sub. It’s affecting the way I view myself and it’s really pissing me off.
This sub and r/chanceme are really starting to piss me off. Everything is so ridiculous and people are literally obsessed with getting into a school to the point where it’s unhealthy, and it seems like half of the people on here are only here to flex. 

Don’t get me wrong, these subs are great for information and advice. I’ve asked quite a few questions on here and usually gotten helpful responses.

But ever since I’ve started browsing r/chanceme and this sub, I’ve compared myself to people so much more, and even though I’m well above average in academics, I genuinely feel dumb because I get B’s in AP classes and im only applying to state schools and I’m not applying anywhere with a tiny acceptance rate. That could be a mental health issue with myself, but I’m sure that other people feel the same. 

Maybe I’m just jealous or in a bad mood. I don’t know. All I know is I spend way too much time on this sub and I need a break so I can actually get my homework and scholarship essays done. 

That being said, I sincerely hope you guys get in where you want to go. If you’re procrastinating, PLEASE get off of this sub and do your work.
