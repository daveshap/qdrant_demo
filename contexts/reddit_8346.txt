What kind of legal action (if any) can foreign governments take on the US if their media personnel are assaulted?
There have been quite a few countries that have dispatched reporters to follow the protests that are breaking out around the US.  [Several of those reporters have been assaulted](https://time.com/5846497/journalists-police-george-floyd-protests/) during these protests turned violent.

Do members of the foreign press have any protections from these instances, and if so, what kind of consequences can occur if those protections are violated?
