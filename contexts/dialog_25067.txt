HOFFY: Come on!
BLONDIE: Static!
DUKE: Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
SEFTON: Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
SCHULTZ: Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
STOSH: Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
SCHULTZ: Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
HARRY: Wisecrackers? Where did he pick up his English? In a pretzel factory?
SCHULTZ: You always think I am a square. I have been to America. I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
HARRY: You should live so long.
SCHULTZ: This is me in Cincinnati.
STOSH: Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
SCHULTZ: That is my wife.
STOSH: Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
SCHULTZ: Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
HARRY: Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
SCHULTZ: Droppen Sie dead! Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
SCHULTZ: All right, gentlemen! We will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged.
STOSH: Why don't we just plug up that tunnel -- with the Kommandant on one end and you on the other.
SCHULTZ: It is not me. It is the orders. I am your friend. I am your best friend here.
DUKE: Cut out the guff, Schulz. We're on to you. You know everything that's happening in this barrack. Who's tipping you off?
SCHULTZ: Tipping me off? I do not understand.
HOFFY: You're wasting your time, Duke. Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
PRICE: Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
DUKE: Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
SCHULTZ: Which one of you is what?
PRICE: Which one of us is the informer?
SCHULTZ: You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
DUKE: That's the general idea. Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
SCHULTZ: You are talking crazy!
SEFTON: No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
SCHULTZ: You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
HARRY: Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
SCHULTZ: Raus! Raus! All of you!
