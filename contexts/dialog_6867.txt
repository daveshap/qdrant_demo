SEBASTIAN: I'm sorry that was out of line.
CECILE: I want to go home.
SEBASTIAN: I was just kidding.
CECILE: I want to go home.
SEBASTIAN: Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
CECILE: My mom? Don't call my mom.
SEBASTIAN: Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
CECILE: Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
SEBASTIAN: Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
CECILE: And then I can go home?
SEBASTIAN: Of course. I'm not a monster.
CECILE: Just a kiss, right?
SEBASTIAN: I swear.
CECILE: What are you doing?
SEBASTIAN: You promised to let me kiss you.
CECILE: But -
SEBASTIAN: I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
