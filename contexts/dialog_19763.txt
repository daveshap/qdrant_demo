HELMS: I suppose, Mister President
NIXON: You're correct. I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not. The FBI is worthless in this area. I want your full concentration on this matter ...
HELMS: Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
NIXON: Then find something. And I want these leaks stopped. Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
HELMS: I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
NIXON: Screw congressional oversight. I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know. Pay close attention to this.
HELMS: Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
NIXON: Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers. Things I signed as Vice President. I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
HELMS: You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
NIXON: Yes ...
