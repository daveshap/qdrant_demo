Hello everyone! 

Thank you all for the continued support to make this sub the strong community it is. Our sub relies on active, committed, and passionate moderators, and to that end we're putting out an open request for new mod applications to make sure we can keep the discussion at the level you expect.

Here's what the job entails:

First, you need to have time. /r/NeutralPolitics is a heavily moderated subreddit that requires mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend an hour or more reading posts and messaging people. For our regulars, that's probably close to their participation pattern anyway, but applicants should understand that there's a time commitment involved.

Second, you need to be familiar with [our guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. Mods read all submissions, and we make an effort to read all comments as well. The vast majority of submissions to /r/NeutralPolitics get removed by a mod for not conforming to the guidelines. In each of those cases, the mod who removes the post will message the OP explaining why the post was removed and/or work with them to craft an acceptable post. Comments that don't conform to the guidelines are also removed, though they're more difficult to pick out than submissions. It's kind of like a garden: left unattended, some of the plants will creep around and get unruly, but if you stay on top of it, it's a really neat place to hang out.

We also make heavy use of browser extensions to assist us with our work, so you will need to be able to moderate from a computer with a recent version of Chrome or Firefox, and be willing to install a few extensions.

Other responsibilities include:

* Take note of problem users and bring them to the attention of other mods.
* If you have a question about a post, submit it to other mods for review.
* Join discussions with other mods about ways to improve the subreddit.
* And of course, participate in the sub as a normal user.

If you're interested in becoming a mod in /r/NeutralPolitics, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) with the following info:

* A brief explanation of why you want to join the team
* Why you would be a good fit
* Your time zone, or what time you would be available to help moderate
* Which forest animal you would be and why

* Do not tell us your political leaning. **Any application that includes such information will automatically be disqualified.**

We look forward to hearing from you.
