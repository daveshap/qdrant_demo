POPPY: You know how I feel about you. You know how much I need you. How much I trust you. I would do anything for you.
ARGON: Why are there two ottomans?
POPPY: Icarus, please! This is important!
POPPY: Look at me, Icarus! Look at my body. I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to. 'We will always love most that which we create.' Is that still true?
ARGON: Yes. Yes, of course it is.
POPPY: Then you still love me?
ARGON: Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
