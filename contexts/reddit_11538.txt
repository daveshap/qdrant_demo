i dont want to fail at life
i graduated from a good college had fun, moved back home and been working shit jobs this past year to figure things out. i have a science degree gpa isnt very good about 3.0 and 2.7 sci gpa. i coasted thru school and unmotivated. i work shitty jobs and see people my age or older working at shitty retail. i see a 50 year old working at retail store getting paid 9 dollars a hour and having to work there to survive. people are stuck there, they cant just drop like i can. im scared to end up like that, how people disrespect u not treating u as an equal. also just being okay of living such a boring existence.i quit that job and now work at a hospital getting paid double, but still same thing not what i want to do with my life. after some reflection i wanna go to dental school, so gonna go do a post bac and get my grades up. i wish i worked harder in school, but now i have a strong drive to work hard in school get good grades. im scared tho that i suck, cant get good grades, that im incapable of it. i cant continue to waste my years living like this. i need to challenge myself, i would absolutely hate myself if i look back working a shit job all because i was lazy, miserable with my life...
