Do women approach men?
21 year old virgin guy here, zero experience with women. I've heard that men and women are the same, that theres very little difference except for sexual anatomy. So my question is, do women approach men like we approach them? Because I've never had a women intiate a conversation with me in my life, so I must be really unattractive. I always thought women just never approached but if we are truly the same then they must, it just never happens to me.
