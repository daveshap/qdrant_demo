Is it just me or does looking at openings for higher paying jobs depress you?
I mean seriously, I only make 31k a year. Every time I look at a job opening for 35k+ a year, they want a ton of experience, a college degree, certifications, or all of the above. It’s really depressing and super discouraging when you’re just trying to get a career of some sort going. It feels like an endless loop where I’m trapped at a dead-end job that already has me capped out in terms of making more. I’m only 22, but I’ve been working here since I was 20. I’m barely scraping by, and it feels like I’m wasting my time, and that I won’t find a better opportunity because of all the requirements needed to get something else going. It really does feel like I’m alone when it comes to this. Does anybody else feel this way?

Edit: Thanks for all the advice & encouraging words y’all. I’ll definitely try to take most/ all the advice & motivation given to me. its very appreciated.
