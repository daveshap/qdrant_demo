Why is nothing fun anymore?
(Please don’t mind the flair, I didn’t know which to add) 

I used to enjoy drawing. I don’t anymore. It all looks like shit. 

I used to read. I don’t anymore. I don’t have the attention span for it anymore. 

I used to watch movies. I don’t anymore. Nothing seems entertaining enough.

I used to love listening to music. I don’t anymore. It has turned depressing. 

Why. Why can’t I enjoy things as much as I used to. Why has it changed. Why did it have to change.
