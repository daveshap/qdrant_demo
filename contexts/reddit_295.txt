I regret something awful that I did
Ok so someone recently posted something on r/teenagers about their sister ruining their minecraft world. They asked for advice and how to forgive her and avoid killing her. I, being the impulsive teen that I am, commented something along the lines of “Don’t forgive her, just kill her.” 
I know realize how bad that sounds, but I thought it was a funny joke and I didn’t think of it as a threat at the time. The user came out with a statement later about how they had gotten so many death threats from people about their sister. 
I feel so bad about what I wrote. I didn’t think it was a big deal at the time, and I commented an apology for saying that but I feel like it wasn’t enough. Is there anything else I can do to make up for it? Or should I just delete my comment and leave it alone?
