MELVIN: Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend... now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, Thank you." No
CAROL: Okay.
CAROL: What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours... afraid it isn't clean?
MELVIN: I see the help -- judgement call.
CAROL: Just give yourself a little pep talk. Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out.""
MELVIN: What's wrong with your son, anyway?
CAROL: What do you care?
CAROL: He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection... Is this bothering you?
MELVIN: No.
CAROL: An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
MELVIN: His name?
CAROL: Spencer.
MELVIN: Okay.
CAROL: Spence.
