My Father read my WhatsApp Chat
So i left my phone with my dad for a few hours and he somehow knew the password.
I come back and he hands me the phone back without saying anything.
I later check my screen time and find that he looked at my WhatsApp for a little more than an hour!!!!
The problem is that there was this awkward chat with my crush where i had told her about my 'made up' girlfriend ðŸ˜¶ and told her all sorts of things related to that 'made up' gf (why i did that is a different story leave that for now plz).
That chat (it was all done by one of my friends cause i didn't wanna make that story and things like that) contained some things like how close we were (it's all fake.... nothing physical ... probably a kiss idk but still ...that i was quite close to her ..u know) and now i know that he read it allðŸ˜­.... I don't know what to do...he didn't say anything and probably thinks that it all was me whereas it's all fake and plus written by my friend....and i feel very weird about it allðŸ˜”.
I never did it yet he will think that it was me!
He won't say anything i know but what will he think of meðŸ˜­.
Should i talk to him about it(will be very hard for me) or what should i do????

P.s.- I don't if it's normal for many but i don't have this type of image Infront of my parents and am pretty stressed about what will he think of me..!!
