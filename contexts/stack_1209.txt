Master slave replication with different mysql version is on both slave and master Currently, we have MySQL master-slave replication. Both master and slave servers have Mysql 5.5 Currently I need to add one more Master server having version 5.7.Is it possible to add Multiple masters to a single slave server?<blockquote>  One master and slave is having Mysql 5.5 and new Mysql server is 5.7</blockquote>Is it possible to configure Master-slave replication with different MySQL version?
