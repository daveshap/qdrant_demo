PINKUS: You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
MAYOR: I'll explain it tomorrow!
PINKUS: Is it hard?
MAYOR: No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
HARTMAN: Just one second --
PINKUS: That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
MAYOR: We'll fix that, too.
HARTMAN: Just -- one -- second!
MAYOR: All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
HARTMAN: What?
MAYOR: Shoot to kill, I said.
HARTMAN: I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
MAYOR: Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
HARTMAN: Hello, Olsen... Listen... Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there. Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
MAYOR: Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
HARTMAN: If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
