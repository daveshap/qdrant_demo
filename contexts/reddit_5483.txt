Phone Interview Monday. How can I make a case of my work experience, even though I was fired from my last job?
Hello Reddit,

I have a question regarding work experience as I’m currently job hunting. 

I’ve been fired from my last job as a assistant fashion designer as of December 2019. I’ve had this job since mid October so roughly 2 months.

I was also also working part time in evenings during this time but only as a seamstress.

As an assistant fashion designer, I did tech packs for the company that included fabric type, trim info, colour way, etc. We then send my tech pack to one of our suppliers in China with a sample. 

The sample and the actual product that I designed in the tech pack comes back and we make revisions. This means I have to update the measurement spec sheet. This goes along with doing a fitting where someone wears the product I’ve made and then we make adjustments and send it back to China where hopefully all the mistakes were corrected. 

So everything I’ve mentioned here is the basis of being an assistant fashion designer or technical designer in the fashion industry.

Since job hunting, a lot of companies are looking for a year experience or more in terms of technical design.

Since I only had a technical job for 2 months, and I’ve been fired, I was wondering where else could I put that experience in my resume?

The only experience that I have that are slightly similarly related to that was my seamstress jobs or my job as a student entrepreneur where I made my own clothing, or my time in college where I learned these things. 

I guess what I’m asking is, what is the best case I can make for myself that I do have some experience as a assistant fashion designer/technical designer without mentioning that my last job that I was fired?
