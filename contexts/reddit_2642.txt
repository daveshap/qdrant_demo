Low stress and flexible jobs?
I just quit my brutal job doing industrial construction working 70+ hours a week in awful conditions. That job really broke me and makes me never wanna work again. I have business aspirations but I need a job to bridge the gap until I get there. I need something that gives me freedom to live my life how I’d like to, whether it’s work from home or independent contractor work or whatever, I don’t care. Money is lower on the priority list. I just wanna do something somewhat productive that doesn’t make me wanna kill myself.
