I just gave the worst presentation
And I feel like I was never meant for science and that I'm just to stubborn to see that. 

While they never said it was bad, I know deep in my heart that it was. I knew at every moment where my confidence waned. 

I know my data is "interesting" (used in the case of fishy data). I didn't do it on purpose, I gathered it with the minimal tools that I had. 

I'm afraid that this only reinforces the idea of sucking at everything I do. 

Thanks for sticking around and reading this post.
