Why should I be worth others time if I don't think I'm worth my own?
I'm gonna give some context for this post.

For the past few years of my life, I've been in and out of therapy and nothing has worked. The medication I'm currently on seems to be doing at least something but it's come at the cost that when I have particularly bad depressive episodes I feel worse than I did prior to taking the medication.

Now onto the main part of the post.

I don't deem myself worthy of the time of those around me. Everybody has better people they could be spending time with. I'm not interesting - I talk about the same shit constantly. I come across as pretentious. I feel like I'm nothing but an irritation and a burden to those around me. I struggle to focus on one given thing meaning people get annoyed by my constant lack of attention span. I complain way too often about my feelings to those around me. I just hate myself so deeply at present. My only solace seems to come from sleep or from writing. Nothing else seems to help.

I'm not even worth my own time anymore.
