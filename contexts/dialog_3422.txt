MALKOVICH: How do we do that?
MANTINI: A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
MALKOVICH: What's the play?
MANTINI: Say... Equus"? It's got everything."
MALKOVICH: Never heard of it.
MANTINI: Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
MALKOVICH: Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
MANTINI: Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
MALKOVICH: I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of Long Day's Journey Into Night.""
MANTINI: Great then.
MALKOVICH: Is there dancing?
MANTINI: No.
MALKOVICH: Who needs dancing?
LESTER: How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
FLEMMER: No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday. It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
LESTER: What kind of circumstances?
FLEMMER: Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
LESTER: The Great Mantini?
FLEMMER: No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
LESTER: Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational."
FLEMMER: But I think I have another plan.
LESTER: Do tell. I love a good plan.
FLEMMER: Why are you being like this?
LESTER: I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
FLEMMER: Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
LESTER: Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
FLEMMER: I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
LESTER: I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
FLEMMER: Fine. Let's drop it.
LESTER: Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
FLEMMER: Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
LESTER: Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
ELIJAH: You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
LOTTE: I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
ELIJAH: It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
