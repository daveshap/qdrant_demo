I said something insensitive and it's killing me inside.
I was elected to host a cast after-party after performing in a play, and did so willingly. Once everybody showed up, we sat in a giant circle and basically began playing silly games; spin the bottle, truth or dare, etc. It was fun! At one point, we were playing Never Have I Ever, where you basically say "never have I ever _____", and everyone who has done such a thing takes a drink. I was fairly inebriated, but not the point where I wasn't thinking properly. In my infinite stupidity, I simply said the first thing that came to my mind.

"Never have I ever contemplated suicide."

I don't know why my mind strayed to such a bad topic at the time, nor do I have reason for why I didn't stop myself, but I'm incredibly glad that we were able to move on immediately from that. 

The rest of the party was fun, everybody had a good time from what I could tell, but I was upset by what I had said. I don't know how I made any of those folks feel, but I'm sure someone was upset with me at least at some point though the night. 

As soon as we had done our goodbyes and hugs and everybody left, I wanted to cry. I sat in my kitchen for an hour upset, knowing that I probably won't see some of those people again for a long time. I didn't get a chance to apologize for saying what I did, and I can't un-say anything. I feel bad about something I can't change anymore, and I don't know what to do about it.

fucking ugh
