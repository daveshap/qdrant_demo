RIPLEY: To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
DICKIE: To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
RIPLEY: I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
DICKIE: That's good.
RIPLEY: I've got plans!
DICKIE: Ripley's plans.
RIPLEY: Esatto. I'm always planning.
DICKIE: Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
RIPLEY: Why are you asking all of a sudden?
DICKIE: No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
RIPLEY: Why?
DICKIE: I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
RIPLEY: Then I'll take it as a compliment.
DICKIE: I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
RIPLEY: Ha.
DICKIE: Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
RIPLEY: I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York...
DICKIE: I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
RIPLEY: What?
DICKIE: So cool.
