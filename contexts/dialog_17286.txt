MORPHEUS: This line is tapped so I must be brief.
NEO: The agents --
MORPHEUS: They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
NEO: What do you know?
MORPHEUS: You're the One, Neo. You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
MORPHEUS: Do you still want to meet?
NEO: ... Yes.
MORPHEUS: Go the the Adams Street bridge.
