PROJECT OFFICIAL: You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
ELLIE: I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
PROJECT OFFICIAL: It's designed purely as a defensive device. Call it a reasonable precaution.
ELLIE: Call it xenophobic paranoia. Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this? This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
PROJECT OFFICIAL: Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion. But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
ELLIE: Y'know what? Fine. I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
