MA STONE: Well -- that's comforting! Supper.
JABEZ: Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
MARY: It feels fine now, Jabez.
JABEZ: Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
MARY: I'd love to.
JABEZ: Hello, Sheriff.
SHERIFF: Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
JABEZ: And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
JABEZ: Stevens!
STEVENS: Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
JABEZ: I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
STEVENS: No, Stone!
JABEZ: -- in gold.
STEVENS: I'd like to know where you'd get it....
JABEZ: You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air. Like that!
STEVENS: Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
JABEZ: Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad....
