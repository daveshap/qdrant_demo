MICHAEL: Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
LETTY: Yeah?
MICHAEL: You've got one hell of a great body.
LETTY: Well, I understand. I know my behavior was poor.
PRINCIPAL GAIL: So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
LETTY: Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
PRINCIPAL GAIL: I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children. Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
LETTY: Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
PRINCIPAL GAIL: I'm glad you're doing well.
LETTY: I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
