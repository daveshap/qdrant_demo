REDBEARD: Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now. You two will sleep beautifully in your tents. And stay there.
SAMUEL: And where will you sleep beautifully?
REDBEARD: Patterson and I will be in the old hospital- where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers- -and by the time we're done, I promise you, the odor of blood will be irresistible.
REDBEARD: Think about something else.
PATTERSON: Have you ever failed?
REDBEARD: Only in life...
PATTERSON: Goddammit!
REDBEARD: It's all right. Stay ready. They know it's there.
REDBEARD: Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea? Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
PATTERSON: But of course yours worked.
REDBEARD: In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
