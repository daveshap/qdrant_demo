LOMBARD: Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
DEBORAH: No!
LOMBARD: What do you mean, ‘No’, Mrs De Moraes?
DEBORAH: My brother hung himself.
LOMBARD: Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
DEBORAH: Leon hung himself.
LOMBARD: Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
DEBORAH: Leon hung himself...
LOMBARD: Leon’s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon’s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I’d exceeded his expectations.
DEBORAH: Leon hung himself...
LOMBARD: Leon didn’t hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
