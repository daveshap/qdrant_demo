SAM: I'm hungry! Where's my dinner? Who ate my dinner? Huh? Who's in trouble now?
ALYSSA: Hi.
SAM: Hey.
ALYSSA: What are you doing here?
SAM: They're trying to make me spend the summer here. I'm leaving in the morning.
ALYSSA: Where to?
SAM: I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
ALYSSA: Your dad's really gonna build his house?
SAM: I don't know.
ALYSSA: Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
ALYSSA: You should stay.
SAM: I don't know.
ALYSSA: Where's your dad?
SAM: He jumped into the ocean.
ALYSSA: Tell him I said hi"."
