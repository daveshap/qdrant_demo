Really struggling to read papers!
I'm currently studying for a master's in philosophy. My programme is research-based, so I'm expected to read a large number of papers. However, I'm really struggling. I started the degree back in October, and I've done a fraction of the reading I should have done by this point in the year. I find it exceptionally difficult to focus for longer than a couple of minutes - after that, my reading comprehension dwindles to next to nothing. I struggle to get through a paper a day. I was an avid reader in the past, but my ability to read even the literature I used to devour has decreased significantly. I also struggle to effectively summarise the papers I read. What can I do to overcome this?
