Is it weird to contact my long lost childhood best friend?
This girl and I were best friends when we were around 7-10 years old for a few years. I met her baby sister (who’s birthday is the day before mine) and watched her grow up. She had a grandpa who showed me magic tricks, and who’s dog guarded us, and me and her went rowing with her dad, camped in her backyard, and threw New Years parties singing on table tops. I kind of forgot how good those times are and want to reconnect with her, even though I’m 15 and she’s 16 now. I don’t expect to become best friends with her again but kinda want to DM her. I feel like she’ll think it’s weird and won’t really remember me. Do you think it would be weird to do so?
