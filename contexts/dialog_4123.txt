FRED: You're like your mother. You love money.
GEORGE: Dad.
FRED: No, it's good. You have a family. It's good if it makes you happy. It's nice to have nice things. Are you happy, son?
GEORGE: Yeah, Dad. I'm happy right now.
DIEGO: Three years. How long have we been in business? Three years. Does she get to meet your connection? Was she good enough?
GEORGE: Shut up, Diego. They're going to be here any minute. I'm trying to concentrate.
DIEGO: I'm very angry with you, George. Very angry. You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife? A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this. You and me.
GEORGE: What do you need my connection for, Diego? What are you going to do with it?
DIEGO: What do I do with it? Nothing. It's for peace of mind. It's for the principle.
GEORGE: Jesus fucking Christ, Diego. I ain't telling you. It's just business. Now, shut up. You're driving me crazy.
DIEGO: I'm driving you crazy? No. You're driving me crazy. We had a dream. What happened to our dream?
