WRIGHT: Rich...
TRAVERS: Good morning, Walt.
WRIGHT: I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
TRAVERS: Richard Travers.
WRIGHT: Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
TRAVERS: We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
WRIGHT: Appreciate it.
TRAVERS: You're the boss. Let's head out to the tarmac. Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
MATHESON: I don't know about totally.
TRAVERS: Who the hell ever is. This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
MATHESON: Do you always transport through the air?
WRIGHT: Mostly. Armored cars can be hijacked. Trains can be derailed. But nobody can get to us in flight.
TRAVERS: I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
WRIGHT: I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
TRAVERS: We should be. Everybody wants what we have.
BRETT: Gabe! Hey, man! Gabe! It's Gabe!
EVAN: How yo doin', Gabe!
