RAMBO: I don't work with spooks. Not after that op in Cambodia.
KIRKHILL: I'm authorized to get you out of here. I thought that's what you wanted.
RAMBO: What's the job?
KIRKHILL: Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out. Two men. Two days.
RAMBO: Why me?
KIRKHILL: We like you. At least the computer at Langley likes you. Pulled your file because of various factors. Service record. Area familiarity.
RAMBO: Where?
KIRKHILL: Not yet.
RAMBO: I'm not jumping blind.
