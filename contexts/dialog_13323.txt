GABRIELLE: Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
NATHAN: Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think. God, Did I hang up on you?
GABRIELLE: Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
NATHAN: No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
GABRIELLE: Is everything fine?
NATHAN: Oui. Now you've got me talking French.
GABRIELLE: I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over. See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
NATHAN: I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
GABRIELLE: Coincidence, yes? And how is our son?
NATHAN: Our...? Oh! He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
GABRIELLE: I should turn them off. Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
NATHAN: When you were a little French girl?
GABRIELLE: Oui.
NATHAN: That would be good.
