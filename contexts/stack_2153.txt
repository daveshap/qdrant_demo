What is the most effective way to grind for drops from the three spirit dragons? Dinraal, Naydra, and Farosh are benign spirits flying around their respective regions in the form of elemental dragons. Attacking them with arrows will make pieces fall to the ground depending on where they are hit. These pieces are used for a few shrines, but also for enhancing some Armours.What is the best strategy to accumulate these pieces?What sort of appearance patterns do each dragon have? Is this purely random, or is there a way to influence their arrival?Is there a more effective trick to get a higher number of drops during a single encounter?The pieces that drop are as follows:Dragon's Scale: Shed by hitting the dragon over most areas of its body.Dragon's Claw: Shed by hitting the dragon's limbs.Dragon's Fang: Shed by hitting the dragon's mouth.Shard of Dragon's Horn: Shed by hitting the dragon's horns.Each dragon has their own set of four pieces.
