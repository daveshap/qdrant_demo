New job, remote learning difficulties
Hi All,
I accepted a new role and have been working for just shy of a month. It’s a completely new industry and there’s so much to learn. Every role I’ve taken has been a new industry, and I’ve been able to dig in and learn.

I’m finding it really difficult since we aren’t in the office and my group is really siloed/full of individual contributors. Everyone is nice and will help if I ask, but lack of face time and exposure is really hurting the learning process. I’m honestly terrified of not excelling and getting let go.

My manager and director are really nice but are in the middle of a huge project so they don’t have a lot of time to meet with me. I’m reading manuals, taking notes, using Google to dig in more but I’m just not feeling confident I’m being set up for success. I’ve always learned hands on - being included in meetings, on emails, etc. but I’m not being looped in even when I’ve asked.

I’m in contact with my previous employer since I left on excellent terms with them but they’re on a hiring freeze until there’s more certainty around COVID and how it’s impacting the business.

My question is - what the heck should I do? I’m going to keep scheduling 1:1s with my boss, but reading 80+ page manuals and ppt overviews without business context is really not cutting it. I’m at the point I don’t even know what questions to ask because I just can’t get the exposure I need to dive in.
