Disappearing Apps I just installed Ubuntu 18.04 on my new comp. I was looking through the apps, tried one out and when I went back into the apps menu, over 50% of my apps were gone. I have looked through everything and can not bring them back. If I go into Ubuntu Software, it shows them as installed, but I have to look them up by name and I am not familiar with all the app names yet.
