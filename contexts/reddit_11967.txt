UPDATE!!!
I'm not going to bother linking the first few posts because lazy. 

I started me new (temp) job today! They called me about the position yesterday and I was like HELL YEA I'LL DO IT. It's only 3-4 weeks long assignment, but it'll be a huge help in getting my affairs in order for when I move out. Which is...in 2 weeks from now. (Thanks to a certain Redditor for the offer!) Also I've already made 2 sales on eBay; my PSP and my DS Lite. So that's another $XX dollars in my pocket for gas or granola bars or whatever else I need. 

Thanks again y'all for being all supportive and stuff. Now that we have these fancy new flairs I want you to abuse the hell out of mine so I can spread around some of the love I've been feeling here lately. :D
