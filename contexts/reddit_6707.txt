Contacting Recruiters on LinkedIn
There is a company I am really interested in doing an internship at, but I want to get in touch with a recruiter as well as applying online in the hopes of increasing my chances of hearing a response back.

I was wondering if anyone had advice on how to message recruiters out of the blue on LinkedIn to show that I have a real interest in working at their company and would be a great fit.
