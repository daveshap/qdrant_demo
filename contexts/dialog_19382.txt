KARLA: Hello, remember me?
CRAIG: Hell yeah, I remember you.
KARLA: I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning. They're assholes.
CRAIG: It's cool. You ain't got to apologize for your brothers. They're big boys.
KARLA: I just wanted to give you this.
CRAIG: Most definitely.
KARLA: Better sooner than later.
