TERMINATOR: Torque wrench please.
JOHN: Here. I wish I coulda met my real dad.
TERMINATOR: You will.
JOHN: Yeah. I guess so. My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984. But right now he hasn't even been born yet. Man, is messes with your head. Where's that other bolt? Thanks. Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess. I see her crying sometimes. She denies it totally, of course. Like she says she got something in her eye.
TERMINATOR: Why do you cry?
JOHN: You mean people? I don't know. We just cry. You know. When it hurts.
TERMINATOR: Pain causes it?
JOHN: Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. You get it?
TERMINATOR: No.
JOHN: Alriight!! My man!
TERMINATOR: No problemo.
