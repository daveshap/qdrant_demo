Kinda hate living w/ my mom
So hear me out I have reasoning. Basically my mom is over religious to the point it’s almost like a cult. So I’m an agnostic/atheist now but I still haven’t told my mom, because if I did she’d go ballistic. But that’s not my main problem. She rejects common logic to the to the point where it’s really annoying. So to give an example from earlier today, my sister made a joke about anti-vaxxers. My moms not a hardcore anti-vaxxer but she responded with something along the lines of, “You don’t need vaccines as long as you have faith in god.” My sister told her actual evidence and my mom neglected it. I know this really isn’t that bad but there’s more. She will physically abuse us and say we deserved it for minor things and tell us that “we’re not pleasing god.” She tells my siblings and I how much of a disappointment we are because we’re slightly overweight. She has kicked me out of the house multiple times even though I’m a minor. After doing all of this she’ll lecture us on how we’re wrong and we need to apologize. (Sorry for bad grammar I’m on mobile)
