HILDY: Ring that number, will you?
BURNS: Come here. See if we can move it.
HILDY: Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
BURNS: Will you come here?
HILDY: Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
BURNS: When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
HILDY: Yes.
BURNS: Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
HILDY: I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother. Oh-h... I'm going out and find her!
BURNS: Don't open that!
HILDY: Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
MURPHY: There she is!
MCCUE: Say, Hildy...
HARTMAN: Just a minute, Johnson!
HILDY: Let go o' me. What's the idea?
MCCUE: What's your hurry?
MURPHY: We want to see you.
HILDY: Take your paws off me!
HARTMAN: Hold her, boys!
BURNS: Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
HARTMAN: You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
HILDY: Let me go! Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
HARTMAN: Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
MCCUE: We know what you're up to.
ENDICOTT: Probably goin' out to get Williams.
SCHWARTZ: The door was locked.
WILSON: She and Mollie were talking.
HILDY: I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
HARTMAN: Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
HILDY: You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
HARTMAN: I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
HILDY: Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
