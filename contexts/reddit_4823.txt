If more people talked about mental illness less people would die.
 My depression was triggered by the death of my father and ever since I    have been on a roller-coaster of emotions.

I use my blog to   share the experience and to help others by letting them know they're  not   alone [https://notokayisalsookay.wordpress.com](https://notokayisalsookay.wordpress.com/)
