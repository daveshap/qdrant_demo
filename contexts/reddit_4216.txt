I don't like to compete
Maybe its my family history of having neglectful parents. But I feel really disinclined to compete for someones affection in dating. That's why I have largely tapped out of the scene. If I know a guy is seeing multiple girls, I lose interest almost immediately. I don't want to be the most beautiful, the most interesting girl out of the bunch like literally ever. Lately I have even lost desire to dress up, put on makeup etc. Guys I date seem to even want to encourage a sense of competition in me, but I just cannot feel it. 

Strangely, in other aspects of life, I can be very competitive. But when it comes to dating, knowing that I'm the best out of a bunch for someone doesn't give me pleasure. The effect is in fact kind of opposite. I don't want to be liked because I'm wonderful. If someone chooses me, I don't feel like I won a prize. Why was there a competition in the first place? If this person has to deliberate, he wasn't meant for me. 

Of course, men like to date multiple women. I think this might be why I don't feel like investing or putting in efforts anymore. Getting a man just isn't very rewarding to me.
