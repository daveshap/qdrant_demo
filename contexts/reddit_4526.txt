"Why cant I enjoy fun things I used to love?" (HERE'S WHY)
So I feel like this is an issue that is mentioned a lot. The reason why, is not going to be encouraging, but at least an explanation. I asked my therepist this and this is what he said (he is really good at stepping into his patients shoes); 

"Picture this. You are depressed. You feel almost nothing and you cant control it. Things that made you happy, you can not feel anymore. But you know what it felt like, you have felt it before; and you shame yourself for not feeling it anymore. So you know it exists and remember the feeling. So you go to a carnival with a friend. The lights dont sparkle like they used to. You dont want to do anything but your friend persists. You begin to cry. Your friend asks whats wrong. You say 'im trying to enjoy this, but I cant feel the joy no matter how hard I try. Being here is torture, because I am looking at what I love and cant feel it. Its making me miserable and sad that I cant feel the joy and the love. Please take me home' ". 

Its okay if you cant feel certain emotions right now. But it is not forever, and YOU WILL FEEL AGAIN. Everyone has their journey. But its ok to express whats going on with you. Its ok to have this emotion roller coaster. You are ok. And this is not forever.
