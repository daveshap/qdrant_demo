MAC: Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
GIN: I've got something for you.
GIN: Aren't we early?
MAC: Little celebration before we set off.
GIN: To us. To the Mask.
MAC: To our...partnership.
MAC: You're nervous again.
GIN: When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
MAC: You were afraid of heights?
GIN: Terrified. Still am.
MAC: How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
GIN: I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
MAC: Aren't we all.
GIN: My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
GIN: He wasn't.
MAC: So you had to be your own lifeline.
GIN: Something like that.
