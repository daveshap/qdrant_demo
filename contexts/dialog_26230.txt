DIANE: NO! Wait...um... We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
KANSAS: We were told you could fix us up.""
HANK: Really...
LUCY: Yeah. Itchy" sent us."
HANK: She did, did she? How is the old girl?
LUCY: Definitely old.
HANK: That's Itchy, alright. How many y'need?
DIANE: Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five. Five should do it.
HANK: Okay. How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
DIANE: Ammo?
HANK: Bullets.
DIANE: Bullets? No bullets! Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full. You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.
HANK: Right. That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
CLEO: What?!
KANSAS: You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
DIANE: Hey, hey, hey. C'mon you guys. Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow. Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
HANK: Oh, why didn't you say. For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you. The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash. Take it or leave it.
