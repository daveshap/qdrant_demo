JAMES: Charles! I didn't know you were back. Have a good holiday?
CHARLES: Not too bad, thanks. How have you been?
JAMES: Working hard on that book I was telling you about. Coming to the meeting?
CHARLES: I'm not sure I can face it.
JAMES: Keep me company.
JAMES: How's Mary?
CHARLES: She's fine. Well, actually we've broken up. It's all over.
JAMES: No. That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
CHARLES: Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions. I can't talk about it.
