applying for a job in Amazon ,my qualification is perfectly matching , but never got phone call
i'm writing this to ask for guidance in subject that really I don’t understand and i hope you can spare a few minutes to help me.  

I applied for one of amazon jobs that perfectly matches my qualifications,  And unfortunately i just checked my dashboard and found that I’m no longer under consideration, now may i ask : 

**does Amazon has unwritten requirements in certain hobs that not publicly announced?**  

 I’m matching all the job post requirements, academic background,more years of experience, large project management experience, two certification of the preferred required four certifications , working in similar environment to Amazon, etc 

 I’m deeply disappointed because i know I’d be a great fit to the job and I didn’t even got a phone call,   I know that Amazon is an equal opportunity company that doesn’t discriminate based on gender, ethnicity, beliefs,etc. 

so **why?! What am I missing ?**
