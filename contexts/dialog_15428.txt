KATHY: This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead. You can't undo it.
DAVID: You don't understand.
KATHY: Yes, I do. I found your file. I know what happened.
DAVID: They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother... There was so much blood... It covered everything.
KATHY: I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
DAVID: Don't you see? I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing. I sat with them all. I held their hands. I stroked their hair. I was with them to the end. I took away the blood. I washed them. Their crossing was peaceful.
KATHY: I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down. Put it down, David.
