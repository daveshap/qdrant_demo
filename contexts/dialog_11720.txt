LIZ: I understand, but Annie, please...
ANNIE: - See, what you can do for him --...
LIZ: Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
ANNIE: ... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
LIZ: It isn't right to make him suffer...
ANNIE: And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem! I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay? Please.
