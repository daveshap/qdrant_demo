Problem with stair switching for light (3 way) I just did an electrical survey of my house receptacles and fixtures.  All voltages are around 119.5V except one.  On the light that is controlled by 2 switches (ie on 2 different levels of the house) the voltages are 42V when the light is off, and 119V when on.  The other 3 way lights (ie same set up on 2 other levels in the house) are 0V when off and 119V when on.Any idea what is the issue?Thanks in advance.
