This subreddit normalizes academic excellence and amazing accomplishments made by teenagers
Let's take a minute to think about how far we've come. Whether you ended up first or last place in that National Science Olympiad you went to last year, just remember that the fact you made it to that level of competition is groundbreaking.

I'm confident we are all going to end up in great professional careers. The college admissions game is a crapshoot, but we are all hardworkers. And that won't change whether we go to community college or top twenty schools.

Congratulations for making it this far. 
And upcoming sophomore, junior, and senior classes, let's give it our best to show what we are capable of this next academic school year.
