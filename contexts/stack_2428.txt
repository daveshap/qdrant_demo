How to generate a raster showing min/max values from a stack of rasters? QGIS and Python I have a stack of rasters (NDVI values over a year) and I want to generate a single raster showing the maximum difference between the layers. So the result should be a single raster showing the difference between maximum value and minimum value for each point across the landscape. How can I do this in QGIS or Python?
