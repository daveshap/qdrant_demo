Graphical method for obtaining waveshape of current I was doing exercises of the book Electrical Engineering Fundamentals by Vincent Del Toro. Then I saw this question.The voltage waveform shown in fig is applied separately to a pure capacitor of 1 F and to a pure inductor of pure of 1 H. Carefully sketch the current waveshape for each circuit element over the specified time interval. Hint : A graphical approach may be found easier than an analytical one.The problem I have is that I am able to solve it only by the analytical approach, then I plot the graph. I can't think how a direct graphical approach can be applied. I will be grateful for your help.
