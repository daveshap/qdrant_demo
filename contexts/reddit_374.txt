Third Wheel vs. Bad Friend
My two best friends are in a relationship. Sometimes they like to spend time we'd usually spend together just with each other. Which is fine, I'm happy for them and I understand wanting some time alone with your s/o, but then it came to my attention that they're going to have the next period alone together anyway. 

It kindof hurt that I have to spend lunch alone while they get to socialize with each other,  but I don't ever want to make them feel bad for being together.

How do I tell them about how I feel without making them feel like shit?
