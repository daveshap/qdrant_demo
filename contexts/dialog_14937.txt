GRANT: Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
BILLY: No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
GRANT: That does sound lucky.
BILLY: It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
GRANT: Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
BILLY: Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
GRANT: The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away. And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
