JOE: Hi, Jerry. Everything under control?
JERRY: Have I got things to tell you!
JOE: What happened?
JERRY: I'm engaged.
JOE: Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?
JERRY: I am.
JOE: WHAT?
JERRY: Osgood proposed to me. We're planning a June wedding.
JOE: What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
JERRY: You think he's too old for me?
JOE: Jerry! You can't be serious!
JERRY: Why not? He keeps marrying girls all the time!
JOE: But you're not a girl. You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
JERRY: Security.
JOE: Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
JERRY: Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid. I know there's a problem.
JOE: I'll say there is!
JERRY: His mother - we need her approval. But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
JOE: Jerry - there's another problem.
JERRY: Like what?
JOE: Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
JERRY: We've been discussing that. He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
JOE: You're out of your mind! How can you get away with this?
JERRY: Oh, I don't expect it to last. I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
JOE: Like when?
JERRY: Like right after the ceremony.
JOE: Oh.
JERRY: Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
JOE: Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
JERRY: But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
JOE: Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
JERRY: I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy - What am I going to do about my engagement present?
JOE: What engagement present?
