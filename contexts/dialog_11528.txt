TOM: How you get all this money?
PA: Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
TOM: Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
AL: She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
PA: Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'?
TOM: How about it, Ma?
MA: I'm ready.
