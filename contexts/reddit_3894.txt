How is it so easy for everyone else.
Why is dating absolutely impossible for me but a breeze for everyone else? I have a friend who was just single for about two weeks and has already found a new boyfriend, meanwhile I've been split with my ex for 10 months and I can't even get one date in that time period? Not for a lack of trying either, I've been on all these dating apps, I get matches, I get likes, but nobody *ever* asks to go out with me or even hook up. It fucks with my confidence big time.

Also, it seems like when you're 21, everybody is taken. Literally 80% of my college must be in a full out committed relationship, I feel so alone in being single and I fucking hate it. I hate when people say to focus on yourself and love yourself, that only delays the inevitable, this is a culture that teaches us that it's bad if you're single. People look at you funny when you tell them you're single. Dating feels like a race that I ended up last in, an auction that I showed up broke to.


Edit: I'm a dude!! The friend I mentioned is a female
