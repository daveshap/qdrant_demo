I’ve never had more than a thousand dollars in my account before. This morning I woke up with two thousand and I cried.
My stimulus check, unemployment check, and CARES act check all direct deposited overnight and I woke up with over $2000 in the bank. I used a lot of it already to pay off some medical debt, but I also pre-paid my rent and put another rent payment in my savings in case of an emergency. I’ve never had this much money in my life and I just cried from relief. Maybe I’ve just been quarantined too long but at least one good thing is coming out of it.
