Adding an Apple TV to the Home app in tvOS 11.4 tvOS updated yesterday to 11.4 on my Apple TVs, and on startup asked what room each Apple TVs is in. However, it didn't show the list of rooms I have defined in my Home app. It showed a generic list of room names. I selected one, expecting that I could access it and change its name in the Home app, but now the Apple TV is in limbo somewhere and not accessible to the Home app. And there doesn't appear to be any user interface in tvOS to bring that room selection back up.How can I regain control of my Apple TVs in the Home app?Addendum: here's a pattern (perhaps) that I hadn't noticed before: My Apple TV 4s did show the correct room list and allowed proper linking. The Apple TV 4Ks did not, and those are the subject of this post. They do show as Home Hubs in the iOS Home app, show up as Airplay destinations, and have all other indications that they should work.Addendum #2: I factory reset one of the misbehaving Apple TV 4Ks and it allowed proper room selection. It also has a room selection menu in the Airplay settings. The misbehaving Apple TV 4K does not have that menu choice in Airplay to get to any Room settings, so I'll probably factory reset it too. I suspect a bug at this point, but it's not clear why it triggered for some Apple TVs but not others.Addendum #3: Factory reset of the remaining unit corrected the problem. Why this happened to multiple 4K units and not to any Apple TV 4s is a mystery.
