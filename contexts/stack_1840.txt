What single word could be used in place of \"long drawn out procedure\"? I'm thinking of something like ceremony or ritual - but without the implication of significance. More like a large collection of tasks in an everyday context like a meeting or a series of medical procedures, say prior to surgery.I'm thinking of a word that's not necessarily formal, or that the tasks have to be rigidly adhered to in a specific order. It could just be a large number of a tasks say, a shopkeeper may have to do prior to opening a store say. An example sentence may be say, the chairperson of a meeting saying:<blockquote>  Please people, we need to keep moving if we want to complete the      __________ of this meeting </blockquote>The closest things I can think of arelong drawn out procedure - (but a single word with the same meaning as this phrase)
