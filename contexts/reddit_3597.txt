Swipe on your opposite-gendered friend's account
Me (23F) and my best friend (23M) were chilling and swiping on tinder and decided to swap phones and see what happened. 

And we both learned a lot. 

He swiped right on a lot of guys that I normally swipe left on...and in the following days I learned that a bunch of them were actually super cool, leading me to resolve to be less picky in the future. Also learned that there were some guys that I should just keep trusting my gut and swipe left on. (after about the third creepy message that I got in a short period, my friend says "damn why do guys feel like they can talk to you that way? That sucks") 

I also learned that you can run out of likes, which I didn't know before haha. 

I would judge my friend and I pretty similar in terms of looks and datability. However I found that a LOT more women were "swipable" than I have experienced with men. Asking the question "would this woman be cute and interesting enough to date my best friend?" meant that a lot of women made the cut, which was interesting to me. 

Last thing I learned was how genuinely shitty it feels to use up all your likes and only get one match. He told me that it was something of a miracle that I even got that single match for him. 

I feel like a lot of guys complain about this (especially on this sub) and girls roll their eyes like "boo hoo, just have some confidence." Or the classic, be attractive, don't be unnattractive. But he's a good looking guy, tall, with a solid job and cool hobbies. He doesn't spend a lot of time with OLD because he's usually dating someone. I thought he'd be getting at least a portion of the matches I was. But no. And damn it felt bad (even though I did know that they weren't not-swiping on me). 

Anyways those were my observations and I found it really interesting, and thought you guys might as well. Next time I need a reality check, I'll definitely be asking him to switch phones again haha.
