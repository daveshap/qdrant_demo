PUFF: As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
GABRIELLE: Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union. I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
PUFF: Let's go eat, I'm starved.
GABRIELLE: French?
PUFF: Oui.
