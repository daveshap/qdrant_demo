FOLEY: Now when I say understand" I want the whole group to say
GROUP: Yes, sir!
FOLEY: Louder!
GROUP: Yes, sir!!
FOLEY: I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
FOLEY: Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
GROUP: Yes, sir!
FOLEY: I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
GROUP: Yes, sir!
FOLEY: Hi, son.
SID: How're you doing, Sarge?
FOLEY: What did you call me?
SID: Pardon?
FOLEY: What did you call me, boy?
SID: I called you Sarge.
FOLEY: Before that.
SID: I didn't call you anything before that.
FOLEY: You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
SID: No.
FOLEY: No, sir!
SID: No, sir.
FOLEY: Lauder, Sweet Pea!
SID: No, sir!
FOLEY: Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
SID: No, sir.
FOLEY: Where are you from, boy?
SID: Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
FOLEY: Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
SID: No, sir.
FOLEY: Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!
FOLEY: Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
ZACK: No, sir!
