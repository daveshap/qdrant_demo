MEREDITH: What's your secret?
RIPLEY: Excuse me?
MEREDITH: No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
MEREDITH: I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
RIPLEY: Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
MEREDITH: Hello.
MEREDITH: You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
RIPLEY: Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
MEREDITH: So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
RIPLEY: My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
MEREDITH: Which is?
RIPLEY: Emily. Just kidding.
MEREDITH: The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
RIPLEY: As in the...?
MEREDITH: As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
RIPLEY: Randall.
MEREDITH: Right.
