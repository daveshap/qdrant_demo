JOE: These guys're good drivers.
RATSO: They gotta be.
JOE: Yeah.
RATSO: You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
JOE: How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?
RATSO: I read it.
JOE: Shee-it. You believe all you read?
JOE: If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
RATSO: I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
JOE: Keep the goddam blanket on.
RATSO: I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
JOE: Sounds like they knew you.
RATSO: Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
JOE: Hey -- whatsa matter?
RATSO: I'm wet.
JOE: You're what?
RATSO: I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
JOE: Hell, don't cry about it!
RATSO: Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
RATSO: I'm falling apart, that's funny?
JOE: You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
