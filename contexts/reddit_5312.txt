Have I already burned a bridge a supervisor?
I just started working at Walmart as a stocker, and I think I did decent for no previous experience in stocking, but of course I made a couple of minor mistakes, One, I couldn't fit a whole box of yogurt or whatever on the shelf and my Co-worker that was helping me throughout my shift didn't say anything to me about me putting a half empty box back on the cart and my supervisor called me out on it (not so bad). then later on my supervisor gave me another co-worker to work with. and he talks quiet plus he talks while walking off. so we went to the cold storage to start stacking eggs to stock, so I was pulling the cart of eggs towards the door waiting on him then supervisor yells "don't stand around." "you're supposed to follow him and help" "This is the easiest way to piss me off, by standing around not doing nothing." Then about 15 minutes later we started stocking the eggs and the supervisor walked up and told me to take my lunch break early but the way he said was, to me like he was relieving my more experienced co-worker of me helping/learning how to stock eggs. So I thought the standing around situation was a little uncalled for so I came back from break early to talk to HR about the situation because I thought that was a little harsh for someone on their first day. I didn't do these mistakes by choice.

TL:DR first day of work, went to HR because I felt like supervisor was being too harsh.

Edit: why are all y'all down voting everything I"m saying, just because you disagree

**Edit 2. I didn't go to HR, I went to the person who did my orientation training (personnel) but yes I still overeacted**
