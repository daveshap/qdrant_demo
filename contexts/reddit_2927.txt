I'm 22 and I'm stuck. What can I do?
Currently working at a grocery store

I've thought of becoming a nurse, HVAC tech, audio engineer, aircraft mechanic, forester, industrial engineer, accountant, chef, the list goes on and on.

I've not completed schooling, I've just worked dead end jobs for the past 3 years. I was in special education in highschool for ADHD and I've tried a stimulant when I was 19 and it didn't work out. Things happened, then I'm basically back to square one living with my parents.

I've completed my remedials, and then English 101 and a couple of electives (one elective earned in highschool). I have a gpa of 3.8.

I have no idea what I want to do. I'm thinking of moving out of my parents and move in with my brother who will charge me $550 in rent along with about a $160 car bill a month. Up there I can go to school and study business. 

Down here it's cheaper because I'm living with my parents, but I just hate it down here. I'm thinking of going to college here because it's just cheaper, but what's the point if I'm going to be here for like another 4 years? I'd like to move out and back home.

I may sound selfish with this post and I apologise for that. I guess you could say I'm just looking for general support, not just career guidance. I am lost at the moment and maybe I just want to be happy and content. But my mind just races and I'm worried I'll make the wrong choice.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.


Edit: I went to sleep and woke up. Tons of inspiring comments. Thank you all
