Fuck girlfriends I just want a friend
People always talk on here about being lonely and wanting a girlfriend but I honestly couldn't care less, I just want a friend. A single one. When you think about it, love is kind of selfish... the idea of wanting one person all to yourself *forever* is kind of psychotic. With friends however you can maintain a healthy distance but still enjoy each others company and also genuinely care about them. 

Anyone else feel the same way?
