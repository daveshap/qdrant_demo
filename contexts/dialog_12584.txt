HIDER: I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
JULIE: Uh huh.
HIDER: Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
JULIE: Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
HIDER: It is tomorrow.
JULIE: Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
HIDER: I think we should talk first.
JULIE: About what?
HIDER: About us.
JULIE: Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
