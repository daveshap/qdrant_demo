Android connect bridge for Ubuntu I have a Marshmallow based Android smart phone. Most PC suites won't work on Ubuntu. Is there any integration possible between Ubuntu and Android. I heard about KDE Connect which connects Android to Ubuntu. I am not sure whether it will work since I am using stock Ubuntu + Unity, not KDE Plasma.Is there any trusted tool ( I have privacy concerns ) which can link an Android Smart Phone with Ubuntu ? Thanks.PS : I prefer using a WiFi network for the integration
