ELDERLY MAN: I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
SELENA: What do you want?
ELDERLY MAN: Western Europe.
SELENA: I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
ELDERLY MAN: No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
SELENA: Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
NIGEL: It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
SELENA: I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
NIGEL: You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
SELENA: I just did. Because I have the Power.
NIGEL: You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
SELENA: Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
NIGEL: Cigarette?
