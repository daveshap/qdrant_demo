NICKY: Yeah, I'm over here with him.
EDDY: Oh.
JERRY: Oh.
EDDY: We're waiting on Carmine.
JERRY: Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.
NICKY: Carmine? He was here before. I saw him. He had a suitcase and everything, and then he left.
EDDY: Carmine left?
NICKY: Uh-huh.
JERRY: Carmine left?
EDDY: He's gone?
JERRY: He's not here?
EDDY: Carmine's gone.
NICKY: I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
EDDY: Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh?
NICKY: Oh, thanks, Eddy.
