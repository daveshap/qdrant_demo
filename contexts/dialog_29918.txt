JOHN: I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
BLIND MAN: That's 'cause he's dead.
JOHN: Oh, Jesus.
BLIND MAN: I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
JOHN: What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
BLIND MAN: He's only just dead. What was I supposed to do with him? I can't take him away anywhere. And nobody wants to take him for me. Do you?
JOHN: He no!
BLIND MAN: See. Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me. That's where he belongs anyways. Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes. He was just a pup then . . .
JOHN: Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
GRACE: I'm just going to my car.
JOHN: That's right on my way.
GRACE: My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
JOHN: My name is John. Now I'm not a stranger anymore. See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
GRACE: Do you have to call me that?
JOHN: I don't know your real name.
GRACE: Maybe I don't want you to.
JOHN: Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
GRACE: You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
JOHN: My cup runneth over, beauti--
GRACE: It's Grace.
JOHN: May I carry your package, Grace?
JOHN: Jesus.
GRACE: You sure you can manage?
JOHN: I got it.
GRACE: Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
