How do I know the difference between wanting to quit my job and just needing a vacation?
I'm going to make this short...as the world is going mad right now, decent jobs are hard to come by and I fortunately have a decent job. The pay is good as are most aspects of it, however, I have been falling behind on my productivity and each day is more dreadful than the last and the days are just dull.

I really don't hate my job but I don't love it either...what do you guys recommend?
