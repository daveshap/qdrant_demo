Using transactional replication to roll back from SQL server 2014 to 2008R2 I know it sounds crazy. However its just a thought given by DBA,s and management to check on.We are going to use LS to do migration of around 10 TB Db from 2008R2 to SQl 2014. This DB is 24*7 in used and an OLTP in nature. In case we need a revert due to XYZ issues, we are thinking to use tran replication from 2014 to 2008R2 , the old server so as to make sure we don't loose any activity since migration. Also on 2014 db will be configured for mirroring .I am not sure how much above is helpful. Please provide your thoughts if this can be achieved or for any better way of doing this.
