Did I rush myself?
So, I've dated this girl for like 4 months, you may say it's soon to say this, but I love her. The thing is, she said she felt the same, but never showed as much as me and sometimes I felt like I was the only one trying to make our relationship work. We had great moments together and sometimes I could see in her eyes she loved me.

We were going through a strange week, we didn't have much to talk about and at the end of that week she told me she was confused about us, that wasn't the first time she said that. I asked if it was a phase and what she wanted to do, she answered "I don't know" to both questions. I said I didn't want to be with someone that wasn't sure she wanted to be with me, she just apologize and we say goodbye. 

She tried to reach me two days later saying how much she missed me and how much she loves me, I was heartbroken and told her how much she hurt me, with all her confusion and everything else she did, like blowing me off and how she didn't seem to like me as much as I liked her. She apologized once again and said she wouldn't "bother me anymore". My last messages were:
-you don't bother me
-I wish we could solved this
-but I don't know how.

We haven't talked for a few days now. I miss her a lot, but she hurt me so much. Did I rush myself breaking up? Am I being too proud?
I can't stop thinking about her.
