COLUMBUS: In one act of brutality, you have created chaos. Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us! All that because of your criminal savagery!
MOXICA: Savagery is what monkeys understand.
COLUMBUS: You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions. Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
MOXICA: You will regret this.
