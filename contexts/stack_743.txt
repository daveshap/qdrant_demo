Unable to capture screen with VLC on Ubuntu+KDE 17.10 I am trying to play screen in a VLC window. (To share-screen on chrome) When I try to capture screen with \"Desktop\" option it says:<blockquote>  Your input can't be opened: VLC is unable to open the MRL 'screen://'.  Check the log for details.</blockquote>In the popup window. I have tried enabling verbose logs, but nothing gets generated in the logs either. I am using KDE. If it helps, the same used to work when I was running mint+cinnamon on this same machine.
