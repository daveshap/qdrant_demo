WAITER: Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
LONGFELLOW: Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
WAITER: Uh-huh.
LONGFELLOW: I'm a writer myself, you know.
WAITER: Uh-huh.
LONGFELLOW: I write poetry.
WAITER: Uh-huh.
BABE: You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you? All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?

LONGFELLOW: Oh, the poet? Where?
WAITER: Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
LONGFELLOW: Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
BABE: Really?
