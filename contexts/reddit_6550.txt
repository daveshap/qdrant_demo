Glassdoor listing has blatantly fake reviews and refuses to remove them.
The company "Red Label Enterprises" (https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Red-Label-Enterprises-EI_IE1958975.11,32.htm) seems to be plagued with an abundance of great reviews, especially in the last two months. Here are some examples of language that has just been slightly reworded:

* Keep the focus on growing the team just as you have been. Investing your time into us is extremely appreciated.
* Keep investing your valuable time with us.
* Thank you for the mentorship!
* Thank you from the bottom of my heart for ALL that you've done and continue to do.
* Keep coaching and thank you for the mentorship.
* Thank you for being so inspiring.
* Keep mentoring people and coaching the way you do. Thanks for always being there for us no matter what time of day
* Keep up the great work and THANK YOU for EVERYTHING you do for us!!
* Keep up the great work!!
* Keep doing what you're doing. Don't change a thing!!
* Don't ever lose your fire!
* Please keep on doing EXACTLY what you're doing!!
* Please don't change a darn thing!!

There are so many more examples. This "marketing" company seems to be preying on college students. Even worse, a LARGE percentage of low reviews over 1.5 years state that the company has been shorting employee pay, only paying a fraction of what is owed.

I contacted Glassdoor but they just reiterated that they were **unable** to do anything. 

The only logical conclusion that I can take from this experience is that Glassdoor is a useless service and is *probably* paid to keep such blatantly fabricated reviews online.

I encourage you to go through the reviews and judge for yourself. I wanted to prevent others from wasting their time, but as long as Glassdoor is enjoying it's profit, they really don't care.

Are there any other sites that are more reputable?
