ADAM: Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
MICHEAL: They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
BOYD: Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
MICHEAL: You said nobody would miss her.
BOYD: No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
ADAM: Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
BOYD: What does that mean?
ADAM: You got us into this mess.
BOYD: Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
ADAM: Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
BOYD: Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
ADAM: Don't talk to me about character.
