How is distance between galaxies and rate of expansion of universe calculated? I have recently read in book 'Theory Of Everything' that rate of expansion of the universe is changing 5%-10% per 1000 million years, I would like to know how such calculation has been made. Edit: I want to know the principle and theory of finding the distance between galaxies and rate of expansion of the universe and not just formulae.
