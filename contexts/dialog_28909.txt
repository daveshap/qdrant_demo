JACK: It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
ROSE: How cold?
JACK: Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
JACK: Ever been to Wisconsin?
ROSE: No.
JACK: Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
ROSE: I know what ice fishing is!
JACK: Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
ROSE: You're crazy.
JACK: That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
