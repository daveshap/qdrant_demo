FERGUS: What's that?
JODY: Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
FERGUS: No?
JODY: Nope. Not handsome at all.
FERGUS: You trying to hurt my feelings?
JODY: No. It's the truth.
FERGUS: Well, I could say the same about you.
JODY: Could you?
FERGUS: But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
JODY: So I've noticed.
JODY: Hey --
FERGUS: What is it now?
JODY: You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
FERGUS: Do what?
JODY: Kill me.
FERGUS: What makes you think that?
JODY: They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
FERGUS: They won't let him die.
JODY: You want to bet?
FERGUS: I'm not a gambling man.
JODY: And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
FERGUS: Why can't we?
JODY: Not in your nature.
FERGUS: What do you know about my nature?
JODY: I'm talking about your people, not you.
FERGUS: What the fuck do you know about my people?
JODY: Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
FERGUS: Shut the fuck up, would you?
JODY: And you know the funny thing?
FERGUS: No, what's the funny thing?
JODY: I didn't even fancy her.
FERGUS: Didn't look like that to me...
JODY: She's not my type.
JODY: C'mere.
FERGUS: No.
JODY: Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
FERGUS: What?
JODY: My inside pocket.
