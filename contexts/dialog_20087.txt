ZACK: I want to fly, sir!
FOLEY: That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
ZACK: I want to fly jets, sir!
FOLEY: Why? Because you can do it alone?
ZACK: No, sir!
FOLEY: What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
ZACK: I don't want to do something anybody can do.
FOLEY: Pity you don't have the character.
ZACK: That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
FOLEY: Not a fucking chance, asshole!
