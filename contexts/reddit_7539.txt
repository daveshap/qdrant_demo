Negotiating Conference Funding
I’ve unofficially accepted a PhD in ecology. I’m wondering if I should try to negotiate conference funding with the PI before officially accepting the position? Does anyone have experience with this? What kind of funding arrangements are typical? How do people usually fund conference trips?
