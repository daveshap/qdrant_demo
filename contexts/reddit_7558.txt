Anyone from NYU School of Professional Studies?
Anyone here an alumni, current student, or has applied to the Master's in Global Affairs at the School of Professional Studies (or just SPS in general)? I have a couple questions which I would greatly appreciate if anyone answered:

- Can the program be finished in one year instead of the two it usually takes?

- How much are tuition costs for a regular student (American citizen, unfunded)?

- Is it possible to transfer gracefully into an academic PhD program after? I know it's very much a professional school and degree, so I was curious if it was possible to use this as a stepping stone along your way into an academic career. Any anecdotal stories or data-driven stuff appreciated!

Thank you so much! It's remarkable how rarely I've seen this program discussed online, so apologies in advance for the baby-tier questions!
