BEN: Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
CINDY: I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
BEN: What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
CINDY: I never fucked Rod.
BEN: Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
CINDY: If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
BEN: As fucking if.
