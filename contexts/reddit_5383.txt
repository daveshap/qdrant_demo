How to be less stressed/on edge at work?
Hi all,

So I am returning to my summer job in a few days, at which my anxiety is returning at full force. Little context: I work at an architecture firm where I'd like to think I am a valued employee (have received compliments about my progress, been given raises, etc). But it is a huge field with lots of drawings/contractors/knowledge that are prone to mistakes.

Basically my fear comes from making mistakes and being disciplined - basically the idea of being given responsibility and letting others down or being punished and being at fault. It's to the point where all day I am constantly shaking in fear of messing up or worrying about the next new task I'll be given and whether or not I will be able to figure it out or mess up royally. I just know if something happened I'd feel so very ashamed and upset at myself. Now my bosses are not bad people and they are not the cause of my anxiety I believe, as it is more internal attributions that cause these feelings. They have never directly given me cause to think that any mess up by me would result in a yelling session or an immediate firing.

Do you have any ideas on how to change my way of thinking that this is simply something I do for money rather than a 9 hour fight-or-flight panic attack for survival? It almost is part of my identity and that if something bad happened that I could never recover or it would be life-changing. My ego is so afraid of looking dumb or letting down others that I am a perfectionist and cannot accept any less, otherwise the worst might happen. I'm always looking busy because I'm afraid of getting a new task which I have a new opportunity to fail.

Thank you all very much and have a lovely day.
