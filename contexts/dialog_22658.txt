CINDY: That's it. Back to obedience school.
MAGGIE: Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
PEGGY: You're a goddess!
MAGGIE: I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
PEGGY: Stop it. When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
IKE: Hello. I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter. There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
PEGGY: Are you a reporter?
IKE: What?
PEGGY: It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
IKE: About her upcoming wedding and all.
PEGGY: No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
IKE: I am just such a reporter. And you are?
PEGGY: Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater.
