ROLLO: Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
JUNO: Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
ROLLO: Well, you know where the lavatory is. You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
JUNO: Jesus, I didn't say it was.
ROLLO: Well, it's not. You're not a lion in a pride! These kids, acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their Sunny Delights.
