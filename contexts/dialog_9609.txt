RAMBO: You really got a Masters Degree?
CO: Sure. I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
BREWER: What's this stuff on the rice?
RAMBO: Fermented fish sauce.
RAMBO: How do we get upriver?
CO: I have arranged transportation. We meet soon. But I think you to be disappointed.
RAMBO: Why's that?
CO: I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there. Empty for years.
RAMBO: Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
BREWER: Who cares? Let's just do it and get out. Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok. Know what I mean?
RAMBO: We'll check it out.
BREWER: How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
RAMBO: Brewer. Does a jet make noise?
BREWER: Yeah...
CO: Where did you find this clown?
RAMBO: I thought he was with you.
CO: Crazy motherfucker.
BREWER: What's she saying?
RAMBO: She likes you. Says you're dinky- dau.
BREWER: What's that?
RAMBO: Powerful warrior.
BREWER: Yeah. Dinky-dau, that's me. Hey, Co. You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?
BREWER: These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
RAMBO: Sometimes they do. They're river pirates. Opium runners.
BREWER: Pirates? No kidding?
