BEN: Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
BEN: Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
MRS. ROBINSON: But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
