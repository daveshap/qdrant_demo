BARBARA: You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
MRS. FARREN: My daughter died long ago.
EDWARD: Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
AMY: But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
EDWARD: Bad luck to see death in the snow.
AMY: But what happened to the little deer?
EDWARD: Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
AMY: Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
EDWARD: Because it can't. It's dead.
AMY: But it was alive â€” it was fast and strong!
EDWARD: It got hit.
AMY: But where has it gone? Where's all the strength and the quickness?
