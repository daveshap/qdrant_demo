Various GAships, or just one? Which is better?
Hi, r/StudentAffairs!

I'm in a two-year masters program, and right now my assistantship is in res life. Of course, I'm learning valuable transferable skills, but I 100% know that I'm not interested in working in res life when I graduate. 

My question is, should I stay with my assistantship for another year, or try to land one in a different functional area? Do hiring managers for entry-level positions have a preference for multiple GA experiences versus just one?

Thanks for your input!
