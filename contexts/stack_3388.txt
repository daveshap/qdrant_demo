Why are HYDRA agents so committed that they nearly always chomp a suicide pill when defeated? In the Marvel movies Captain America and S.H.I.E.L.D. are opposed by the evil society HYDRA. Whenever a HYDRA agent is defeated or captured, they (almost) without fail chomp a suicide pill and utter the words 'Hail HYDRA!'Why are HYDRA agents, both in WW2 and the present day, so uniquely committed to their organisation?I am most interested in informed answers based on the movies, but supporting evidence from the comics will also be considered helpful.
