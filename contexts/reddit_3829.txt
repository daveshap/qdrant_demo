Deleted all the apps
I went and deleted the dating apps from my phone. I was becoming too  enamored with the hits on my profile, the flirty conversations, which almost always lead to nothing. Time to be in the present and read a good book instead of worrying about who swipes which way on my picture. I know I may be back on them in a while, but right now I need to breathe. And be okay with being alone.
