Girlfriend
Can some of you help? My girlfriend is saying all the time that I am trying to hit on her friend (which I am not). She has started so many fights about it that I am tired of it. So can you tell me is she doing some twistd test OR is she serious. And if she is serious can somebody help me to prove that I am not hitting on her friend?
