Entering the field with a Bachelor's degree
Hey everyone. I am graduating college this spring with a bachelors degree in psychology. I considered graduate school - hell, I even did months worth of research all to realize that as of right now, I do not have any interest in continuing my studies right away. I want to enter the workforce and get my life started first. What is your advice for someone in my position? I want to become hired at a college or university in advising. 

* I have 2-3 years worth of experience, including 2 summers of internships.
* This summer I wrote a 32-page proposal regarding PhD committees for the school I worked for.
* I have many courses relating to diversity and inclusion- something I know is very important to the field of higher ed and student affairs.

What is your advice? Thank you.
