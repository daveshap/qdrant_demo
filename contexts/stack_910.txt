How to send and receive packages from phone to computer I want a way to \"control\" my PC without any third party program. Let me explain more. Few days ago I found the Wake On LAN feature, I set it up to my PC and I found it very useful and convenient. I want to set up something similar. I want to send packages from my android phone directly to my computer (like the magic packet mentioned earlier) and then the computer to run a certain python script which I will program. Yes I know that I can set up an Apache web page and run scripts from there but I found it very difficult to set it to run scripts plus that I'll have to open the browser, type the URL and then press the button on the web page. On the other hand, with the packages it will be quicker to send it since it will require less clicks and effort (at least if it is similar to the magic packet...)Note that I don't have a degree or something (in fact I still go to school), I'm just interested in computers.If that helps, here is my OSUbuntu 18.04.1 LTS
