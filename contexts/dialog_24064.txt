MARY LAZARUS: Very nice. Sisters, have we learned our lesson? I won't hold this little episode against anyone. I'll try not to.
CHRISTY: Mary Robert.
MARY ROBERT: What?
CHRISTY: Mary Robert, I've watched you. You never really sing. You whisper. Nothing comes out.
MARY ROBERT: I don't want to mess anyone up...
CHRISTY: Give me a C. A C!
