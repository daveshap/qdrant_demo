FRIDA: What?
GREGORY: I really gotta pee.
FRIDA: You should have gone at the restaurant.
GREGORY: I didn't have to pee then.
FRIDA: My apartment's just such a mess.
GREGORY: That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
FRIDA: Oh come on. Knock it off.
GREGORY: Knock what off?
FRIDA: You don't have to pee.
GREGORY: Yes I do have to pee!
FRIDA: You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
GREGORY: I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
FRIDA: Uh huh. So pee.
GREGORY: So pee? Here?
FRIDA: Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
