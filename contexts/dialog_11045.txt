FANUCCI: Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little. Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?
VITO: My two friends have my share of the money. I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.
FANUCCI: You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner. Don't be afraid to tell them. Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things. Let yourself be guided by him. He has more experience in these matters.
VITO: You must understand, this is all new to me...
FANUCCI: I understand...
VITO: But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
FANUCCI: You're a good fellow.
