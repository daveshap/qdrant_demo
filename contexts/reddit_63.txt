Hesitant to Start Birth Control
Hi all,

I’m a girl and i’m 17 y/o. Recently I decided I wanted to start birth control and have been given the prescription to pick it up at the pharmacy already. But i’m kind of scared to start it. I’m afraid it will mess up my period cycle and possibly give me side effects such as harsher cramps etc. I don’t really know if I should start it. This is a completely optional thing that I had originally thought of myself but now i’m weary about it. My boyfriend doesn’t mind if I take it or not and says it’s up to me because ultimately it affects me but I just don’t know how it could possibly change my body and if it’s a good decision to make. 

I’m hoping to get some advice or just find how it has affected anyone else, Thank you in advance.
