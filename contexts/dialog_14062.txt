JULIE: Ray...what are you doing?
RAY: Oh...it's not working right. You're home early. Did I scare you?
JULIE: Never do that again.
RAY: Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay. We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
JULIE: I love it here.
RAY: It's gonna be great.
RAY: Checking the locks again?
JULIE: You know me to well.
