JUD: What say, Louis?
LOUIS: Nothing. Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
JUD: We're still not where we're going.
LOUIS: What do you mean?
JUD: The place we're going is on the other side of that.
LOUIS: We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
JUD: No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
LOUIS: I'm not climbing that.
JUD: Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
