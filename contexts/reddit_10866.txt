I tried to ask my family for help, and their answer is "God".
Im from a third world country, and my entire family is very religious, I'm not. 

While I respect their choice to belive in something, they dont respect mine. They think that depression is a joke, that it's just an excuse for "lazy" people. I tried to explain to them how the human body works, but a simple concept like cells and hormones doesnt make sense to them.

Im alone. Im 20, I dont have a job, I dont have friends, and the only joy that I have in this world is to talk with my "online friends" and that is starting to fade away. I never met my mother and my father ( the only person that tried to help me get out of this hole ) hanged himself 2 years ago, and now I have to hear things like "he is going to end like his dad if he doesnt find God".

Help me internet.
