I'm a recent economics graduate, and can't land an entry level position anywhere. What am I doing wrong? Help with my resume please!
I recently graduated with a B.A. in economics on September 2019 from a pretty good school, and have been applying for digital marketing and analyst jobs all over Linkedin and directly on company websites. Since I wasn't able to find any success after a month of doing that, I spent my entire November learning applicable tools that a digital marketer might need (Google Analytics, HTML, etc.) and got some certifications.


I'm still not getting any replies back, and am starting to feel a little depressed from all the ghosting and rejections. I even personalize my cover letter for the companies that require them. Right now, I feel like a huge burden and a failure to my parents since it's been 3 months after I started my job hunt, with nothing to show for it. I'm not sure if it's because my resume is bad or not, so I was hoping to get some input for it to be sure.
