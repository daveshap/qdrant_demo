RENNIE: I can't swim.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: I gathered that.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me. I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
RENNIE: It's not that simple.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
RENNIE: Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: When did this start?
RENNIE: About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: After your parents passed away?
MISS VAN DEUSEN: Did you have an accident in the lake?
RENNIE: No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
MISS VAN DEUSEN: Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
