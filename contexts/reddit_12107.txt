I'm having trouble listening to music with earphones.
Any helpful answer would be appreciated. I don't know whether this post is irrelevant, but I'd appreciate some advice. I've been using in-ear earphones and my ears get tired and hurt, only a bit, within the first ten minutes. The earphones I use are quite decent I think, not expensive though. I listen at an almost satisfyingly loud volume, I don't consider it to be too loud, but after a couple of minutes the sound feels a bit muddy and my ears hurt. I always listen to music while being in a quiet room. Should I consider buying a new, more expensive pair of noise-cancelling earphones? Has the bass volume anything to do with this? Should I afford over-ear earbuds, in order to stop hurting my ears, while I listen at a somewhat loud volume, without decreasing the quality that in-ear earphones offer?
