I didn’t get the job
I have been applying for jobs since August last year. 

Recently I had an interview for a luxury brand. Today the manager informed me that I didn’t get the job. I did a floor trial and I actually enjoyed it and I liked the other employees too. 

I finally thought this would work. But nope.

I don’t know if it’s me but I have the skills. I’m starting to lose hope of actually getting a job and it’s starting to feel crap. 
I know people who apply and get a job straight away but with me it’s different. 
They reject my application despite all the skills I have and it just sucks.
