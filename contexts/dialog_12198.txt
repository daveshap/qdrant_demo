JAKE: You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
NIKI: At least I'm a growing person.
JAKE: You won't keep growing at this rate.
NIKI: What rate?
JAKE: You know what I'm talking about.
NIKI: You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what? You can't even say it, can you?
JAKE: Say what?
NIKI: 'Sucking off.'
JAKE: Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
NIKI: You don't understand shit.
JAKE: Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
NIKI: Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
JAKE: Is that the way it was with you?
NIKI: No. But does it make any difference? How did you get to be the way you are?
NIKI: Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto. Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
JAKE: You used to work at Copper Penny?
NIKI: No.
JAKE: You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
NIKI: Why? Are you a sex fiend?
JAKE: No.
NIKI: Neither am I.
JAKE: But it's all you do.
NIKI: How important do you think sex is?
JAKE: Not very.
NIKI: We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.
