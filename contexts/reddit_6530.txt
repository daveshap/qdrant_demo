Are these signs of a scam?
Applied to a job and they got back to me rather quickly for an interview. They included their [website](http://www.thelaagency.com/) in the confirmation email they sent me so I went to look at it and none of it makes much sense. Very vague and general sounding. Couldnâ€™t find anything else about them online either... no social media accounts, no reviews, no mentions. The position is for an event assistant... is that another way of saying sales job with a high turnover rate? 
Anyway, I just posted to get some second opinions in case someone else has heard of them. This is in the LA area, btw.
