CAPTAIN: How about a drink ?
WILLARD: Sure, thanks.
CAPTAIN: Winning the war by yourself.
WILLARD: Part.
CAPTAIN: Which part is that ?
WILLARD: My part. Beer, with ice and water.
CAPTAIN: That's good gin.
WILLARD: I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
CAPTAIN: Delta ?
WILLARD: No.
CAPTAIN: North ?
WILLARD: Yeah. Way north.
CAPTAIN: What unit were you with ?
WILLARD: None.
CAPTAIN: Rangers, eh?
WILLARD: Sort of.
CAPTAIN: Were you Longe Range Recon --
WILLARD: No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
CAPTAIN: That's quite an array of ribbons...
WILLARD: Let's talk about you.
CAPTAIN: I was an FO for the 25th.
WILLARD: Tracks ?
CAPTAIN: Yeah.
WILLARD: Fat. That's real fat.
CAPTAIN: Sometimes.
WILLARD: At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
CAPTAIN: Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
WILLARD: You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them. I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
CAPTAIN: I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
WILLARD: We do.
CAPTAIN: How long were you up there ?
WILLARD: A long time.
CAPTAIN: A year ? Waiter another beer.
WILLARD: I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
WILLARD: What do you want ?
CIVILIAN: If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
WILLARD: Whose orders ?
CAPTAIN: Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
WILLARD: Who are you ?
