only 9% of marijuana users become addicted. I am one of that 9%
I have smoked everyday, all day since the first time I smoked. I have been wanting to quit for years now. But every time I attempt I relapse. and by relapse I mean dive in worse than before. when I'm high I feel guilty and think about how I don't want to smoke again. when I'm sober I only think about getting high. its a horrible, endless cycle. is there anyone out there that has been in this awful position? I'm just looking for some guidance and inspiration.
