CAUCHON: But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
BUCK: We want her burned as a witch!
CAUCHON: But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...

D'ESTIVET: You told us about the appearance of this... voice. What exactly did you see? Part of it... or all of it?
JEANNE: His face.
D'ESTIVET: Does he have hair?
JEANNE: Yes.

JEANNE: I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.

JEANNE: Go on to the next question.
D'ESTIVET: That's enough! You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
