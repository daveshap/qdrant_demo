Why do I feel like this?
(21F) Hello guys not sure if I’m posting this correctly but I am really struggling with my emotions at the moment. I find myself up and down these last couple of months. One minute I’m ok, the next minute the smallest thing can happen and I’m a wreck. I cry, shake, can’t eat, just want to lock myself in a room. I also feel like my partner is doing things to spite me to make me feel like shit, he knows I’m up and down I’ve spoke to him and asked him to bare with me whilst I try to deal with how up and down I am. He says he’ll support me but when it comes to it he screams at me calls me a brat, an idiot, a bitch and I honestly just feel like I’m on my own. Can someone give me recommendations to try to manage my emotions please? Thank you
