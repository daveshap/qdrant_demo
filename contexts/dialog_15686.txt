JACK: I don't care. Hank. End it.
HECTOR: <u>No</u>. Look. He's got nothing left.
JACK: Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
HECTOR: I'm okay.
KELLY: You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
JACK: Get him onto shore.
KELLY: He heeds a tourniquet.
KELLY: You're gonna be okay.
HECTOR: Guess I finally got bit.
KELLY: Yeah, you got bit. I'm gonna fix it.
KEOUGH: He's done. He's dying.
JACK: Don't count on it. We better take him out.
