What is the difference between Silhouette Index vs Dunn Index vs Davies-Bouldin Index I would like to know whether there is any condition that using one cluster evaluation methods (Dunn, Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin) is better than others. I didn't find anything online or inside books, except a short descriptions that Dunn index is good for non-convex shaped clusters, but didn't find a proper justification for this claim.
