Are there any medical coders in here? Can you tell me about it?
Hi there, I'll keep things short. My current job is incredibly slow, and didn't pay well in the first place. Due to unnatural confidence issues, I've always stayed at this one job (carpet cleaning), from the ages of 20 to 29. I have a new boss as of a year ago, and he can't get business to save his life. My savings are being dug into. I'm under $2K in my personal savings, though I do have a windfall in a separate account of about $30K, so I'm not desperate, but I also do NOT want to rely on that money. If I do, it'll be gone before I know it.

Life specific details out of the way, that brings me to the point of this thread. Can any medical coders tell me how you feel about the job? Specifically:

1. Is it a low/medium stress environment?
2. Is it good for someone that has a history with (but is also getting over) social anxiety?
3. How much schooling is typically required?
4. How much does the schooling typically cost?
5. Are there opportunities for part time and full time work?

I'm ready to turn things around, and I have no idea how I got started on thinking about medical coding, but from what I have seen, it could be right up my alley. I'm a pretty frugal guy, and I'm just looking for something with ok pay and, most of all, stability. Not just in pay and hours, but in the work load that comes in. I'm not a fan of surprises, I prefer my work days to be somewhat predictable.

Thanks to any that read this! And feel free to give other advice that might match my circumstances above.
