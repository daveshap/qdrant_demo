Does one age quicker at higher altitudes? See title: Does one age quicker at higher altitudes? A few years ago I heard that you would age slightly faster (or slower) at higher altitudes. Is this true? What is the theory or evidence for this?Or to put it a little differently: Does time move faster or slower at higher altitudes?
