I'm unattractive.
I'm ugly. My girlfriend tells me I'm attractive and sometimes I convince myself that she's not lying but I'm really not. I know there is more to life than being attractive but it is all I ever think about. I'm young, I have a good body and I make an effort to look good yet I still hate the way my face looks. I don't know how to accept how I look.
