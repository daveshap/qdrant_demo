LEDNOV: I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
FOWLER: Well, say it.
LEDNOV: What's the matter -- restless?
FOWLER: Yes, people make me restless.
LEDNOV: Even women?
FOWLER: There aren't any women here.
LEDNOV: I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
FOWLER: Some people who went by this way lost it. Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
LEDNOV: And you're all alone.
FOWLER: Yeah.
LEDNOV: Suppose I take a look.
FOWLER: Go ahead.
