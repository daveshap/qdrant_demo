College is stupid and it makes me want to die even more
I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with my school in particular. They never even showed me how to schedule an advisor meeting. I started out with 4 classes and had to drop two of them because I was failing (both grades below 50%) and these profs couldn’t teach if you put a gun to their heads. 

Now I have this whole English research paper to write on some bullshit topic I chose and we have to “collaborate” and “brainstorm” in class with people who are writing COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PAPERS. It’s fucking stupid. They’re not sharing my grade why should I have to ask for their help?? I keep skipping class cause I don’t want to go through that bullshit even if my grade suffers.

I think I’d be happier dropping out, living with my parents, and just working two jobs so I can focus on my side hustle. It’s just hard when my parents are immigrants and they keep telling me I’m wasting the opportunity they gave me. 

I don’t know. I just know I can’t take this shit anymore.
