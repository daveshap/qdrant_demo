Very embarrassing but I’m still unemployed after a year since graduation
I made a throwaway because of how embarrassed I am.

So I have a degree in digital marketing and I can’t even land an interview (haven’t landed one since December of last year).

Some background I:

-Graduated with a 2.8 (not good I know)

-Had 3 internships over 3 semesters (all in a related field) 

-I’m currently apprenticing in marketing

-I have a portfolio and professional website. I’ve been told repeatedly by professionals that it’s a good portfolio

And I’ve had nothing. It’s frustrating because I don’t work and I live at home. When I get rejected for jobs (like the four I’ve gotten interviews to) I’m never told why. I get a form rejection. Every time I follow up asking why, I don’t get a response so I stopped asking.

I’m at 100+ resumes, 4 interviews have come out last year and none at all this year. I do reach out to recruiters and personalize my resume and cover letter. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

I really can’t afford to go back to school and my grades weren’t good enough to enter grad school. I’m just at a loss.

It’s killing me too. I can’t make friends and I can’t even start a relationship because I’m always asked what I do for a living, and when I say I’m unemployed people just assume that I’m not trying hard enough. It feels really patronizing because I’m doing all that I can and it’s still not warranting anything.

**Edit:** Can we be civil please? It’s a shame that I have to ask this on a **career driven subreddit**, y’all should know how to act. I know this is the internet and that you probably want to be an asshole because you can’t be one in real life. But find someone else. I’m asking for help. Not generic bullshit or ignorant responses.

**Edit:** Secured interview. Let’s make it happen.
