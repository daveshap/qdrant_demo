RICHARD SCRUGGS: Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
MICHAEL MOORE: Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Mike's our Attorney General down here. I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
MICHAEL MOORE: Right.
RICHARD SCRUGGS: Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out... However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
MICHAEL MOORE: Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
