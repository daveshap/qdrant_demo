Does forceloading chunks put a lot of stress on the server For a project on a minecraft server I used the new /forceload command to keep some chunks loaded. There is probably about 10 chunks not counting the spawn chunks that are forceloaded. I've also noticed that the server's memory usage has gone up as well as the \"Running behind\" messages. There has also been an increase in players so that could also be the issue. In my mind it's not that much different than having another player on, but does it put a bit more stress on the server because they are in various location and not grouped together (more like 10 players instead)? This is in 1.13.2 minecraft with vanilla server.
