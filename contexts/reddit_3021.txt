Do you want free career counseling from Stanford grads?
Hi guys, 

In honor of the holiday season, my friends and I wanted to do something useful for the community by providing free career counseling.  Do any of the following apply to you?

1) You're looking to discover your passion and purpose as it relates to your career
2) You're looking to get ahead in your current job
3) You want help transitioning industries?

If so, we want to help!  My friends and I (there are 7 of us) have full time jobs in our respective fields in tech, law, medicine, non-profits, and finance. Our goal is to give back to the community, and help others by providing career counseling when we're not at our full time jobs. We've worked at places like Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, UCSF, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, Stanford. We're a group of friends who realized we've been lucky in life and want to help others.

Here's how it works: 
1) Email us with a little info about yourself (name, age, email, current profession, linkedin profile if you have one) and what you're looking for help with. 
2) We'll email you back with a profile of someone who can help, and you can decide if you want to speak with him or her.
3) You will get to schedule an one hour phone call with this person. Please come prepared with questions in advance!

The cost is FREE. We're doing this to give back to the community. However, we ask that you come prepared and then pass on the goodwill to others by potentially volunteering with us in the future.
