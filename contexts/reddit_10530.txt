I’m currently looking at train tracks from a bridge
One moment I am so ready to throw myself on those tracks, the next the fear comes in and I’m terrified. I’ve been standing here for about an hour. I don’t know how much longer I’ll be here. It is terrifying but the urge to just get it over with is so strong. I’ve waited so long for things to change and it just seems like it’s not going to happen for me. I would rather not have to live in agony every day. I wish there was an easier way to do this. I’m just waiting for a fast enough train to come along so I’ll be sure it’ll be instant. But I’m scared

edit - I’m still here, I was too scared to do it
