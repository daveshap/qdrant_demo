LOOMIS: Jesus!
BRACKETT: You all right?
LOOMIS: Sure...
BRACKETT: Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
LOOMIS: You have the wrong feeling.
BRACKETT: You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
LOOMIS: Exactly what do you need?
BRACKETT: Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
LOOMIS: I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
BRACKETT: More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
LOOMIS: They could be.
BRACKETT: I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
LYNDA: Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
BOB: Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
LYNDA: You idiot!
BOB: ...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
LYNDA: Totally...
