AUNT EM: Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
MISS GULCH: Now you're seeing reason.
DOROTHY: No --
MISS GULCH: Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
DOROTHY: Oh, no, no! I won't let you take him! You go away, you....! Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
AUNT EM: Dorothy!
DOROTHY: You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto! Don't let her take him -- please!
MISS GULCH: Here! I've got an order! Let me have...
DOROTHY: Stop her!
