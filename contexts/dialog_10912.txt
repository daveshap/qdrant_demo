JORDAN: Who is it?
WICKWIRE: You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
JORDAN: Wick. They got your crew, too?
WICKWIRE: Intagliata was out chasing breakfast. They found his tracks. Well, shit.
JORDAN: You really came back for more? Of this?
WICKWIRE: When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother. He was Spec-Recon. And the stories he used to tell...
JORDAN: If you got a good one, Wick...
WICKWIRE: One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline. This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense. So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone. But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
JORDAN: They had to kill 'em?
WICKWIRE: Nah, they were dead-ass asleep. But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette. Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
JORDAN: That's a good story.
WICKWIRE: So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there? Brother said it was worth it. Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
JORDAN: He was married?
WICKWIRE: At first.
JORDAN: You got anybody, Wick?
WICKWIRE: Not me. You?
WICKWIRE: O'Neil?
JORDAN: How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
WICKWIRE: Last time I didn't.
JORDAN: Let's keep talkin', Wick. Just keep talkin' to me...
