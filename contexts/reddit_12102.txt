I can't stop thinking about a girl... unfortunately she's married
I met her about a month ago at work (I work in a building of about 500 people), and we hit it off from the start. She was engaged at the time, so I didn't want to make a move. The next weekend we went out drinking and she started making out with me. The hanging out/making out continued for a few days, then she got married. We haven't hung out since her marriage a few weeks ago but I can't stop thinking about her. I see her almost every day at work which makes it even worse. I have morals so I really don't want to get involved with a married girl, but this is really bothering me.
