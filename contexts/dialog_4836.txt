CAPT. BARNEY: You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
FRANK: No ...
CAPT. BARNEY: I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time. I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
FRANK: What if there is no tomorrow?
CAPT. BARNEY: Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug. I love this guy.
