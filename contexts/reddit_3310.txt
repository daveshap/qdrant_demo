Any advice for an extremely indecisive person trying to choose a career?
Hey guys, so here’s the deal. I’m 23 and ever since I graduated high school, I’ve been working and taking community college classes on and off. I have considered several different career options only to change my mind about them. I feel like I overthink every aspect of it and at this point, I feel like I need to just choose something and go for it even if it may not seem like my “dream job” because I don’t want to keep wasting time being wishy washy. I want to get my adult life started already. So I guess I’m wondering if you guys have any advice on what I should do about this predicament. I don’t want to feel like I’m settling but I also don’t want to keep wasting time.
