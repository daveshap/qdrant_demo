Funding for masters degree
Hi, I’m currently a PhD student in mechanical engineering. I just finished up my first semester, but I’m considering switching from the PhD program to the masters program at the same school. If I do this, I may lose funding and have to pay my way through the  rest of the masters (most likely one year). I’m at an expensive school, so I would hope to find some ways to ease the financial burden.

Does anyone know of any good places to look for fellowship, scholarships, or any source of funding? Any advice would help
