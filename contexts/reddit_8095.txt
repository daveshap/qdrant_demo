[META] r/NeutralPolitics is opting out of r/all, and by extension, r/popular
EDIT:

To those joining us from r/all and r/popular:

We purposely posted this announcement a day in advance to give frequent visitors an opportunity to subscribe before we disappear from those pages, not expecting that the post itself would make it to the top of r/all. Sorry if this generates any confusion.

If you're a new subscriber, welcome! Please [**read the guidelines**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) before participating.

Dear users,

Over the last few weeks, a number of posts from this subreddit have hit r/all and/or r/popular.

The appearances in those places have driven considerable traffic to the subreddit and swelled our subscriber numbers, but have also attracted contributors who are not only unaccustomed to our rules, but have no interest in abiding by them. This, in turn, has diminished the quality of discourse in the comments and increased the workload for the mods.

So, although growth has its benefits, we’ve determined that the growth we receive from r/all and r/popular is not the kind that is beneficial to this subreddit, especially with the current state of the larger Reddit culture.

Therefore, as of tomorrow, we will opt out of r/all, and consequently, r/popular. From then on, **if you want to see posts from r/NeutralPolitics on your front page, you’ll have to be subscribed and logged in.**

We do expect this to slow our growth, so if you happen to participate in conversations elsewhere with people you think would appreciate this kind of political discussion environment, feel free to refer them here, because we’re unlikely to attract many subscribers from other avenues after this move.

Thank you.
