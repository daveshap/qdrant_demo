For a twist on the usual posts here. I am not debt-free, but I did discover that if you mix 1:1 mushrooms and mince you can make twice as many burgers.
Fed my family of 4, with plenty leftover. I (badly) estimate £0.90 per head

Quick edit for accuracy.

Mince beef (Ground beef for my American cousins): £1.55 500g - Aldi

Buns: £1 for 8 (Could have got cheaper on offer) - Warburtons

Cheese: £1.79 400g - Aldi

Tomato: 6 for £0.60 - Aldi

Mushrooms: 6 for £0.26 - Loose from Saisburys

Little Gem lettuce: £0.60 - Sainsburys

Caveats: My kids are young, I did use butter to toast the buns, I am also terrible at maths.

Edit: I eyeballed the mince to mushroom ratio. It isn't based on weight.
