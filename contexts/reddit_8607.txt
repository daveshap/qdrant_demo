Help me understand current immigration law regarding "chain migration"
After reading [a few](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/07/576301232/explaining-chain-migration) [sources](https://thelawdictionary.org/article/how-does-immigration-sponsorship-work/) my current understanding of "chain migration" is that permanent immigrants need a sponsor with either a green card or citizenship before they are granted permanent residence. When/if that new immigrant gets their green card, they can then sponsor someone else. 

In any single step, **only** parents, children, spouses and siblings of the green card holder can be sponsored, right?

So then the "chain" term comes in when I sponsor my brother, who then sponsors his wife, who sponsors her mom, who sponsors her 5 kids, who then sponsor their 3 siblings each...so my one sponsorship could potentially lead to the sponsorship of people with no relation to me.

Does all that conform to the current law as I've described it? And after that, what does the current administration want to change it to?

Thank you.
