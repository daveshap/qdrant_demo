Guy (35M) I’m (26F) dating said he’s going travelling again in a few months and has decided he doesn’t want anything serious. I’m going to end things now, is this text ok?
Just for background, when we started dating he said he was finally feeling settled being back home and was looking for a relationship. Last night he told me he’s decided he actually wants to go travelling again in a few months so can’t get into anything serious anymore but still wants to see me. I did think about maybe just continuing things and seeing how it goes but decided that I am looking for something serious so that wouldn’t be a good idea. I’m about to send him this text, is it ok?

“Hey you. Thank you for coming last night, I had lots of fun and hope you did too. I’ve been thinking about our conversations yesterday and everything you said. Thank you for being honest with me about where your head’s at, I respect it a lot. I love your company but I don’t think I can put myself in a position where I develop feelings for someone then get hurt later on. I just can’t make myself available in that way when I know I’m looking for something more. I wish it could be different because I do like you but I don’t know what else to do. I’m sorry (name) :(“

EDIT: Updated the text based on your guys’ advice to the following: 

“Hey, thank you for coming last night, I had fun and hope you did too. I’ve been thinking about our conversations yesterday and everything you said. Thank you for being honest with me about where your head’s at, I respect it a lot. I love your company but I don’t think I can keep seeing you when I know that I’m looking for something more. I just can’t make myself available in that way. I wish it could be different because I do like you but I have to do what feels right for me.“

P.S. thank you for all of the reassurance, you guys are the best. This shit is HARD.

EDIT 2: Just sent the text...will update you guys with the response 😬

EDIT 3: His response “Hey (my name),  I hope you’ve had a good day. Yeah I was going to text you too. I thought about the situation too and I also don't think it's fair on you.  Sorry I'm just a bit all over the show,  obviously not ready for something serious it seems :/“

Well. This feels really lame. At least I got in first, I suppose. Just feels like a crappy response after I took so long figuring out what to say. Kind of feel like an idiot. Though I don’t really know what I expected him to say. Ah man.

EDIT 4: For those asking why it felt lame, I guess I just felt like he was trying to save face, but I could be wrong. Maybe I just expected him to respond with something more thoughtful, given he did lead me on into thinking he wanted a serious relationship. I wasn’t hoping he’d try convince me to stick around; my decision was made when I sent that text. I just felt like his response was kind of just “oh yeah, oopsie”. But he probably said all that needed to be said. I’m just tired of dating ok. Let me be pissed off a little haha.

EDIT 5: I responded saying “It’s ok, enjoy your weekend away (he’s going to a festival) and good luck with all of your travels” and he responded “You are a lovely girl, and please don’t think this had anything to do with you :) thank you xx”. Guess I just leave it there hey.
