MARROW: Someone is playing with you.
NELL: Why?
MARROW: I don't know.
NELL: It doesn't matter. Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me. What I do with this is up to me. I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer. And I want to be the volunteer.
MARROW: What is that tune?
NELL: I don't know. A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on. Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
