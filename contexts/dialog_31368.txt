GRADY: Emily?
CRABTREE: Your wife.
GRADY: Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
CRABTREE: Perfect. Well then, shall we?
CRABTREE: Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
GRADY: Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
CRABTREE: If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
GRADY: She's a transvestite.
CRABTREE: You're stoned.
GRADY: She's still a transvestite.
CRABTREE: Mm.
GRADY: Isn't she?
