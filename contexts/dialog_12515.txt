DEAKINS: Not bad. But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story. Network's taking everything we give 'em. They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not. We're very big nationally.
WALLACE: It's a wonderful piece. Emotional. I love it.
DEAKINS: We're gonna feature Gale's cast more. The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story. But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
WALLACE: What about a reward for coming forward?
GALE: There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
DEAKINS: WHAT? THEY FOUND WHAT?
