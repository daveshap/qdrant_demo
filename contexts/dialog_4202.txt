JEFFREY: Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
SANDY: Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
JEFFREY: Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
