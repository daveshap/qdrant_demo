Anybody here gets paralyzed in dating because they think they aren’t good enough for someone?
Does anybody here think that they arent good enough for someone? Im a bit of a perfectionist so everytime someone asks me if Im in a relationship or dating someone, I always tell them that I want my life all figured out before I get into that. I dont know if its just me or someone else gets this type of thought or feeling too. For me, I always want to make sure that I wont have any shortcomings if I ever get into a relationship. I just can’t see myself selling myself short to someone. But all my friends keeps telling me that figuring life all out is impossible because even the richest people in this world have troubles in their relationships too. I dont know, I guess I’m just too much of an idealist/ perfectionist and I guess that’s what is stopping me.
