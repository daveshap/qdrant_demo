Explanation of consistency between Maxwells equations and the existence of photons I have limited knowledge of QM but I know some about electromagnetism.I have read some about the photon description and I am confused.How can EM waves be viewed as a continuous, changing field but at the same time be considered as consisting of a finite number of discrete particles?For example, when considering EM radiation power, the inverse square law applies based upon surface area expansion as you move from the radiating source. How does this work with the photon description?
