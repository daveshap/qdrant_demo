Does an employee recommending you to HR usually guarantee an interview?
I had a great conversation with someone who works at a certain company and they recommended I apply to an open position on their team. I do not believe they are the team leader though. After I applied, I told the person about my application (as they asked me to) and they said they would let the recruiting center know. This person never said "you will definitely get an interview," but they did say a few times something along the lines of "I won't be the one interviewing you since we know each other" and "keep in mind when you are interviewing...."

I am keeping my expectations low--I personally just do not like the idea of expecting good things to come my way (especially when I've only done the bare minimum: submitted an application). However, I am curious if the language my contact used was because companies immediately advance people who have recommendations, or if it is simply their optimism speaking. If anyone knows or has been through this before, please let me know! Thanks in advance for any answers.
