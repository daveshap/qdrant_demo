RANDY: You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
STU: And what would be your motive?
RANDY: It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
DEWEY: A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
TATUM: Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
SIDNEY: God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
DEWEY: Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
TATUM: Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
SIDNEY: Oh, god...
DEWEY: I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
SIDNEY: Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
