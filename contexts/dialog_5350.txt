NICKY: Well...
NICKY: ...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
ACE: Well...
ACE: ...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
NICKY: Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
ACE: She's there with you? She's there with you?
NICKY: Yeah, she's here.
