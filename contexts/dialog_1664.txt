CLAIR: It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours. You know it could be disaster. He's so allergic. It's terrifying.
SALLY: Borrow whatever you like.
CLAIR: I'll change back before we leave.
SALLY: Whatever you like. I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you. Are you alright, Clair?
CLAIR: I'm fine. I'm fine. Well, I'm a little stressed. And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
SALLY: I'd say it was down.
CLAIR: And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy. I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
SALLY: You want a Tylenol, or something?
CLAIR: I'd love a Xanex. Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
SALLY: Why would she care?
CLAIR: You know Sophia. She's so damned judgemental. And she's so damned... perfect. And so fucking... serene. Just fucking don't tell her. Because you know Mac thinks she's God. And I can feel him comparing.
SALLY: You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
CLAIR: Just don't fucking tell her.
SALLY: It's not going to come up.
JOE: Panes! How are you?
PANES: Oh, you know, I am.
JOE: Has she called?
PANES: She'll never call again. She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
