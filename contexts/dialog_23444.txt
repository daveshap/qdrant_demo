GRAHAM: Who are you?
CYNTHIA: I'm Cynthia Bishop.
GRAHAM: Do I know you?
CYNTHIA: I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
GRAHAM: The extrovert.
CYNTHIA: She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
GRAHAM: She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
CYNTHIA: You want me to leave?
GRAHAM: I just want to know why you're here.
CYNTHIA: Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
GRAHAM: No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
CYNTHIA: She still is.
GRAHAM: And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
CYNTHIA: Nope.
GRAHAM: She didn't tell you why she was upset?
CYNTHIA: Nope.
GRAHAM: She didn't give you my address?
CYNTHIA: Nope.
GRAHAM: How did you find me?
CYNTHIA: I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
GRAHAM: I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
CYNTHIA: Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
GRAHAM: Nope. I think the man is a liar.
CYNTHIA: I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
GRAHAM: Spooked.
