I was just offered a new job that will nearly double my current salary!
I am so happy and don't really have many people to share in my excitement. I'm making $21,000 before taxes currently and it's been hard making ends meet. With this new job, my salary is going up to $36,000! I am currently facing an impending separation and divorce and this new job will allow me to provide for my daughter on my own. I will miss my current workplace and job but am so happy I decided to not be complacent with my career goals. I CAN FINALLY START PAYING OFF MY STUDENT LOANS!! 

Edit: wow, thank you for all of your well wishes! I appreciate every single one of them! Just to clarify since I've read some questions and concerns: I'm not planning on a lifestyle creep! I am planning on finally setting up a wifi connection in my house, though. It would also be nice to build savings up to be able to do some outside projects for my house, like building a garage or paving the driveway. As it stands now I am living paycheck to paycheck, so while I'm hoping to save at least 10% per pay period with this new job, I realize things will still be a little tight with me doing things on my own. I will still live for thrift stores, couponing, and weekly sales ;) My current job now is as a 1-1 aide for a behavioral elementary school. My new job will be as a case manager for a mental health agency, helping adults secure things like government benefits, housing, etc. I would like to go back to get my Master's degree in a couple of years to become a social worker. I know non profits aren't the way to make a whole lot of money, but being able to make a difference is something that's very important to me.
