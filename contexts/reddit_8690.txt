What is the reason on why the Federal Government can remove funding because of certain criteria, such as the drinking age, but not others, such as sanctuary cities?
It is commonly known that the federal government got states onboard with 21 and up drinking laws by threatening to withdraw federal highway funds otherwise. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK37599/

However, courts have ruled that the federal government cannot withhold law enforcement funding because of a state or city refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-philadelphia/philadelphia-beats-us-appeal-in-sanctuary-city-case-idUSKCN1Q42BS

Why could the federal government withhold highway funding from states refusing to cooperate with 21 and up drinking laws, but it is unconstitutional for the feds to withhold funding for law enforcement because of a state or municipality refusing to cooperate with immigration authorities? Is it because states passed bills that explicitly defied the federal National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1989, instead of merely ignoring federal authorities?
