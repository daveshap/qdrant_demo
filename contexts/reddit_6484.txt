What should I actively be doing in my job to ensure I keep it?
Hello, long story short. I was dismissed from my first ever job. They deemed my progress to slow but I was never given any warning and prior to this in my last meeting I was told I was doing a great job. And my team member said they would’ve liked for me to have been kept on and said they were happy with the work I was doing. 

I’ve managed to secure a second job now but now I’m very anxious because I gave it my all in my first job and still got the sack and completely blindsided me. Now I’m so worried the same thing will happen again. If i was incompetent then in a way I would be happier because I know what I have to fix but now I’m just nervous because I gave my 100% and it still wasn’t enough. I just don’t want to work and be constantly nervous about my job security. 

Has anyone got any advice?
