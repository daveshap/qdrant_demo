Feeling jaded already
So I'm now halfway through my masters program in higher ed. I'm feeling pretty cynical about the value of the program. I usually take pride in being a good student, but i just can't bring myself to be interested in my classes- they all seem the same. and on top of that I feel like I'm not being incentivized to try my best either I didn't even buy the books this semester and I've done fine. I'm working in higher ed while i do my program and I'm loving my job, so i know i'm interested in the field. Does anyone else feel this way? Any tips on pulling through?
