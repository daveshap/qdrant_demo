Property rights of a 18-year-old
I have a boyfriend whose parents are overbearing and overly controlling. They deny him privacy and threaten to take his belongings away frequently. For context, they’re trying to prevent him from applying to college. He’s trying to move out but needs time. He loves his parents but needs to know what his actual rights are if he chooses to enforce them.


The items that were given to him as gifts are his property correct?   What about items given to him when he was still a minor that he retain possession of into adulthood.  Are those items still his property or the other property of his parents?

At what point is taking away someone’s personal property no longer in the realm of parenting and now is in the realm of criminal theft?

Additionally, he provides labor services to the household is this the basis of payment for tenancy. 
If he is a tenant, does he have the right to quiet enjoyment of his room without his landlord a.k.a. his parents interfering?

If his parents were to tell him to leave does he have rights to notice and due process through evection?
