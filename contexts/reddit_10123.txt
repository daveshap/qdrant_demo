Advice and Input for graduate school
Hey all! I am back and I have made a decision on where I am attending grad school. I have decided to attend my alma mater at James Madison Univeristy for their College Student Personnel Administration program, which is a counseling based program.

As I am gearing up for school I am thinking about the expereince I would like to have in school. My first assistantship with be in leadership education within the Leadership Center on campus. I am also planning out two practicums I would want to do and whaty second assistantship would look like. 

Reflecting on myself and my capabilities and interests, I would be interested in the following areas:

1. TRiO & Higher Education Oportunity/Summer Bridge Programs
2. Academic Advising
3.First-Year Experience (Not New Student Orientation although the two intersect at times)
4. Disability Services and Career Services/Development
6.Enrollment Management (Student Success & Retention)

Really and truly 1. through 3. are ones I could see myself in in the near future.

I was wondering if any of you all would have advice about any of these functional areas? What are some good organizations to check out and literature upon these functional areas? Also if you have any other advice that would be helpful as well!
