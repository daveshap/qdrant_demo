GATEKEEPER: I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
NICKY: Coulda been much worse.
GATEKEEPER: That's what I'm thinkin'...
DAD: This is bad, Nicky.
NICKY: How bad?
DAD: I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
LUCIFER: What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
DAD: Everything's fine, pop.
LUCIFER: Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
DAD: Please, pop, just go back to your room.
LUCIFER: Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
DAD: Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
