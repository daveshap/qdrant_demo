My mother has been looking for a job since 2016 with no luck, does anyone have advice?
I'm a 15 year old who my mom has raised on her own since I was 2. She is a terrific, hard worker. She has been looking for a job since 2016 with no luck. She graduated from a good college, and has a master's degree in Human Resources. She applies for SEVERAL jobs all day every day, and even with the occasional rare interview, nothing ever pans out. I hate seeing her so stressed and she deserves SO MUCH more than what she is getting. Since she doesn't have a job, we don't have enough money for our own apartment and therefore live with my grandparents which puts a strain on both of our mental healths(?). She is determined, great at motivating herself, is very flexible, never complains, and is overall just a REALLY hard worker. She doesn't stop until her task is done. I really wish there was some way I could help her, but I can't. Does anyone here know what to do? She has updated her resume and practiced interviewing many times. She just really needs a good job! 

TDLR; my mother (a terrific, hard worker who has raised me on her own since I was 2) has been looking for a job since 2016 with no luck. She has a master's degree in human resources. Help please.

Edit: For anyone offering to edit my mother's resume-- please PM me! I will forward it to you if you provide me with an email. And thank everyone for all the advice!! We are both thankful.
