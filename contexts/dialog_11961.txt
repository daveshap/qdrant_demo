LEE: Want some coffee or tea?
FREDERICK: No, thank you.
LEE: How about something to eat?
FREDERICK: No, nothing.
LEE: Are you sure?
FREDERICK: Absolutely.
LEE: Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
LEE: God! And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time. I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
FREDERICK: I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people. I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
LEE: You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
FREDERICK: Lee... you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with.
