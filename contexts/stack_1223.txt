Will the foreign key constraint throw an error while restoring a database? I have never faced any issue like this, but I am just curious. Let's say I have a database dump file with me and I want to import the dump file to another database.There are 2 tables table_A and table_B. table_B contains a primary key and table_A contains the foreign key. And serially, table_A is first and then table_B.So, when I update the database table_A will be created with a foreign key and next table_B will be created that contains the primary key.So, will there be any error in this case?
