My school BANNED saying no homo
Yea, my school pretty much banned people from saying no homo. Last week, two or three kids got in trouble for saying no homo and the fucking POLICE were called. An officer INTERROGATED them and said that they couldn't say no homo anymore. The cop pretty much said that "It'S hOmOpHoBiC aNd CrEaTeS a ToXiC eNvIrOnMeNt." So pretty much the school banned saying no homo because some idiot got offended. Now, the school has no defense from potentially gay actions. The school is in chaos rn lmao

Edit: The comments have gotten seriously homophobic,. I can't really control the comments, so I'm sorry to anyone offended

Edit 2: People are telling me that some people are using my post as a way to justify homophobia, which is honestly disgusting.  I want to make it clear that I do *not* condone any of this. I just shared a funny story that happened at school, I did not want to get in the middle of a war.
