Anxiety is just your brain coming up with fake news
Today i learned my anxiety attacks are just like everyone else's , it's really comforting especially when the symptoms makes you feel like you're having a stroke but the neurologist was like :
 "don't worry you're fine"
I didnt believe him at first but now I do !
