Is anybody else feeling pretty squeezed by grocery prices lately?
My household has a budget of $300 per month for groceries and basic household items (think toilet paper, dish soap, etc.) each month. There are two adults in my household, 28F and 29m. I've been easily able to manage this budget over the past couple years, but in the past 3-4 months I feel like food prices have been inching up and everything is starting to get really tight. FWIW, we buy very few non-food items each month, so it's really food costs that are squeezing us.

I buy basic staples (dry beans, rice, bread ingredients, oats, eggs, ground beef, chicken breasts, fresh produce, etc.) and always look for sales. But sales for these items are hard to come by and it's getting depressing looking through store ads now when 90% of it is processed junk. All my staples are sitting on shelves at full price, or the sales seem ridiculous ($3/lb for non-organic apples *on sale*?).

Every week, I shop the three grocery stores close to me (Sprouts, Kroger, Safeway) for lowest prices and will go to other stores like Trader Joe's for a few items the others don't have. Wish we had an Aldi; I think that'd be a huge help.

I've started cutting back on items I used to enjoy and I've been rationing meat way more to spread it out. I've started having 'bean weeks' where I cook up a huge pot of beans and get creative with recipes, because these are so cheap. A lot of the old recipes I used to make and really like are gathering dust because obtaining the ingredients to make even a couple of these per week would easily push us over budget.

I guess I'm just venting or looking for commiseration or something. Every week when I do meal planning it gets me down how much mental energy I'm putting into this just to stay in budget. We are lucky to have the means to increase the budget some if needed but that just means that money isn't going toward one of our other goals. You guys feeling the pinch too, or is it just me?
