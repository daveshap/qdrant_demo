JOEL: Right. Something black though.
CLEMENTINE: I'll buy that. Black's always good.
JOEL: We did talk about Naomi.
CLEMENTINE: I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
JOEL: I'm sure, I said.
CLEMENTINE: But you weren't. I could tell.
JOEL: I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.

CLEMENTINE: So what. Infatuation is good, too.
JOEL: And I didn't have an argument.
JOEL: I dropped you off after. You said --
CLEMENTINE: Come up and see me... now.
JOEL: It's very late.
CLEMENTINE: Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
