TUBBS: Verdado where?
CROCKETT: It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
TUBBS: Havana, Cuba...?
CROCKETT: No. Havana, Louisiana. Don't we have a meet?
TUBBS: ...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
CROCKETT: No.
TUBBS: You're not makin' a move on her...?
CROCKETT: We're makin' moves on each other.
TUBBS: Oh, that makes it okay, then.
