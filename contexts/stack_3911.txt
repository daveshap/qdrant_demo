How to calculate divergence from standard deviation I have 20 people I wish to give performance score every 6 months. I want to identify the weakest performers in the bottom 10 and remove them from the group but only those from the point of the most significant drop in performance. I am willing to accept there may well be a perfectly linear decline in score with no sudden drop however my thinking is that by obtaining the standard deviation amongst the top 10 I can identify the greatest precipice drop amongst the bottom ten.Is standard deviation the correct term to use and how would I go about calculating this ?
