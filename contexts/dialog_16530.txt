BOB: Yeah, its really different here.
LYDIA: Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school. Can I call you in a little while?
BOB: It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
LYDIA: Ok, well... I love you.
BOB: I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
LYDIA: Good-night.
BOB: Hello?
CHARLOTTE: It's Charlotte.
BOB: Charlotte, who?
CHARLOTTE: Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
BOB: Of course.
CHARLOTTE: Do you want to have some breakfast?
BOB: Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
CHARLOTTE: OK, see you downstairs.
CHARLOTTE: Hey look, it's Sausalito.
BOB: I see them every morning.
BOB: Hans was very attentive to you.
CHARLOTTE: I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
BOB: No, its easy.
CHARLOTTE: How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
BOB: I don't know.
CHARLOTTE: Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
BOB: But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
CHARLOTTE: Really?
BOB: Yeah, you don't remember?
CHARLOTTE: Did I scowl at you?
BOB: No, you smiled.
CHARLOTTE: I don't remember.
BOB: I know, I kind of blend in here.
CHARLOTTE: Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
BOB: I don't know. My fax said have a good fright"."
CHARLOTTE: Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
BOB: Ok, whatever you want.
CHARLOTTE: Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
BOB: No, I was looking at you.
CHARLOTTE: Oh. Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
BOB: I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
CHARLOTTE: Oh, for her show?
BOB: No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
CHARLOTTE: Oh.
BOB: You're possessive.
CHARLOTTE: I know.
CHARLOTTE: I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
BOB: No, yes, it does...
CHARLOTTE: Yeah? But look at you.
BOB: Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
CHARLOTTE: I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
BOB: You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
CHARLOTTE: But, I'm mean.
BOB: That's ok.
CHARLOTTE: And marriage, does that get easier?
BOB: It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
CHARLOTTE: Did that help? Did you learn anything?
BOB: We established that we have no communication.
CHARLOTTE: Oh.
BOB: We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
CHARLOTTE: That's too scary.
BOB: When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
CHARLOTTE: No one ever tells you that...
BOB: But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
CHARLOTTE: That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
BOB: Where'd you grow up?
CHARLOTTE: In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
BOB: I know.
CHARLOTTE: John thinks I'm so snotty.
BOB: You are.
CHARLOTTE: I know, but that's what you like about me.
CHARLOTTE: Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
BOB: Because that would be too easy.
BOB: Hello?
RECEPTION: Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
BOB: Ok.
RECEPTION: Do you want I send it to your room?
BOB: Great.
RECEPTION: Thank you, Mr. Harris.
