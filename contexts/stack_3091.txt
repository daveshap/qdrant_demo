Why do lens (convex) not introduce any path difference to light incident on it? My understanding is that the top rays spend less time inside the lens where the speed of light is slow and the middle rays spend more time inside the lens so the time is kind of compensated . But I'm looking for, like a mathematical proof.I'm asking in the context of Huygens' principle Try to not involve quantum mechanics.
