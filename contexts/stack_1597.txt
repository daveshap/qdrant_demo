Recording of sensory nerve evoked potential generated through skin-receptors If we touch / give pressure to a skin, there are many mechano-receptors like meissner/pacinian corpuscles that produce action potential in neurons. I am in a need to detect those action potentials from the skin surface like I give physical stimulus to tip of the finger, then is it possible to record just the spikes whether fired or not in neurons?I mean just the non-invasive circuit which can detect nerve firing and display yes or no.I searched for the last 3-4 months and developed one circuit (instrumentation amplifier + gain stage + filter + surface electrodes), but all efforts in vain. Please suggest me, how to proceed ahead. Is this kind of circuit possible? Or is it (even) available commercially?
