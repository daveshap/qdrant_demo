VOICE #1: My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
VOICE #2: The district attorney's office will comply provided -
VOICE #1: No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
VOICE #2: May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
VOICE #1: Immunity.
VOICE #2: Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
VOICE #1: Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
