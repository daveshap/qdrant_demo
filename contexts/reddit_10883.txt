Took the pills, drink the beer, get cold and post on Reddit before I die.
Been putting off killing myself, but I took the pills (benzos and opiates and can depressant meds) this time, drank some beer to kick it all into gear... Fingers and legs are getting very cold... 

I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone here... You all tried your best

Edit: added some more meds to make sure it does the trick. Just so done

I am so sorry to all of you! I did end up overdosing, but not enough to finish the job. I ended up getting really sick though and puking on pretty much everything. I have a traumatic brain injury (childhood abuse and concussions) and so it affected me a ton because of that. I spent the last several days not able to focus my eyes. I would wander around my room like a zombie, not able to comprehend pretty much anything. I am on a ton of meds for other medical stuff and I got really sick from not taking my meds when I was not able to think clearly. I am finally able to read (and comprehend), otherwise, I would have updated you all... I honestly didn't think my post would get any attention, and I remember only bits and pieces of the last several days. I am still not to 100% but no one knows, except for my friend who has also attempted; I didn't want any judgment. 

I am doing okay, had some SI's creep in again but I beat them back. I am still in a daze that I could have died... and I was, and am still, okay with that, but now it feels like life is super surreal... 

You are all really kind, and seeing this much love from so many strangers has helped me in a significant way
