Adding to Environment Variables <blockquote>  I need to add a folder named \"include\" and a wine executable  \"fasm.exe\" to Environment Variables.</blockquote>The Include folder contains .inc files that are important for code execution. Although I am on Assembly, the purpose of this include folder is quite the same as that of the C include folder.This was quite simple in Windows but I can't figure out a way to do that permanently in Ubuntu 17.10 .
