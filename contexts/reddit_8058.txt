Extramural Fellowships
Hi Everyone, 
Iâ€™m about to begin my PhD program. The website for my school says that I should seek out Extramural fellowships for additional funds, but doesnâ€™t give any information on where I can find them. I have found some information through Google but was looking to find out more. Can someone explain to me what these are, and where I can find them? Also, how many of you have actually successfully received such extramural fellowships? TIA! ðŸ˜Š
