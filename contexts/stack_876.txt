How to have both libcurl3 and libcurl4 installed at same time? My favorite web brower depends on libcurl3 (Opera 36.0) But many apps depends on libcurl4 including PlayOnLinux or Steam client. It will be nice to have PlayOnLinux or Steam installed but I'm not giving up my favorite web browser. Do someone knows workaround how I can have installed both of them ? I readed somewhere that libcurl4 is based on libcurl3 so I have no idea why they keep uninstalling each other.
