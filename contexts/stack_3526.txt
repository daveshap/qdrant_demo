Is it acceptable \"allowed by default, disallowed for specific data/actions\"? A friend told me that in the agile paradigm it is said that users are allowed by default to do anything but then they are blocked or disallowed to access or do certain identified actions. Just the contrary of minimum/least privilege.That is a complete different paradigm where for a new application you identify what generic users cannot do and implement that security, not the contrary.The result may be the same: everyone access what is allowed to access, but the implementation is completely different.In which scenarios is this approach acceptable?May it be secure?
