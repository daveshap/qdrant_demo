Atmospheric correction algorithm in Python or R for Landsat 7 ETM+ I am looking for an algorithm which can be tuned in python or R for atmospheric correction for Landsat 7 ETM. Searching Google I have found only a few algorithms in ENVI or ERDAS which are not possible to alter the parameters or maybe I am wrong. Can anyone help me to find an algorithm sufficient for Landsat 7 in order to perform atmospheric correction?
