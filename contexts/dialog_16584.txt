CONWAY: Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
SONDRA: Bump?
CONWAY: When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
CONWAY: Ouch!
SONDRA: You see, it's not a dream.
CONWAY: You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
SONDRA: Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
CONWAY: It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
SONDRA: Why?
CONWAY: Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
SONDRA: Struggling, why?
CONWAY: Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
SONDRA: Why?
CONWAY: You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
SONDRA: I was just going to.
CONWAY: It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it? Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
SONDRA: Why, mother?
CONWAY: Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
SONDRA: Would you like to wring my little neck?
CONWAY: I'd love it!
SONDRA: Why?
