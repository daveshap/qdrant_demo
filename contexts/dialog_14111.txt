ELLIE: I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
PETER: Well—of all the—well— Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
ELLIE: Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
PETER: Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
ELLIE: What happened?
PETER: That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
ELLIE: What am I going to do now?
PETER: Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
ELLIE: No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
PETER: You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
ELLIE: Why, no—I— Yes . . . I guess I will.
PETER: I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
ELLIE: No. I'd rather you didn't.
PETER: Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
ELLIE: I don't want it reported!
PETER: Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that—
ELLIE: See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported! Please stay out of my affairs! I want to be left alone. A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
PETER: Why, you ungrateful brat!
