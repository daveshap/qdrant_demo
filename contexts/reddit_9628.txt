A little discouraged as a new SA professional
Hello /r/studentaffairs!  Y'all have no idea how happy I am I've found this subreddit. I was honestly surprised that it existed, so thank you for being here and such a great community. 



I just graduated from my graduate program this past May. I've been applying everywhere in the Los Angeles and Orange County area but so far, no luck. I'm getting really discouraged and honestly wondering what to do. I've been also looking for work outside of our field but that hasn't been successful either. I've signed up to a temp agency in order to help myself stay afloat but if any of you could offer any advice, I would really appreciate it. How did you manage your job search? What sorts of things did you do to keep yourself from getting discouraged after rejections/no responses?
