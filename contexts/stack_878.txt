xfce Desktop Doesn't Load In I'm running into this strange issue when using xfce where my desktop (wallpaper + desktop icons) won't load in after a reboot until I log out and back in. I don't believe I messed with any settings that would affect this, but I'm not entirely sure. Do you guys have any solutions other than reinstalling xfce and if not, is there some way to back up my themes + settings so that I can restore them after a reinstall?I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 with xfce as a desktop environment
