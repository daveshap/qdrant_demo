MOORE: Your investment ideas never work out.
BOYD: That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
MICHEAL: Your ideas never work out.
BOYD: Oh really? Starbucks?
ADAM: That's one idea.
FISHER: No...we want padded chairs...okay?
BOYD: One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
ADAM: You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
BOYD: I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I? Prison Communications.
MOORE: I don't think so Boyd.
BOYD: Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
