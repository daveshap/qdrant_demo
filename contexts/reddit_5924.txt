Will I be able to get a job with a Bachelors in Professional Studies(w/ I.T. Conf)?
Little background.  30 something living in rural Tennessee.  Wife and 2 kids.  I've spent the last 13 years as an Assistant Manager at a grocery store.  That basically the extent of my work history.  

I've enrolled in an online degree at a state university.  Fully accredited, etc.  I'm a Senior with a couple semesters left.  Working 50hrs a week its impossible to commute to campus so I'm pretty much locked into an online program. 

Basically, the degree is a mix of business classes and some I.T. classes.  This is the website for an idea of the classes required in the degree:

Basically my question is will this help me get a job in I.T. or am I wasting my time and money?
