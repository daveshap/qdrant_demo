BROWN: And she sent no word down?
ARCHIE: They said you were drunk. Why don't you tell her the truth?
BROWN: She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
ARCHIE: What are you doing?!
BROWN: I'm getting dressed.
ARCHIE: You've got three broken ribs, man!
BROWN: I've got my duties to attend to.
ARCHIE: Don't be an idiot! You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
BROWN: She'll be worried about me.
ARCHIE: She'll get over it.
BROWN: I can't let her down now, Archie.
ARCHIE: And when was the last time she put herself out for you? Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
BROWN: Oh, I'm much more than that.
ARCHIE: Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
BROWN: You watch your tongue.
ARCHIE: Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
BROWN: You know nothing about her!
ARCHIE: When are you gonna see it, John? She doesn't give a damn about you.
