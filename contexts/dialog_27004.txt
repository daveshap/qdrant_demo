LUKE: So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
MARROW: I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily. You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
THEO: When do we take the tests?
MARROW: Every day. Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
