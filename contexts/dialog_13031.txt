TATIANA: What's wrong?
PAUL: I have to go to the Diplomat.
PAUL: General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Whiskey?

GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: I'll be over.
PAUL: Bring back your policemen...
PAUL: We must go to the Diplomat.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Get in.
PAUL: Your police are at the gate?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
