I should have killed myself in high school
I was a fool to think that things would change and that I would actually feel better when I reach college. I was so fucking wrong it’s not even funny.

Life only gets worse from here. I don’t want to be alive to see how it gets worse.

If I had known I would still feel this way by the time I got to college I would have hung myself freshman year of high school
