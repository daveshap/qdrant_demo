Make ArcMap label using the first letter from each word in an attribute How do I create labels using the first letter of each word from a specific attribute, preferably using Python as the parser? For example, the attribute name is Common_Name and the values are eastern white pine, balsam fir, plus many others. Cases may be mixed (e.g. some might be Eastern White Pine or Balsam fir), but I'd like the labels to be all capitols, like EWP and BF, respectively.
