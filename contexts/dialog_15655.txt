KELLY: They respond pretty quick. I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
JACK: Good. See ya soon.
KELLY: Good luck.
HECTOR: Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
KELLY: What? Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
HECTOR: As if. Will you miss me?
KEOUGH: I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
HECTOR: No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
KEOUGH: Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
KELLY: I asked you to be nice to him.
KELLY: He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them. He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
KEOUGH: And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
KELLY: He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
KEOUGH: You like Jack?
KELLY: <u>What</u>? I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
KEOUGH: Hector thinks you like him.
KELLY: Well Hector's a giant cracker.
KEOUGH: You think Jack's handsome?
KELLY: What is this?
KEOUGH: I'm just curious. I can never tell what women think is handsome. Is he handsome?
KELLY: Well. He's probably rugged handsome I guess. Yeah.
