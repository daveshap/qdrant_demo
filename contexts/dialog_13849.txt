WILL: Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat. You remember that?
HAP: You know I remember that.
WILL: One word to I.A. and he walks.
HAP: Maybe not. We could talk to Buck...
WILL: No way.
HAP: Cut some kind of a deal. I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
WILL: Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap! We are nothing like Mike Flynn. We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did. And every bastard like him. We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk. Every last one. And I am <i>not</i> going to let that happen. No deals. No compromises. No discussions.
