TOMMY: Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
LAURIE: Just watch.
TOMMY: Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
LAURIE: Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
TOMMY: I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
LAURIE: See you.
