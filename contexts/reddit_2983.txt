Is it just me or have you found that the friendly smiling coworkers are the ones you have to watch out for?
I have found that many of my coworkers who always had a smile on their face and would be the friendliest were the ones who turned out to be the most duplicitous and backstabbing. 

Has anyone else found this to be true during your years on the corporate culture?

If so, how might one protect themself from such treachery?
