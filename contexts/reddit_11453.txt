The fact that suicide is a thing
For 11 years I struggled with depression and suicidal ideation. Sometimes I spoke to people who had similar issues. About two years ago I was in a mental hospital again and decided that it was time to either kill myself or not. I chose not to kill myself, obviously. Once and for all. Life got a lot better. I believed in my future, life is insignificant but also it is beautiful, blah blah blah. 

One of the people I got closest with while talking about depression and stuff killed himself a few days ago. I am super upset about it. I know life sucks and stuff but he should not have done it. He asked me for help a while ago and I offered him everything I could but he didn't really do anything about it. 

I take life one day at a time and that has worked for me, but it didn't work for him. I am tired of people killing themselves. I wish everyone would just stop killing themselves. And talking about killing themselves. 

I feel like I am supposed to understand because for so long I struggled with it too. "To be or not to be" really is the question, and I guess it is a decision we all have to make. But I can't accept it. 

I am mad at everyone. Life is a weird gift and individually we are so insignificant, but that takes the pressure off, that is part of what makes it beautiful. I am very upset. I miss my friend. I know he made the decision and didn't want to do this anymore. But there was another way out of the misery and the darkness- he did not need to die to get out of it.
