Any CS PhD’s who interviewed at Microsoft?
Hey! I have an onsite interview at Microsoft for PhD Internship, and I was wondering if anyone in this sub has done it recently to get some insight into the process. I got the general advice through the recruiter, but looking for some specifics as I’m completely lost. Majority of the information is geared towards the undergrad internships on the internet. Thank you
