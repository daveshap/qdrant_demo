Does any else get that feeling when you're actually doing well and your mind is at peace and then you get a thought saying "Remember, you're not okay, you should be anxious about something"?
It's so annoying, I'm doing okay and then my brain reminds me "oh you're not okay, remember you've been feeling anxious" and then I get anxious and really, really sad that I'm not fully okay. What do I do about it? It causes me a great deal of distress sometimes.
