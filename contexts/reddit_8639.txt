How to reconcile turnout for the Women's march on Washington with voter turnout for women in 2016?
On January 21, 2017, [an estimated 500,000 protesters](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/womens-march.html?_r=0) marched on Washington to advocate for ["ending violence", "reproductive rights", "LGBTQIA rights", "worker's rights", "civil rights", "disability rights", "immigrant rights", and "environmental justice".](https://www.womensmarch.com/principles)

Some outlets are calling this the ["Biggest Protest In US History As An Estimated 2.9 Million March"](http://www.politicususa.com/2017/01/21/womens-march-biggest-protest-history-estimated-2-4-million-march.html) across the country.  Others cite that the march consists of ["‘Mostly White’ Women Who Need ‘Therapy’ After Clinton Loss"](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/01/21/womens-anti-trump-marchers-mostly-white-need-therapy-clinton-loss/) (note, Breitbart misquoted the Washington Post, which did not mention anything about "therapy").  While the "therapy" part may be inaccurate, the Washington Post does confirm that ["the marchers were mostly female and white"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/womens-march-on-washington-a-sea-of-pink-hatted-protesters-vow-to-resist-donald-trump/2017/01/21/ae4def62-dfdf-11e6-acdf-14da832ae861_story.html?utm_term=.4badd3cae188).

This movement contrasts with election results in November 2016, where [53% of white women voted for Donald Trump.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/white-women-donald-trump-victory)  While [this represents an improvement for the Democratic party from 2012](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/white-women-support-gop/507617/), nonetheless a clear majority of white women voted for Donald Trump.

What do these two events, the white women voter turnout in 2016, and the Women's March in 2017, signify about the political proclivities of this particular demographic?  Why is there such stark divide between the prolific nature of this protest movement and election results, especially considering that MLK's million man march coincides with an [exceptionally strong majority vote by African Americans for the Democratic party?](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/04/blacks-and-the-democratic-party/)
