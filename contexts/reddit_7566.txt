Should I go to grad school?
Hey guys, I'm thinking about doing a master's in Architecture program next year and I am trying to figure out if grad school is even worth the headache. I've heard that many people feel it was a waste of time while many others feel like it was beneficial. I'm just trying to increase my chances of getting a high paying job and I figure this is a good way to do It. I'm also really interested in pursuing architecture as I wasn't able to pursue it for my bachelor's. I also heard that a lot of schools pay for you to do your grad school program but is that common? I wasn't going to do it if I couldn't get funding though, since I don't want to dig myself into a whole of debt. But I am on the fence tbh. Anyone have any advice on what I should do?
