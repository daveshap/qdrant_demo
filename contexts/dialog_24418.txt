WATTERS: ...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
SYKES: I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
WATTERS: He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
SYKES: You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
WATTERS: Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
SYKES: Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
WATTERS: What!?
SYKES: Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
WATTERS: Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
SYKES: -- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
WATTERS: I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets. Plus you stank.
SYKES: Fuck you.
