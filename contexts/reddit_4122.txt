Dating is different now
I just recently had a 10 year relationship end, and am now looking at how dating works in 2019. 

Things are so much different than the last time I met someone. I literally met her in a coffee shop, and now it's Coffee Meets Bagel. There was a spark, and now it's Tinder.

I used to be with ‘it’, but then they changed what ‘it’ was. Now what I’m with isn’t ‘it’ anymore and what’s ‘it’ seems weird and scary. It’ll happen to you!


Update: just got a date the old fashioned way. With a delightful homeless lady in a Walgreens parking lot.
