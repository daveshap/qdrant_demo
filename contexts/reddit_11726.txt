Loneliness is getting the best of me.
I've been single for almost a year now, and it was a horrible break up, for me anyways. Totally caught me off guard. But Especially lately, I've been super lonely. All of my friends don't seem to want to talk to me. I haven't had any sort of physical contact with a girl in a long time, and I think that's whats killing me most. I'm a very affectionate person. I love cuddling, and I feel like nothing would make me happier than to do that again.
