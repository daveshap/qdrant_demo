Thoughts on what to do or feel about friends?
My group of my friends and I were talking and I ended up bringing up something that really affected me and was really personal. One of my friends began making jokes at my expense, and I got really upset. I asked them to stop, but they kept going and laughing at me, even after I began to tear up and had to go inside in order to not cry. A few days have passed since then, and the friend who joked about me hasn’t brought it up, and probably won’t ever bring it up or change his behavior or apologize. Because of that, I want to leave my friend group. But, am I being too sensitive here, wanting to leave over one thing one person said? Should I give things more time? I’m kind of biased so I need some advice from someone else. Any thoughts are very helpful, thanks.
