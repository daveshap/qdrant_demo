EVE: I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
ADDISON: She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
EVE: That's not true!
ADDISON: I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
ADDISON: You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of Cora" - and you lied to me about it!"
EVE: No-no-no...
ADDISON: I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned... ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?
