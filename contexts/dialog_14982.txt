MARK: Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
JUNO: Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
MARK: Shut up.
JUNO: It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
MARK: What do you play?
JUNO: I rock a Harmony.
MARK: Oh.
JUNO: What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
MARK: Sorry. I swear I'm not a gear snob.
JUNO: What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
MARK: Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
JUNO: Yeah.
MARK: Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
JUNO: When was this, like '96?
MARK: '93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
JUNO: Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
MARK: You weren't even alive!
MAC: So. What's that thing?
VANESSA: A Pilates machine?
MAC: What do you make with that?
VANESSA: You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
