Brute-force attack to exe file I have an encrypted file and the program.exe through which it was encrypted. When I want decrypt file, I need to know the password with which the file was encrypted. Can you help me some tool for brute-force attack to this password, which will be usable for .exe file? When I paste wrong password, I get a popup window displaying message: wrong password.
