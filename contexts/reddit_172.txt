I don't know what to do
I want to know if it is normal. I was an abused child from all sides and I lost my confidence in everything but at the same time I got tired of being alone ... I found a girl who is exactly like me ...  she is sweet and understanding.  I like her, I just don't feel those butterflies, that burning, you know, that feeling when you're in love ... I think it's because of my fear of giving someone confidence ... I don't know how I feel.  What to do?
