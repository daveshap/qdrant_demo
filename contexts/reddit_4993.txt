First my mother, tyen my best friend
My mother died in my arms this morning, and my best friend just took his own life. Why am I still here if no one wants me? Why am I still fucking here? It's clear that I'm not wanted or needed. What's the fucking point anymore? I swear I'm not gonna survive to the age of fucking 18, and I turn 18 in december. I just want out. I just want my mommyðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
