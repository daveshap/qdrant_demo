WOOLRIDGE: Karl, you up?
KARL: Yes sir.
WOOLRIDGE: Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
KARL: Yes sir.
WOOLRIDGE: Well, I guess we better hit the road.
BILL: Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
WOOLRIDGE: Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
BILL: Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did. Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
WOOLRIDGE: No, don't guess I do. Scooter, good to meet you. This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
BILL: I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
