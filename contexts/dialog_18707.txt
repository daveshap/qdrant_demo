SOFIE: I am irate!
MUMFORD: But...
SOFIE: But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
MUMFORD: I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
MUMFORD: But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
SOFIE: What?
MUMFORD: Will you think about it?
SOFIE: I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
MUMFORD: I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
SOFIE: Oh.
MUMFORD: I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
