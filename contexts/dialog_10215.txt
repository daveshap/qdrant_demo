SETH: You okay?
RICHARD: Yeah, I think so. What happened?
SETH: I don't know, you just passed out.
RICHARD: I did?
SETH: Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
RICHARD: Really?
SETH: Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
RICHARD: Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
SETH: Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
RICHARD: What?
SETH: We are... South of the border down Mexico way.""
RICHARD: We are?
SETH: Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
RICHARD: Far out. Where are my glasses?
SETH: They broke when you fell.
RICHARD: Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
SETH: Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
RICHARD: What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
SETH: When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
RICHARD: Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
SETH: It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
