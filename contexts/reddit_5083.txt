Seven internal interviews and am burnt out.
I work at a fortune 500 company and came in as an analyst. I felt I was ready to come in at a senior analyst level, but I thought since I was new to the industry (but not new to analytics) I would come in as an analyst and learn first before taking a leap to senior analyst. Now after a year and a quarter of experience and multiple good reviews, I started applying aggressively for a total of 6 senior analyst positions through out the company. It's a big company with many different departments so it is common for an employee to bounce around within.

Anyways, I've now done 5 interviews of which all 5 had case studies that required me to put in a full Saturday each to complete and have been rejected from 3 of them now. I have 2 more interviews scheduled and am thinking about pulling out now. There was a role that I really wanted and the hiring manager scheduled a follow up meeting with me just to reject me. That was wild. 

Does anybody have any experience with getting multiple interviews within the same company, but never landing a position? Why am I getting these interviews if they feel I'm not ready for the position?

TLDR: Applied to multiple internal, promotion positions and am getting the interviews, but not the job. Need advice on how to improve
