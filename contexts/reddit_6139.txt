Staying calm while on the phone for customer service in a new job?
Got a new job I’m really loving and doing well at. 

But, I do have to answer the phone and take orders for customers/track shipments/answer questions and I have a hard time doing work like this over the phone. I messed up an order today, and I feel guilty adding any stress to anyone’s day. I know I’m still new, but I would like to remain calm and not get anxious when I’m on the phone with our clients. The company has also been around 20+ years, so the clients know when you mess up pretty quickly. Any advice?
