CHRIS: Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
FATHER DYER: St. Mike's.
CHRIS: What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
FATHER DYER: Damien Karras.
CHRIS: Karras.
FATHER DYER: That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
