I need someone, anyone to talk to.
I’m in one of the darkest moments of my life and I don’t have anyone to turn to. I’d appreciate anyone to listen to what I have to say. I don’t know what I’m going to do.

Edit: I’m absolutely blown away with the support I’ve received from this post. I never thought it would get to much attention. Thank you to everyone who reached out, i feel like I can hold on another day now:)
