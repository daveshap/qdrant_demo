WOODLY: Safe and sound, I see. Oh--you came back.
HAROLD: I came back.
PENELOPE: You know each other?
WOODLY: We met here earlier this evening.
PENELOPE: How neat. How keen.
HAROLD: How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
WOODLY: A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
HAROLD: Tough luck. You'll have to split the fee.
WOODLY: Are--are you crying, Penelope?
HAROLD: She's crying because she's so happy.
PENELOPE: That's why I'm crying.
PAUL: Dr. Woodly? You know who this is?
WOODLY: I didn't get his name. A friend of your father?
PAUL: He isn't any friend of Father.
WOODLY: He isn't?
PAUL: He is my father.
WOODLY: No!
