PAUL: I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: As long as it is scotch. Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
PAUL: The United Nations are still here.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you. Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
PAUL: Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: What did you overhear?
PAUL: A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: What did they say?
PAUL: The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Watch everything? How? They are gone.
PAUL: Satellites.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: Satellites?
PAUL: Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: And what will they do with these satellites?
PAUL: The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: The high command? Our high command?
PAUL: 'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said. I thought I'd better tell you.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ‘we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.’ What do you think would have happened? No different.
PAUL: Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
PAUL: Where has all our beer gone?
ZOZO: Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
PAUL: How much beer?
ZOZO: Many beers.
PAUL: I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: The police are very busy.
PAUL: I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: He did.
PAUL: “Well rewarded” Those were his words.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
PAUL: The front gate would be best, General.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: I will see what I can do.
PAUL: I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
PAUL: I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
