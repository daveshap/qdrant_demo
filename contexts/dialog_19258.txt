CASE: I'm going in.
MOLLY: You're not ready yet. They said two days.
CASE: I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
MOLLY: If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
CASE: I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
MOLLY: What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
CASE: On a good run... yeah.
MOLLY: So you're a wire junkie.
CASE: When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
MOLLY: A regular Fagan.
CASE: Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
MOLLY: Too late?
CASE: Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
