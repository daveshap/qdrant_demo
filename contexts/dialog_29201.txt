CHARLIE: ...they say you're alright.
MAVERICK: I'm fine.
CHARLIE: This is it, then.
MAVERICK: What?
CHARLIE: The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
MAVERICK: He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
CHARLIE: That's not what I hear.
MAVERICK: I was flying...my responsibility.
CHARLIE: That's what you get flight pay for.
MAVERICK: Maybe I shouldn't take it.
CHARLIE: Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
MAVERICK: Not to me.
CHARLIE: You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.
MAVERICK: Where are we?
CHARLIE: Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
MAVERICK: You don't have to do this.
CHARLIE: Do what, show you a good time?
MAVERICK: I'm not good company. I should be alone.
CHARLIE: I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
MAVERICK: No.
CHARLIE: What do you want?
MAVERICK: I want it back.
CHARLIE: What?
MAVERICK: Yesterday.
CHARLIE: You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
MAVERICK: That's what I want.
CHARLIE: Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
