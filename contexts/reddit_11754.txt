Reasons to lose weight
Hi. I’m 5’11” and 210 lbs. I am considered overweight and near obese for my BMI. 

I’ve lost weight in the past. So I know what I need to do but right now the only motivator for me to lose weight is just to be spiteful to everyone who never wanted me at my current weight and I don’t want to live that angry anymore. It hurts and leaves me feeling empty inside.
