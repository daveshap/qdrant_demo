JUDY: How did you know that?
JUDY'S FATHER: We used to sing it in school. Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
JUDY: But the same song. I think it's fantastic!
JUDY'S FATHER: We were romantic then too--
JUDY: Are you and Mom home tonight?
JUDY'S FATHER: No. Why?
JUDY: Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
JUDY'S FATHER: With us old creeps? Come on, we have to eat.
JUDY: Daddy--
JUDY: Good evening.
JUDY'S FATHER: Hi.
JUDY: Didn't you forget something?
JUDY'S FATHER: What?
