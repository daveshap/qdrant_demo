ALDI legitimately changed our lives
No joke, we went from spending almost $300 at Walmart or Kroger every week for 2 adults and a toddler to $160 at Aldi. The produce is so much greener too, meat is always fresh. Seriously, cannot be overstated enough how amazing this place is by literally saving me like $7000+ a year.
