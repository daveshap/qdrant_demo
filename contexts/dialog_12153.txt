HAROLD: Cook, by God! Cook! You're the nigger now.
PENELOPE: People don't use that word any more.
HAROLD: Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice. I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me. Cook!
PENELOPE: You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
HAROLD: People now have dignity when frying eggs?
PENELOPE: They don't have to feel like slaves.
HAROLD: Then go now--and fry with dignity-- sunnyside up.
LOOSELEAF: I dunno, boy.
HAROLD: The educational process.
LOOSELEAF: I guess. You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
HAROLD: She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
HAROLD: What's funny about that?
LOOSELEAF: You know me, boy.
HAROLD: I should have torn that door off its hinges. Should have scrogged her ears off. Should have broken the bed. What do you want? Well?
PENELOPE: I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
HAROLD: I could eat a raw baby crocodile. The way to get your wife back is in bed. Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours. We're starving. Do you mind?
