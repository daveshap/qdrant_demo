MONICA: You asked me what was missing.
QUINCY: What?
MONICA: From basketball.
QUINCY: you woke me up to tell me that?
MONICA: It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
QUINCY: I heard enough.
MONICA: What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
QUINCY: We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
MONICA: I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
QUINCY: You haven't changed. You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass. Well, guess what, it doesn't.
MONICA: Then why are you so upset?
QUINCY: Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
MONICA: Better late than never, right?
QUINCY: Wrong.
MONICA: I'll play you.
QUINCY: What?
MONICA: One game. One-on-one.
QUINCY: For what?
MONICA: Your heart.
QUINCY: You're out of your mind.
MONICA: So you're gonna bitch up?
QUINCY: What's that supposed to be, psychology?
MONICA: I know why you broke up with me in college. And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too. So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
QUINCY: Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay. I mean, I was lost. So you are forgiven. But that was five years ago. I moved on.
