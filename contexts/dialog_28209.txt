MAN: That's too easy. One minute you want to die, the next you want to live... Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
JEANNE: No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
MAN: Oh? And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
JEANNE: I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
MAN: Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace? You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
JEANNE: I don't understand. What do you want from me?
MAN: I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
