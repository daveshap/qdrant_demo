JIMMY: Okay, peaches, okay. But can I ask you one thing?
LOUISE: Maybe.
JIMMY: Does it have something to do with another guy? Are you in love with him?
LOUISE: It's nothin' like that.
JIMMY: Then what?! What, goddamnit, Louise! Where the fuck are you going? Are you just leaving for fucking ever? What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!
LOUISE: Stop it! Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now. I'm not kiddin'!
JIMMY: Alright, alright. I'm sorry.
JIMMY: Can I just ask you one other thing?
LOUISE: Maybe.
