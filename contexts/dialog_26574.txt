MACKELWAY: I've been to Chicago.
MURMAN: [Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
MACKELWAY: If I owe, I will go.
MURMAN: [The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
MACKELWAY: Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
MURMAN: [Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
