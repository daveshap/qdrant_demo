Install an older kernel 14.04 LTS I'm lost.  I cannot find the answer I need anywhere.  I updated to 4.4.0-81 and ever since doing so I cannot access many of my installed software.  Nothing happens.  No errors coming up.  I would like to get back to 4.4.0-77 which worked fine.  I made the mistake of purging the functional kernel before testing.  I cannot figure out how to roll-back.My system was stable as can be with the older Kernel.  How can I go back?linux-headers-4.4.0-81                                           4.4.0-81.104~14.04.1                                      all          Header files related to Linux kernel version 4.4.0ii  linux-headers-4.4.0-81-generic                                   4.4.0-81.104~14.04.1                                      amd64        Linux kernel headers for version 4.4.0 on 64 bit x86 SMPii  linux-headers-generic-lts-xenial                                 4.4.0.81.66
