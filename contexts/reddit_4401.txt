I’m 16 with responsibilities of a 30 year old..
So i moved away from my mom last year to live with my dad. he was crazy so i wanted to move back with my mom. he ended up calling the police on me for ‘running away’ and my stepdad decided that because of that i couldn’t come live with my mom again. so i am living with my boyfriend in a trailer that my grandma owns in a completely different town from any of my family. i have no adults helping me with food, gas, anything. i hate it so much and it is so hard to function because i am not able to have any fun with any friends because i have too many things to do, such as cleaning the house every day while my boyfriend just trashed it. i am overwhelmed and think about just ending it all a lot.
