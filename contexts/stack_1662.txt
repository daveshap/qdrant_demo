Relay arcing protection for analog input I need to measure the voltage of a Li-ion battery that is connected through a relay, on the NC pin, to the rest of the circuit (so BAT+ -  relay  -     circuit). The coil of the relay is connected to a usb 5v port used for charging the battery. Basically when charging, the battery is disconnected from the circuit (relay open).The analog pin of the arduino is connected downstream of the relay. I know that a mechanical relay arc when opening and closing the contacts. Relay: 5VDC, 3A, SPDTMax current through contacts at opening: 2.5AUnknown value for voltage spikes when arcing; i would assume max 50-100vDo i need to worry about arcing affecting the analog pin on the arduino (both when opening and closing the contacts)? Do those voltage spikes also carry high current? If so, would a RC in parallel to the relay contacts be enough?Do i need a voltage divider on the analog pin? What would be the resistors values?Would a 5v 700mA TVS diode between analog input and ground be better?Sorry for asking dumb questions, i am new to electronics.Thank you
