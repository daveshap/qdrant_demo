BOB: Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies. You rate right up there. We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
HEATHER: What?
BOB: I know. We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked. Look, how about we get in touch your agent. You still with Jerry?
HEATHER: Yes, but...
BOB: We'll work something out. I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
HEATHER: Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
BOB: I don't know. A couple months. Why?
HEATHER: And since you've been thinking of making it. Has anything funny happened?
BOB: I don't follow.
HEATHER: Like weird calls, by any chance?
