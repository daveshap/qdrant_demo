CHARLIE: Let's get out of here.
JOHNNY BOY: Did you see them run!
JOHNNY BOY: I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work. I swear it.
CHARLIE: That's not going to help.
JOHNNY BOY: I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
CHARLIE: It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
JOHNNY BOY: I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
CHARLIE: Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
JOHNNY BOY: Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
CHARLIE: How?
JOHNNY BOY: If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
CHARLIE: That'll help you out fine. That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this. You understand? I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out.
CHARLIE: I don't get involved with anything, you understand that? Nothing! I'm clean as far as you know...right?
JOHNNY BOY: Yeah, take it easy. Will you relax.
CHARLIE: That's what I get for getting involved. Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok? This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him. If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand? I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
JOHNNY BOY: I understand.
