What do you do in your down time?
Aside from scrolling through Reddit, I find it's super difficult to keep busy at work. I really try to stay busy but there's only so much I can do. I'm new to this job (it's a role in business) and I'm in a bit of a "training" phase. The person I am to replace isn't leaving for another 1-4 months and my boss admitted he barely has anything for me to do. 

What are some things you like to do when/if you have free time at work to better your skills?
