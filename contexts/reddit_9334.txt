Having an emergency fund is a secret super power.
Disclaimer: Not gonna beg for money. I'm fine physically.  
However, I just got in a car wreck this morning and now I'm walking into a dealership with an envelope containing $6,000.  
That $25-$50/paycheck is worth every penny.

Edit:  
I know I would get a better deal from a private party sale. I just never bought a car from a dealer before so I figured I'd see what it was like. I didn't buy anything.  
Instead I bought a 2004 Chevy 2500 diesel to replace the truck I wrecked. I picked this guy up for $4k title in hand just registered it and transferred my plates. Now just waiting on then insurance check to come in to refund my emergency fund.
