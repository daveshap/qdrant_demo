Company is paying for training/accommodation in another state, what are hotel stays like? Do you usually get a single room or stay with another person?
I'm pretty new to the working work and have no clue how this would work. I suppose it's company dependent whether or not it's a single room or a room with two beds for two people but I'd like to know if it's more common to expect one or the other.
