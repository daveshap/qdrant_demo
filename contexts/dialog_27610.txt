ADELE: I think it's worse now.
LARDNER: That always used to work.
ADELE: Yeah, well it's not everyday you get news like this. You're sure he's okay? Other than the bump on the head?
LARDNER: Well...
ADELE: Dad...
LARDNER: He doesn't remember anything, Delly. Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
ADELE: ... including me. Right?
LARDNER: I'm afraid not. He looked right at your picture without batting an eye. But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him. It just takes a catalyst.
ADELE: You mean, me?
LARDNER: It's possible.
