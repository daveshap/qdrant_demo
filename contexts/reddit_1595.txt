My interviewer invited me to his house...and I said yes.
It was after the interview, invited me over for dinner since it turned out he lives 3 doors down from me. He was literally the most wholesome guy ever. His wife had prepared mashed potatoes, beans, and a whole roast leg of lamb which I ate with him, his wife, and their two middle school age sons. Ended up playing smash ultimate with his sons for 2 hours before walking home. 

I guess you could say my Yale interview went well. Sucks my essays were dogshit
