What security vulnerabilities are there with IDENTITY_INSERT and DBCC CHECKIDENT I'm writing some simple C# code through a website to take an excel file and update a table on a database. My system admin seems to not want to give me access to pretty much anything including the two things above stating that I need a Security+ certificate in order to run those commands.I've been doing this a long time (15 years), first I've ever run into a problem like this, and so this seems really really weird and strange.I already can update, insert, delete and do modifications to tables as I have been given some access to the database. So what if any are the security implications of these additional permissions? Can someone explain the reluctance of the SA to grant me these permission? Please enlighten me, because at this point I'm just scratching my head trying to figure out why the application cannot be granted these rights.
