SICK BOY: Did you tell him?
BEGBIE: No. On you go.
RENTON: What?
SICK BOY: There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
RENTON: How much?
SICK BOY: About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
RENTON: So?
SICK BOY: So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
RENTON: So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?
