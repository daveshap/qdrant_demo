SZPILMAN: Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
MAJOREK: It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
SZPILMAN: I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends. I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
