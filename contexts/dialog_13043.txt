JERRY: Keep straight on this road here.
BILL: How much further?
JERRY: I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
BILL: I don't know.
MARY: Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
DENISE: Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
JERRY: Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
BILL: What's that?
JERRY: It's a hitchhiker.
BILL: Way out here?
MARY: Well, don't even think about playing the good samaritan, there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
BILL: It's a girl.
JERRY: Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
DENISE: That seems likely.
MARY: Should we stop?
BILL: We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
MARY: She looks like a freak.
DENISE: Stick her in the front, if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
MARY: She looks like she stinks.
BILL: She looks like she stinks.
JERRY: Cat fight, cat fight.
