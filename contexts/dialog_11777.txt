ANNIE: Let's bring your bags inside.
GRACE: Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
ANNIE: Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
DIANE: Well, I am going to go after lunch.
ANNIE: No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
ROBERT: I can't believe it's the same horse.
TOM: We still have a way to go.
ROBERT: How much longer do you think?
TOM: Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
ROBERT: I understand...
FRANK: We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
TOM: He thought it was a ghost.
