Got rejected from every college and just signed full-time job offer!
I was rejected from every schools that I applied to last month.. and i just became a full-time software engineer at the company I’ve been interning at since last year!
I got reallly high salary for my age and experience(higher than entry software engineer at top tech companies like samsung in my country). 

Just know that you don’t always need college to advance in life. Your grit will advance you by itself.

I want to say, do ECs that really excite you and you like doing. That four years of highschools isnt nothing. If you use it to develop yourself, it’s the perfect opportunity to pursue you interest while you are not expected to. Thats four years of experience that you may get ahead of others
