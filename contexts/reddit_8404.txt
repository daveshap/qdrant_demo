What are the benefits or drawbacks of India repealing Article 370 with respect to Kashmir?
India has revoked Article 370, removing a number of special privileges that Kashmir has enjoyed as part of India. How will this repeal affect Kashmir and its people? A focus on short-term versus long-term impacts would be strongly appreciated.

>The Indian government said on Monday that it was revoking a constitutional provision that had for decades given a unique degree of autonomy to Kashmir, a disputed mountainous region along the India-Pakistan border.

>For many years, Kashmir has been governed differently than other parts of India, and the government’s decision to revoke parts of Article 370 of the Constitution is widely seen as a blow to Kashmir’s special status. India’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, known as the B.J.P., has deep roots in a Hindu nationalist ideology and one of its campaign promises during the election this year had been removing the special status of Kashmir, which is predominantly Muslim.
