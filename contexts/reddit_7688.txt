New job Iwant requires Master's - I'm one semester from an MA- should I apply anyway?
Hi everyone
This firm I want to work for has a position opening that I want. It requires "at least a Master's degree" - I plan to graduate in Dec 2019 and have good experience, I think.

Tricky part is, the place I work now consults with them often. I worry if I apply and don't get the position my wanting to move on from my current employer will become known. (I imagine this is already assumed by most at my work though since I am in a low level position AND going to grad school)

Should I wait for my MA and then look for work or try anway? I'm also concerned I won't get paid at an MA level if I apply now.

Any advice appreciated!
