RATZ: I saw your girl yesterday.
CASE: I don't have a girl.
RATZ: No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
RATZ: Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
CASE: You're pleasant tonight.
RATZ: Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
CASE: Yeah.
LINDA LEE: Hello, Case.
CASE: I thought you already left.
LINDA LEE: Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
CASE: Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
LINDA LEE: People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
CASE: I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
LINDA LEE: This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
CASE: Where did you here that?
LINDA LEE: Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case. I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
