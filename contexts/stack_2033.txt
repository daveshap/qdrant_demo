Usage \"when he grows up\" In the following sentence is it correct to use the present tense (\"when he grows up\") with a story that is basically told in the past tense?<blockquote>  Don dreamed of becoming a doctor one day, when he grows up.</blockquote>Can \"dreamed\" (in the past) go with (\"when he grows up\") in the future?I don't think that \"grew up\" can fit, but \"grows up\" sounds a bit awkward as well.Tnx, Tommy
