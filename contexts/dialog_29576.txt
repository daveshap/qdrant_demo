VAL: But...we could pull something! We could, I don't know, drag a car behind it!
EARL: A car, huh? Like a big armored car? Need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
VAL: Its tires are flat...
EARL: Doesn't matter. The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
VAL: Well...all <u>right</u>! We just roll on out of here!
EARL: We got a plan!
RHONDA: Listen, they only respond to vibration, right? Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
VAL: Yeah, good! Something to keep them busy. We need a decoy.
