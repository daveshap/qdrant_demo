When someone doesn’t put in effort to keep a convo going by using “lols” or “😂😂😂” or “lmao”. Then just stop wasting my time.
It truly annoys me to see someone constantly being lazy with trying to keep a convo going by using “lol” or “😂😂😂” as a answer to what you said even though it wasn’t even funny but they just don’t care about keeping the convo going and you’re just another person in they’re contact list. It’s truly the most annoying thing in the world like actually talk to me and keep the convo going if you don’t want to talk so be it but stop wasting my time.
