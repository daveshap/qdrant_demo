LIZA: Where'd you get it?
JONAS: You do recognize it then?
LIZA: It was my father's. Kept it in his wallet. He was murdered --
JONAS: I know the story. A federal judge. He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
LIZA: Not a man. Ezekiel Walters.
JONAS: Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
LIZA: You sound so sure.
