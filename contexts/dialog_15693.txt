CLARICE: What'd I do?
ARDELIA: Stay cool. Just remember to call him God.""
CRAWFORD: Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
CLARICE: Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
CRAWFORD: Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
CLARICE: I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
CRAWFORD: A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.
CRAWFORD: We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
CLARICE: Not yet.
CRAWFORD: You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
CLARICE: Who's the subject?
CRAWFORD: The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
