MR. JOHNSON: There aren't any cheeseburgers.
DAVID: What?
MR. JOHNSON: Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
DAVID: Listen to me!
DAVID: Do you have the lettuce?
MR. JOHNSON: ... Yeah.
DAVID: Have you cooked the burgers?
MR. JOHNSON: Yes.
DAVID: Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
