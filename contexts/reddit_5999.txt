Studying Master while working full-time on the same field
I have 4 years experience on Business Intelligence, a sector which nowadays is in constant growth, and I receive job offers almost daily.

Now, I'm afraid of facing a future where this sector has fallen down, and keeping a job gets much harder. I'm afraid that in this situation, I won't be able to compete with fellow workmates which aside of the job experience, have a Master in the same field.

Some people have recommended me a Master in Business Intelligence and Big Data which could be interesting for my formation, but its expensive (affordable, but expensive) and will demand me to invest 20 hours weekly aside of my 40 hours per week job.  
I don't want to "*ruin*" the next two years of my life in a 60 hours routine just to have a paper, but if it really makes the difference in the future I can make the effort.

Do you have any thoughts/experiences about this topic?

Thank you very much in advance!
