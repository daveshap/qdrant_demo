BYRON: This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
ZACK: Great.
BYRON: I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
ZACK: I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
BYRON: You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
ZACK: I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
