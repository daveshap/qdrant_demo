NICKY: Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
GAGGI: Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan? Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
ACE: Well, that's why they paid so well.
GAGGI: You see? Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?

ACE: I'll come by.
GAGGI: Seven o'clock?
ACE: Seven o'clock.
