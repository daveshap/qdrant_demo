Has anyone ever been turned down by a company then ended up working for them down the road?
I don't mean like a big company where you applied years later and got hired. I mean a smaller one where you met the team and they gave you that whole bullshit about keeping your resume on file for future consideration.

So I have to ask... has this ever worked out? And ESPECIALLY has it ever worked out where they reached out to you first?
