WES: You get it yet?
JAEGER: Naw, nothing.
WES: You will. You'll get it.
JAEGER: I'll show Epps. He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
WES: You really think there's a treasure inside?
JAEGER: I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here. I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
WES: Jaeger?
JAEGER: What?
WES: You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
JAEGER: Yeah. So?
WES: That's in two days.
JAEGER: Like I said; so?
WES: They're cancelling all leaves, all passes. No more drills. We stand at full ready starting--
JAEGER: What's your point, Wes? You have a point?
WES: We're going to war, aren't we. If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
JAEGER: It doesn't mean anything.
WES: Why would they do all that if we weren't?
