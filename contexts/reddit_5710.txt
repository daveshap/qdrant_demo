Getting hired after long term unemployment
I been unemployed the past 3 years and Im having struggle with getting hired. I had an few interviews but no luck. I live in an small area and Im currently battling depression. Last job I had was in retail, parents split at the time and I couldn't handle working plus going to high school. Im not sure what to do here, I am planning on starting online college to major in psychology to become therapist but I need to buy an laptop. Need some tips on how to get hired, Im doing everything right during the interview but I think my work history is the problem.
