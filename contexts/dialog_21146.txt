BETTY: I think you're drunk.
MITCHELL: Just drunk enough.
MITCHELL: What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
BETTY: Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell... ..don't. I'm warning you.
BRANDON: Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
MITCHELL: Did I do something wrong?
BRANDON: I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
MITCHELL: How would you know, Brandon?
BRANDON: Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
MITCHELL: You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
BRANDON: Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
