You're not wasting your time.
With early decisions coming out soon, the stress level on this sub has spiked. People post stuff like this:

>We all try so hard here for that 1600, 4.0, EC, jobs, etc for college and many of us...will go to a state school like everyone else who didn't try. We'll have everything we did for nothing. I feel like if I get rejected from T20s, I've accomplished nothing. My time has been wasted and I would have been in the same school if I had done nothing.

That got upvoted to hot. I'm not trying to call out OP, just point out that the sentiment is alive and well on this sub.

But it shouldn't be. **You might go to the same school as your less driven peers, but you'll come in with better opportunities and better skills.**

# Scholarships

Thinking plainly, if you're going to your state school but you're competitive for T20s, you'll get substantial scholarships. That's going to offset the cost of your education a lot, and there's a chance you could graduate debt-free, or close to it.

You might not fully appreciate that now, but I guarantee you will at 35, when all of your debt-ridden classmates are still paying 20% of their income to offset student loans. And if you do decide to go to grad school, you won't have to worry about the loans you took out for your undergrad.

# Honors Programs

Any state school is going to have a good honors college, which you'll be a member of. Here are just a few of the perks:

* **Priority registration for all of your classes.** This is a lifesaver at the bigger schools, where kids freak out the second registration opens and rush to get a spot in their preferred class (and usually don't get it). You'll never have to worry about your long-term graduation plan being thrown off because you couldn't sign up for a class on time, or have to settle for a class with a professor you don't like. You get first pick.
* **Priority and/or special housing.** Lots of colleges give honors kids the first pick of dorms, or they have the choice of living in honors housing. And with the wide range of housing at most state schools, from *built in the 1910s and falling apart* to *modern tech paradise built 2 years ago*, you'll be extremely grateful. Plus, honors housing builds a community for you and lets you find academically minded peers.
* **Specialized advising and mentoring.** Going to a big state school, or even a T20, means you'll probably see your advisor a few times a year, usually just to schedule classes. With honors programs, you have a counselor dedicated to you, and you can meet with them regularly. Obviously this is super helpful when you're looking for opportunities like internships or summer programs. Plus, you'll get connected to a mentor in your field of interest, and growing that relationship will give you access to a lot of amazing programs you won't have known about otherwise.
* **Honors classes/seminars.** Not a thing at all schools, but some state schools let you take a few Honors-only classes, which tend to be much more discussion-based. They're also capped at a much smaller number of students, so your learning is much more personalized.

# Advanced Standing Opportunities

You know all those AP/IB/dual credit classes you're taking? Remember how the whole point is to get you college credit? It actually transfers at state schools, unlike most T20s. You can build a much more personalized schedule, from graduating early, double-majoring, skipping weed-outs, or just enjoying your classes more than if you were forced to take "Intro to Physics" as an English major.

For me, my AP classes clear away all but 6 credit hours of a 32 credit hour gen-ed requirement at my state school. I could graduate a year early, but because my scholarships are so nice, I'd probably take 4 years and leave with a major, related minor, and 3 school-year internships in my desired field. I wouldn't have that much course flexibility if I went to a T20, and it's honestly a big reason why I'm considering staying in-state.

# Resume and College ECs

No matter what, the tangible stuff disappears once you reach college--you won't be MUN President or LD State Champion--but the lessons you learn from your ECs don't. You're going to enter college with better time management and organization, better soft skills, and better understandings of what it takes to run an organization like a club.

That stuff can stay on your resume until you build up college honors. If it's freshman year and you're trying to get an internship in your field, you'll have the EC experience that shows you understand what you're doing. When you're competing with other underclassmen, or even some juniors, internships/competitions/leadership shows that you know what's going on.

That experience also makes it easier for you to dive into campus extracurriculars so you can build up your resume and keep doing the things you loved to do in high school. At your state school, you'll be a big fish. You'll be able to take up leadership more quickly and be a star within the clubs. You'll get to be fully immersed in what you're doing as extracurriculars, not just a minor role like you might be at T20s.

# You've put yourself on a track for success no matter where you go. State schools will throw opportunities at you, and not everyone gets that opportunity. Don't forget that.
