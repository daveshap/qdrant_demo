BEYNON: A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
DOC: I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
BEYNON: What do you add up to here?
DOC: One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
BEYNON: A little more was taken out before. My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
DOC: So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
BEYNON: The obvious. But we are both not interested in that right now.
DOC: No. My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
BEYNON: Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
DOC: I bet.
