My girlfriend is cheating on me (She 100% IS NOT cheating on me)
Hello,

Some background: I'm 24 and and in my first relationship (ever) with a girl I've reconnected with from high school. We've only been dating for around 7 months but it's a serious relationship, we both say we love each other. 

I want to spend every minute free I have with her, I want to be with her forever and I love her with all my heart, and as far as I can tell, she wants basically the same thing. I think I'm a bit more into her than she is into me but I may just be overthinking it. 

ANYWAYS, I have a problem. I constantly feel like she's either cheating on me, or talking to other people behind my back, or just not that into me at all. I'm always worried like she's going to break up or cheat on me or that she already has.

Of course she is not cheating on me, she is so sincere and kind and I know she really likes me, but I just can't shake this pervasive feeling of being jealous and untrusting of her. Is this normal for a relationship? I haven't told her that I feel this way obviously and I certainly don't control her, she is free to do/talk to whatever she likes. I really want to not be like this, whenever we're together we go hand in hand but when we're apart it physically pains me (I feel SUPER anxious) that I'm not with her in addition to the fact that I feel extremely jealous. What can I do to make myself feel better?

Thank you for reading, I love this subreddit everyone here is so kind and caring. You're all easily one of the best subreddits.
