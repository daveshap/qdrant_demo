IS Student Affairs the right path for someone interested in Development?
I am trying to figure out whether Student Affairs would be the optimal course of study for me. I have a background in non-profit outreach (including a term with AmeriCorps) and currently work in sales at a startup. 

My dream job would be as a director of development at a college or run the civic engagement/community volunteering office.

 I really like the hands-on experiential aspect of a student affairs masters, as well as the funding that comes with it, but I am wondering if my interests are better suited to an MPA program.

Is it plausible I could have both these potential career paths open to me if I do a Student Affairs masters?
