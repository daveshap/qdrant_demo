EDWARD: I want to.
STUCKEY: Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
EDWARD: I'll see him alone. Everyone knows you're my muscle. We'll make it social. Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner. Tonight if you can arrange it.
STUCKEY: You shouldn't go alone. He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
EDWARD: Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia. I'll see you in the office. By the way, about your car...
STUCKEY: Oh, god, what?
EDWARD: I'll bring it back.
EDWARD: Good morning.
VIVIAN: You didn't wake me. I'll be out of here in a minute.
EDWARD: No hurry. Would you like some breakfast?
