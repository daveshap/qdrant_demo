This subreddit should be called debt free congratulate me, not poverty finance. So sick of it, finally unsubscribed.
Actual legitimate questions or tips? A few upvotes. "Finally paid off x?" Hundreds or thousands. This is not what I signed up for.

Edit: comments have since suggested r/helpmeimpoor for actionable advice and r/debtfree for more bragging posts.

Edit again: I have received several comments implying that the reason I'm upset is because I am in debt, which is a fair assumption tbh, but I am actually not in debt, just frustrated with the repetitiveness.
