MARY: Jabez -- help!
JABEZ: Coming.
JABEZ: Down, Shep! Down!
MARY: He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
JABEZ: All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
MARY: You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
MA STONE: Mary -- Jabez --
MARY: Coming, Ma.
JABEZ: What is that smile on your face? Is there anything wrong with me?
MARY: Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
JABEZ: You're right, Mary.
