MALKOVICH: Come on in.
MAXINE: I can explain about the portal, darling.
MALKOVICH: Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
MAXINE: Oh shut up. Craig, darling are you in there?
MALKOVICH: Yes. How did you know it was me?
MAXINE: Lotte called me.
MALKOVICH: Oh, so the bitch escaped.
MAXINE: Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
MALKOVICH: I'm getting better all the time.
MAXINE: I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
MALKOVICH: No... damn... you... Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
LESTER: You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
LOTTE: Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
LESTER: Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
LOTTE: No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
LESTER: What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
LOTTE: No, I didn't know that.
LESTER: Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
LOTTE: No.
LESTER: Oh, sorry. Right this way.
