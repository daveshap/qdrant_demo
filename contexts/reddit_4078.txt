On a date, what do you think if a guy asks to kiss you?
I (27F)  went on a couple of dates with a guy I met online (30M). I'm really shy and not good with pda at the beginning of dating. In the past, all guys have kind of wanted to rush into pda and kissing.

We hadn't held hands or anything like that but got on really well. At the end of the date, he asked if he could kiss me. I liked him so went for it :p but did wonder.

I'm just curious to know what kind of guy asks, or if this is how things should be...or of he's actually shy as well? Or ladies, how would you react if asked the question?
