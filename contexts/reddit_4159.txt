I think I'm dead on the inside.
The current dating culture has made me super jaded.

1.) I'm not excited to go on dates anymore. It's the same thing over and over again. Getting to know someone...where they went to school, etc. I have to care, but deep down, I really don't. This person I'm getting to know can drop me in an instant...maybe even after this date and this effort will be wasted...again.

2.) Most of the girls I meet have some kind of trauma from their ex or something. Then I have debate if I want to continue or not.

3.) Related to 2, I don't feel all that bad about dropping a girl anymore. I send a politically correct message and try to be friends after. They mostly never want to talk to me again. Where is my friend zone? I don't mind making friends.

4.) I don't wait for/am not excited for a girl's response to my text anymore. If it never comes, I just assume she ghosted me. If she had in fact been hit by a car or something, I sure would never followup...so I'd never know. I don't even feel bad when a girl ghosts me anymore. It's business as usual. 

5.) If I ask a girl out and I'm rejected...I feel nothing. I don't even try to plead my case. She said no? Ok. Move along.

6.) I'm old. I used to worry about not being able to have kids, being alone for the rest of my life, etc. I just don't care about that anymore. I'd rather be lonely than be stuck in a bad relationship.

7.) I'm lonely as hell sometimes, but I'm super calm about it. I don't feel the need to go to bars, etc. to try to meet girls all the time. I'm fine with a Friday night just sitting there by myself watching Netflix or Youtube. If I have an itch one day, I'll go mess around and have fun, but if not? Lazy day it is.

So...am I dead on the inside? Sure seems like it. LOL.
