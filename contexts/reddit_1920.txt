School shaming can really hurt people, so why do it?
I saw a post to a similar effect last week; I hope this is meaningful and to the point.

School shaming, whether it be an earnest chuckle or snide remark about ranking, will NEVER make someone feel nice inside. Whether the intentions be in good spirit or malicious, the only outcome is tainting what should be the happy memory of a fellow senior. Getting accepted to school, from a dream college to a safety, might be the best moment of someone’s HS career; why would you taint this memory by casting doubt and embarrassment over a peer? 

In closing, I have a small bit of advice that, while applicable to many situations, is especially relevant during this time: before commenting on a university a peer or stranger was accepted to, think of how it may impact the person in question and whether or not it would smear what should be a happy memory. Don’t be the person who creates embarrassment and sadness; support your friends and redditers *even* if you dislike the school they were accepted to! 

Many people will not tell you that your comments upset them; we all need to keep this in mind.
