Idk if my friends are genuinely real
First of all i am a (15yo male) So this doubt all started at the day of my bday so i usally didn't celebrate bdays cause i just didn't see the point but my friends on the other hand love celebrating their bdays so i surprised my "bff"?for his bday paid for most of the decorations cake balloons candles gifts and after the party we went out to a big mall that we used to work at and just hung out but when it was close to my bday i invited all of them to my house my bff had a family trip to Turkey and he didnt even tell me my other friends just couldnt come i was devastated cause i surprised my best friend and did a lot of stuff for the others but they still didnt come i live in tehran.iran rn i used to live in isf and i usually work so i can get some money to go to isf and pay for my own shit and sleep at my uncle's house but i hang out with friends all the time but when my friends come here they don't even think of coming to my house they say they dont have the liberty that i do and that is true but there is a slight difference between my liberty and theirs idk do i have real friends i used to have a lot of friends but i had to choose between them and my best friends and i chose my best friends but I think that was the wrong decision
