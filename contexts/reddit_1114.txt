After not leaving the house in 4 years..
I can’t stop smiling right now! In June it will be 4 years since I left my house and today I went to the Home Depot and made a purchase!!!! Walking to the car to leave felt like I was walking into a war zone! It’s not far from my house but there is a couple traffic lights that scare the shit out of me, not to mention it’s the freakin Home Depot on a Saturday morning😬😬😬😬.  It was not easy and I thought I was gonna loose it a few times (and almost did) but I somehow kept it together. I am just so proud of myself right now and needed somewhere to say it!  There is hope out there🙏🏻.

Edit:  WOW, silver and gold!, thank you all so much, I can’t tell you how happy I am from all the support. I am literally having the best day!!!!!
