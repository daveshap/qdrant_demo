Should I spend nearly $5k to obtain certifications in an industry I am not yet in, but want to get into?
So with my job, I am in a unique position.  I have a few years experience in a regulatory entity, with over a year specific to financial services regulation and policymaking.  About a year ago, dismayed by my current salary and future salary potential at my employer, began looking for other jobs on the side.  My role is most akin to a compliance role in a financial services firm, and out of all the applications I have sent out over the year, I have gotten the furthest with bank compliance roles.  This would be great, as my salary would increase by 50-100%, I would receive better benefits (employer pays towards student debt and future tuition, etc) and the role would honestly probably be easier and more streamlined compared to what I do now.  I know for sure I can do the role and many of my skills and experience match up.  

Notice how I said "have gotten the furthest with" as I haven't been able to seal the deal as of yet.  I will provide three brief examples of this.  With my first opportunity, I got past the screening and made it to the interview, but was ultimately passed for another individual.  This was at a mid-sized credit union with a lot of exposure in my state.  My second opportunity I passed on, because the job would've required a move to another state and I was unsure if I wanted to make the move into compliance or instead explore other options.  I passed the screening and was invited for the interview, but ultimately passed on it.  This was at a well known investment bank, as well.

I am currently going through my third opportunity for a manager role at a regional community bank; I was initially surprised that they got back to me, as they scheduled a video screening the day after I submitted my application, and I don't have actual compliance experience.  The next day they asked for a remote video meeting with the head of the department, as the job is about 2 hours away.  The interview went well, but right off the bat the head explained they had a more compliance experienced person in mind, but wanted to learn more about my role because what I do is extremely similar.  That was yesterday, and while it went well, this position was a long shot in my mind and I am surprised I made it this far.  I even explained that I would be willing to obtain certifications ***before*** starting to assuage any anxieties over my exposure to the actual duties and responsibilities.

I am starting to realize that my resume and cover letter intrigue employers which gets me in the door, my experience in a familiar role gets me past the screening, but the fact that what I do is similar but not exactly what the role requires is made apparent during the interview.

At this point, making the move into this industry seems to be my best option, and I can actually provide insight into strategies and improve operations.  I am considering going full steam ahead into getting industry specific compliance certification(s) so there is concrete evidence that I would know what I am doing.  I would be more qualified and feel more comfortable applying for "Senior Analyst" or "Manager" roles. 

The issue is that, each certification can cost $1,500 - $2,965, which is a considerable amount of money to me out of pocket.  I can't apply traditional student loans for these industry certifications either, so I would either need a private education loan, max out credit cards, save up over the next few months, or get a loan from family.  

Given the fact that these employers are already taking me seriously with my current qualifications, is it advisable to pay out of pocket or take a small loan to cover the costs for an industry certification(s)?  At the moment I am looking at three options:

1. Obtain a more specific certification from a smaller professional association which would only count towards continuing education credits, not a designation ($1,500)
2. Obtain two certifications, both of which come from the most recognized professional association in the industry, and count towards the most well recognized designation ($4,790 for both)
3. Obtain only one of the aforementioned certifications from (2), which would still count towards the designation but not as much as both combined. ($2,095-$2,695 depending on which one) 

It's also important to note that, I could finish any 1 or 2 of these certifications within two weeks because I am already familiar with the subject matter, but less so implementation of strategy.  Further, I am holding off on pursuing a certification until I hear back from my current manager opportunity, because they could either provide them for free or give me the industry discount.  

Does anyone have experience obtaining industry specific certifications ***before*** entering said industry?
