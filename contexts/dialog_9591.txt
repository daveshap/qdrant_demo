CLEAR: What did you see? What am I looking for?
KIMBERLY: No, it's not here. This one was different. More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
CLEAR: Another premonition?
KIMBERLY: Yes. I was in a hospital. There was screaming... A nurse was choking me. I couldn't tell what she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face. Kalarjian.
THOMAS: Kalarjian?
KIMBERLY: I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
