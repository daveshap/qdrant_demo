Welp, I just lost my job
I was essential until today. I'm a millennial. I was in fertility treatments because it took me until 35 to be close to getting there. Unexplained infertility. My health insurance ends in 7 days. That train has sailed now. I'm sad. I'm over it,  I'm done. Both my husband and I have masters degrees. We have zero income now and a shitton of debt and will be applying for unemployment, food stamps, and ACA tomorrow.

How do you work so hard, your whole ass off and it's over in what's a text from your boss "hey, do you have a quick second for a conversation?"

I'm ready to give up. I didn't last time, but this time feels real.

EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your kind words. I really appreciate it and absolutely appreciate the time that you all took to share your stories and offer your support. 

For those that asked- My master's is in Aviation and I worked as an operations manager and my husband's is in art and he worked as an exhibit designer for a museum which has closed due to the pandemic. I have a lot of training and professional development experience, so I'm looking to maybe pivot into something more like that.
