HILDY: How was that for a tight squeeze?
BURNS: Don't tell me you were worried!
HILDY: Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
BURNS: Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
HILDY: In a way.
BURNS: I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
HILDY: We've certainly been in some swell jams.
BURNS: Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
HILDY: Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
BURNS: Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
HILDY: We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
BURNS: In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
HILDY: Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
BURNS: Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
HILDY: That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
BURNS: Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
HILDY: Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
BURNS: Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
HILDY: Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
BURNS: He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
HILDY: I don't know what to do, Walter.
BURNS: Flip a coin.
HILDY: All right. Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
