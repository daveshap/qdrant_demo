Not a single person actually cares unless you kill yourself
If you say you're so depressed you can't function it's "Aw it'll get better" and they forget about you. Then when you kill yourself everyone's like "Oh I never would've thought, I wish he would've given some sort of sign."


I said how many times I want to kill myself and I think I might do it, but I know if I do people will act like it's a huge surprise.


I've been serious all along. I have a rope tied into a noose in a box in my room, so that it's always ready. I'm not joking or just looking for attention when I tell people I need some kind of help. Everybody only pretends to care and then when you're dead tries to say they cared all along
