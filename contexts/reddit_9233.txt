I turned down a job that would have started at $17 an hour
Which would have seemed insane to me 2 years ago but it feels so good to be in a position that I can actually turn down jobs that seemed unreal to me before.

My current job pays $15 an hour plus I average 4 hours of overtime each week, so after doing the math I realized I would actually be taking a slight pay cut if I took the new job working a straight 40 hours a week. Factor in that I would be driving more than twice as much plus an unpaid lunch vs getting a paid lunch now and I'm actually better off where I'm at.

Just over 2 years ago I was working for minimum wage, 6 months ago I was unemployed completely after getting laid off and borderline suicidal. I stopped smoking weed so I could get my current job, which was really hard for me but proving to be worth it. I guess I'm posting this just to say that things can always get better when they seem the worst and to not give up hope even when things seem hopeless like I almost did.
