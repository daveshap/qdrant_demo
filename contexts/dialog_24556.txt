JERRY: I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
SUGAR: You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
JERRY: No - no lights. We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
SUGAR: I may spill something.
JERRY: So spill it. Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
SUGAR: What's the surprise?
JERRY: Uh-uh. Not yet.
SUGAR: When?
JERRY: We better have a drink first.
SUGAR: Here. This'll put hair on your chest.
JERRY: No fair guessing.
DOLORES: This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
JERRY: It's private. Go away.
