Gave two week notice and they offered me an ABSURD amount of money to stay - Too good to be true?
Been at the same company since I was in college (4.5 years) started off doing payroll, followed by billing/accounts receivable and now I am transitioning into more of an accounting role.  I applied for a job with the state and somehow landed it.  It was a 45% raise, amazing benefits, pension etc.

I gave my two week notice and my boss and upper management were devastated.  They had big plans for me as I was supposed to take over my bosses role but between the low pay and lack of new work being given to me I had to get out.

They offered me an insane amount of money ($90k vs $71k at the state) and they will pay for me to get my masters degree.  My friends are saying this is a no brainer and to take the money, whereas my family thinks the state makes sense given the pension and job security.  

I don't know why I am so skeptical but $90k is such an absurd amount of money for someone my age and with my experience, especially given what I do isn't complicated whatsoever and I can probably do it in 30 hours.  We do not have a 401k which is why the pay is so significant and if all goes well I will be taking over for my boss who makes over 200k with a bonus (2-3 years away).

Am I being an idiot for even hesitating?  My commute is 8 minutes and they basically let me do whatever I want.  Please help me make what is probably the biggest decision in my life!
