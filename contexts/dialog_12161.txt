HAROLD: Fifty years?
SHUTTLE: You're making a joke.
HAROLD: I'm interested in long-term expectations.
SHUTTLE: It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
HAROLD: Things. Oh--you silly people and your things. Things, things, things.
PENELOPE: You and Harold are friends?
SHUTTLE: He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope. He's the most complicated guy I ever met. I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
HAROLD: Things.
PENELOPE: You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
SHUTTLE: If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
HAROLD: Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit! Look after your things, your things!
PENELOPE: And you, Colonel? Let me guess: You don't know.
LOOSELEAF: I dunno.
HAROLD: Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him. You know?
HAROLD: What's this?
LOOSELEAF: I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy. You know?
HAROLD: In what way, pray tell?
LOOSELEAF: I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
HAROLD: Tit for tat--as simple as that.
LOOSELEAF: You never played a violin.
HAROLD: You did?
LOOSELEAF: Yeah. I practically forgot. But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly. That belonged to everybody. Maybe he would have sold it to me
HAROLD: Maybe it's time you got out.
LOOSELEAF: Me?
HAROLD: You.
LOOSELEAF: Okay. Okay.
HAROLD: You're an imbecile.
LOOSELEAF: I know you think that.
HAROLD: Everybody thinks that.
LOOSELEAF: Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
HAROLD: The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
LOOSELEAF: I don't think so. It could have been.
HAROLD: If what?
LOOSELEAF: If I hadn't done it. If I'd said to myself, Screw it. I'm going to let all those people down there live.""
HAROLD: They were enemies. We were at war.
LOOSELEAF: Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy. That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there
HAROLD: Goodbye, Looseleaf.
LOOSELEAF: So long, you guys.
PENELOPE: What will you do, Colonel?
LOOSELEAF: I dunno. Marry the first whore who's nice to me, I guess. Get a job in a motorcycle shop. So long, you guys.
SHUTTLE: Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
HAROLD: What?
SHUTTLE: We got to get another pilot.
HAROLD: For what?
SHUTTLE: For Africa.
HAROLD: Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
SHUTTLE: You invited me.
HAROLD: To make an ass of yourself.
SHUTTLE: What went wrong?
HAROLD: We're ahead of schedule, that's all. You're finding out here what you would have found out in Africa-- that you are a rabbit, born to be eaten alive.
SHUTTLE: Gee whiz--
HAROLD: It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
SHUTTLE: I wouldn't drop my gun.
HAROLD: You're hollow, like a woman.
SHUTTLE: I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
HAROLD: He can shoot! He can hold his ground! He can attack! You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
SHUTTLE: How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
HAROLD: Look how you're acting now! This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying. Slug me!
SHUTTLE: You're my buddy.
HAROLD: Out! Out!
SHUTTLE: No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
HAROLD: Out!
SHUTTLE: You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
HAROLD: Thank God!
HAROLD: Well--what have we here? A family.
PENELOPE: Almost a Christmas scene.
HAROLD: Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
PENELOPE: Just one favor.
HAROLD: Money? There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery. You'll probably get the baseball team.
PENELOPE: I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
