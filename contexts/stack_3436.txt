Why request and response calls in my burp suite python plugin come in such random order? So I am trying to write this burp plugin using jython and python for burp suite. Now in the processHttpMessage body, I found before a proper execution of the entire method takes place for one request message, it starts executing for another request message. Why is this? And how can I stop it from happening?
