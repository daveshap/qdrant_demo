MONTCALM: Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
MUNRO: And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
MONTCALM: Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
MUNRO: Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
MONTCALM: You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
MUNRO: However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
MONTCALM: Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves. Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
MUNRO: Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
