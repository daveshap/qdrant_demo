They Checked My References.
Hi y’all!

Last week I had a campus interview that I think went incredibly well. Several days ago I received some info confirming that they were checking my references. However, now I am at the point of the waiting game. 

I know nothing is definitive until I have the contract in hand, ready to sign. However, I was wondering do y’all contact multiple candidate references in your searches, or your top candidate? What are some other factors that could be at play here that would result in a waiting period after reference screenings?

I’m attempting to ease my anxiety/excitement, so I thought hearing from colleagues would help. Thank you in advance!
