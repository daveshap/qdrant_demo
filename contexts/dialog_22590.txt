CARTER: Where do we find him?
LAFONTAINE: You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
HAN: I am so sorry about your men.
RUSS: Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7. As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Å’em.
HAN: And Mr. Lee? Where is he?
RUSS: Don't worry, he's with Carter.
