It might just be my gf, but dating a first-timer is the most chill dating there could ever be.
I think people kinda change when they go through multiple breakups. They subconsciously start looking for problems and drama because that's what they're used to. They also tend to get obsessive and suspicious about the smallest things. Of course, I could be completely wrong, but I think that stuff is generally missing in people who date for the first time.



No drama, no whining, no fake feelings or illogical behaviours. Just straight-up genuine love. I don't even think we've ever seriously argued, most of the time we just laugh and mess around. It's been like that for two years now.
 


I also compare her to me. I've had a few ex partners and sometimes I don't even realize what stupid things go through my head and how obsessive I get. Things that she doesn't even notice because she doesn't know drama. And then I realize how stupid I am sometimes. But at least I can control that and don't let it go beyond my mind. That's why we've never fought. And the fact that she's generally an amazing person.


I'm not really sure where I'm going with that. Maybe I want more people to realize how stupid and childish most "issues" in relationships are. Most likely they're not issues, you just make them be.
