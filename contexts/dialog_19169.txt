MICKEY: How come you never talk?
ROGER: She was born without a tongue.
MICKEY: Oh my God! Sorry.
WAYNE: So we got a deal. Four deputies---
WURLITZER: And me.
WAYNE: Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
WURLITZER: Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
WAYNE: Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
WURLITZER: Don't call my men assholes.
WAYNE: I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
