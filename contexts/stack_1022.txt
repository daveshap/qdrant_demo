Search is useless. How can I force it to index my hard drive (2018) I am running Bionic Beaver and am unable to find any of my files in the standard (is it still called Unity?) GUI. If I go to a folder, it seems to be able to find those files afterward, but this is useless for files I don't already know the location of. These are actually separate problems for searching from the dock using META and searching using Ctrl+F from the file browser (is this still called Nautilus?) I believe there are earlier versions of this question but I haven't found anything that seems to apply to my set-up yet.
