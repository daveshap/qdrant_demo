Would a 4 day work week with 10 hours each day be too tiring and draining?
So for my new job I have a couple different scheduling options. It’s a 40 hour work week in total. I could do a regular 8 hour workday, 5 days a week or I could do 4 days a week, 10 hours each day. I could also do an alternate of the two, like 8 hours all 5 days one week and then 10 hours for 4 days the next week, and keep that pattern.

What do you think would be best? This will be my first full time job and I want to do well, so I don’t want to work a schedule where I’m exhausted by the middle of the week. I’m leaning towards the 10 hours for 4 days schedule because it cuts commute costs, but I don’t know if the loss of energy is worth it.
