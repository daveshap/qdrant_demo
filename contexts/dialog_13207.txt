PINHEAD: A dark star rising. I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed. A friend relieved me of that inconvenience. Now I'm free. Born again of Blood and Desire.
JP: Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
PINHEAD: You see, we're not so dissimilar.
JP: But how in God's name ...
PINHEAD: God? My God was diamond and black light. And I was his Dark Pope. All that is changed. A terrible beauty is born. With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
JP: How do we start?
PINHEAD: It has already begun.
