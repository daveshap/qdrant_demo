MAN: How ya doin'?
GARY: Mr. Mohra?
MAN: Yah.
GARY: Officer Olson.
MAN: Yah, right-o.
MAN: ...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.' And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
GARY: Uh-huh.
MAN: So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
GARY: I unnerstand.
MAN: And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?' So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
GARY: Ya got that right.
MAN: And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
GARY: White Bear Lake?
MAN: Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
GARY: Oh sure.
MAN: So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
GARY: What'd this guy look like anyways?
MAN: Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
GARY: Uh-huh - in what way?
MAN: Just a general way.
GARY: Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
MAN: Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
GARY: Yah, got a front movin' in.
MAN: Ya got that right.
