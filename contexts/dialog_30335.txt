SCOTTIE: It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
MADELEINE: It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
SCOTTIE: Yes --
MADELEINE: But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
SCOTTIE: Tell me.
MADELEINE: There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
SCOTTIE: Go on.
MADELEINE: At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
SCOTTIE: -- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
MADELEINE: Yes?! But --
SCOTTIE: It's all there. It's no dream.
SCOTTIE: You've been there before. You've seen it.
MADELEINE: No, never!
SCOTTIE: Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
MADELEINE: No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
