NYAH: Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
ETHAN: This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
NYAH: But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
ETHAN: Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
NYAH: I'd like a little more conviction..
ETHAN: So would I. But it's not mine to give.
NYAH: You've either got it or you don't. Let your conscience be your guide?
ETHAN: Something like that.
NYAH: But I don't have a conscience. I'm a bloody thief.
ETHAN: You can be a thief and have a conscience.
NYAH: No. You can be a thief and have a conscience: Not me. Why did you have to tell me about this! What do I have to do to get away from this guy? When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does. And it looks like he's done it again. You know his definition of a true paranoid?
ETHAN: I don't.
NYAH: Someone in possession of all the facts. Are you telling me I have to do this?
ETHAN: Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
NYAH: And that's the only reason?
ETHAN: Can you think of a better one?
NYAH: Not me. I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
ETHAN: Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
NYAH: Much.
ETHAN: Then feel better!..
NYAH: Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message. Not after the way we broke up.
ETHAN: What wouldn't make him suspicious?
NYAH: Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
