Moved to abroad for US owned company. Immediate breach of contract.
So through an old boss and friend (or so I thought), I recently relocated to take a job in the Balkans for a chemist job of a business owned by US investors. 

I'd met the people a few months prior and they seemed alright. We had a contract that seemed good to go. I was in NZ at the time just skating by and running from medical bills back in the US, so I needed the money. 

That said, as soon as I was on the ground, the contract was immediately breached. The employer (US owner) started paying me in half payments via sketchy US-US acct wire transfers calling them "loans" so that he wouldn't have to deal with the tax withholdings as a US citizen. 

A month into it, they had had enough of my trying to follow US tax and local immigration laws, and terminated me without reason into total breach of the contract. Now, I'm stuck in this part of Europe whilr they still owe me money and have no idea what I should be doing about my tax situation? I know I'm an idiot for taking this job but I trusted my friend and old boss and really didn't think they would f*** me this badly right at the start. 

What should I do about the situation on the whole?
