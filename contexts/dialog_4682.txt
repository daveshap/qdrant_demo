MARIE: He's dead isn't he?
BOURNE: Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
MARIE: He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
BOURNE: -- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
MARIE: He came to kill us.
BOURNE: -- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
MARIE: You knew he was coming.
BOURNE: No.
MARIE: I trusted you.
BOURNE: You're wrong. I didn't know.
MARIE: I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
BOURNE: I didn't know this would happen.
MARIE: He had my picture! He knew I was here! He came here to kill us!
BOURNE: And where is he now? You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
MARIE: Oh, Jesus...
BOURNE: You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know -- But I can't stay here. <u>I can't</u>.
MARIE: But the police --
BOURNE: -- there's no time --
MARIE: -- we'll explain it --
BOURNE: -- how? --
MARIE: -- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
BOURNE: -- forget it --
MARIE: -- we'll tell them what happened --
BOURNE: I don't know what happened! I don't know who he is! I don't know what he wants! I don't even know who I am! The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
