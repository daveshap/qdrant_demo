ROBERTO: I have already rented the apartment to another family.
VITO: I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay. As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
ROBERTO: I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants. They're paying a higher rent.
VITO: How much more a month?
ROBERTO: Eh... Five dollars more.
VITO: Here is the six month's increase in advance. You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman. See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
ROBERTO: Like hell! And who the hell are you to give me orders. Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
