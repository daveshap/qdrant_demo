Got Romance Scammed Again, sort of
Well years ago, I was in contact with this russian lady, cute, sent me photos, and we had this long distance thing going on. 

Short story, she wanted me to help pay for her to come to America. Boy was I dumb, and naive. After talking to my parent's I realized how naive I was. 

And this was over 10+ years ago.

I'm 51, about 2-3 week's ago, stupid me, placed an advert in the craigslist, and got a response. With this lady named Shannon. 

Said she lived in my state, and but had family in Phillipines, etc.

I had indicated that I wanted to meet her, before deciding how well we got along. Almost immediately she ignored that, and kept giving me lovey dovey talk.

Then I got an email about 5 hours ago, saying she had medical problems in the Phillipines, and wanted me to send her 300 bucks.

I just sent a response, tolding whoever this was to "Get Lost".

I know I am a lonely man, but why do I let these idiots scam me and hurt me so much, lol.

Just very frustrating.

My life is moving forward, joined Toastmasters, going back to college in the Spring. Volunteering at the local community to help with English Second Language.

But outside of that I have no job, no friends, no one really show's any interest in hanging with me.

I am just tired of that I have to be always the one to show interest in others, why do other people refuse to show any interest in me?

Am I so horrible?
