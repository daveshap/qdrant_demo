COLONEL: Did you call the Zoo?
AIDE: Yes, sir. We're in luck. The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public. They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot. And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
COLONEL: Me, too. Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse. Have we fed them? Like raw steak or something?
AIDE: The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
COLONEL: Good God.
AIDE: They suggested oranges.
