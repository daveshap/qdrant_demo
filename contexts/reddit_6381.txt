Got a dream job with an unconventional (I think) strategy. Advice inside
This may not work for everyone, but it sure worked for me. 

I wanted to write for a living, and I couldn't find a job out of college, so I just started my own business. I created a website and worked freelance for really, really cheap. I never made much doing it, but I slowly built up a reputation for being professional and timely (and affordable). When I went to apply to the job at the big agency I've had my eye on, I had a year experience doing this kind of writing and a long list of references from a variety of businesses. 

The key to the success was that the business wasn't just me. I also brought on friends who were in similar boats but different fields (developer and graphic designer) so we were able to offer a variety of solutions for cheap money and handle nearly any project collectively. 

Sure, it was a lot of work and I did it nights while working jobs I didn't love during the day, but now I have my dream job, so I have no complaints at all. Just something to think about for those of you who are unemployed and looking all over, but of course it won't work for every field. 

If anyone has any questions, I'd gladly answer
