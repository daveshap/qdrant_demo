When to send a follow up email Vs. when to give up on an application?
I did a phone interview and was supposed to hear “early this week”. I already sent a thank you note the day I interviewed. Should I follow up expressing continued interest? Is this too over zealous? At what point do I just accept that I won’t hear from them?
