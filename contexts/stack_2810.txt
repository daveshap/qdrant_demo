Relationship between the constancy of the laws of physics and conservation principles I have heard it said before in passing (I think it was on Star Talk Radio) that there is some specific relationship between the constancy of the laws of physics and conservation principles such as the conservation of momentum and conservation of energy. The claim, as I remember it, is that the principle of the conservation of momentum is 'equivalent' to saying that the laws of physics are constant throughout space.Similarly, I heard it said that stating the principle of the conservation of energy is 'equivalent' to saying that the laws of physics are constant throughout all times.In what way are these claims equivalent? In what way does one follow from the other. Or, am I misremembering some of the details of what was said?Sorry if this question is a little bit vague.
