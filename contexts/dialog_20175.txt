TURKLE: I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
MCMURPHY: Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
TURKLE: Oh yeah...
MCMURPHY: I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
TURKLE: Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
MCMURPHY: Come an' see.
TURKLE: That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
MCMURPHY: You's better believe it, brother!
TURKLE: Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
MCMURPHY: Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
TURKLE: Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.
