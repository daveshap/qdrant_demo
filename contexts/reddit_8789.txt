Are major sports leagues essentially monopolies?
**Context of the case**: ["The Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/259us200), Maryland was a baseball club and a member of the Federal League of Professional Base Ball Players. The National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs and the American League of Professional Base Ball Clubs conspired to monopolize the business of professional baseball by buying out members of the Federal League and by inducing members of the Federal League to leave.  The Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore brought suit in the Supreme Court for the District of Columbia against the other leagues under the Sherman Act and obtained a verdict for $80,000. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia reversed the lower court's ruling and held that the defendant baseball leagues were not within the Sherman Act's purview. The Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court."

The question under consideration by the Supreme Court in *Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore, Inc. v National League* was whether or not the activities of the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs and the American League of Professional Base Ball Clubs were subject to the Sherman Act.  [The Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Baseball_Club_v._National_League) held that the baseball leagues were not subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act because the exhibitions that are baseball games are not trade or commerce as properly understood under the commerce clause.  In 1952, the Supreme Court had another opportunity to reverse the decision with *George Earl Toolson v New York Yankees Inc, et. al*, and in a one-paragraph per curium opinion, upheld it on the grounds that this [issue should remain under legislative purview and therefore should be left alone by the Court.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolson_v._New_York_Yankees,_Inc.)

Do E-sports qualify as sport(s)?  Does the prevalence of sports betting qualify consolidated sports leagues like the MLB, NBA or NFL, or any other corporation for that matter, for regulation under the federal commerce clause or current anti-trust laws due to the ruling in [*Murphy v National Collegiate Athletic Association*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy_v._National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association)?
