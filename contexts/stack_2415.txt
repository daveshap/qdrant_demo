Extracting the z-values of a stream in a watershed if I have the values of the contours I have the z-values of the contours (physical contours) of a watershed in AutoCAD civil, but I may use them in ArcGIS 10.2 and I have already created a DEM. I need to extract the z-values for the stream, in order to create the AgreeDem and to continue with the fill and flow accumulation process in ArcGIS.
