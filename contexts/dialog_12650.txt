RACHEL: It isn't over, is it, Conner?
MACLEOD: No.
RACHEL: How can that be?
MACLEOD: I don't know.
RACHEL: Is there anything else you need?
MACLEOD: No -- I'm fine. Thank you.
RACHEL: I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
MACLEOD: Me too.
FARMER: It will be a good harvest this year.
MCCLEOD: Can you really tell from doing that?
FARMER: What do you think?
MCCLEOD: I think you just like to eat dirt.
SARAH: Would you care for some water, Conner?
MCCLEOD: Aye -- that I would, lass.
FARMER: I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
MCCLEOD: She's a treasure she is.
FARMER: She'll soon be of age.
MCCLEOD: Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
FARMER: I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
