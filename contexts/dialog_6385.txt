JONAS: If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed. How's Jerry feeling this morning?
LIZA: Fine. What the hell is going on?
JONAS: Please, sit.
JONAS: What I'm about to tell you is partially documented. The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't. For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
LIZA: Truth'll set you free. I'm listening.
JONAS: Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program. Are you familiar with it?
LIZA: It was mind control. <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
JONAS: A vulgar pop term, but yes. Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin. That was our goal.
LIZA: Ask what you can do for your country. That kind of thing.
JONAS: M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed. EX CATCHER.
LIZA: As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
JONAS: I am impressed. We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
JONAS: We experimented with hallucinogens. We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state. We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
LIZA: Terminal?
JONAS: As in 'resulting in death.' We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
LIZA: If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
JONAS: Me? I was a minor missionary, a heretic really. But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs? Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
LIZA: Missionary? Penance? You talk about it like it was a religion.
JONAS: It was. It was.
LIZA: Jerry told me he bit your nose.
JONAS: And what did I say?
LIZA: A dog.
JONAS: <u>My dog</u>. One I intend to put to sleep. Extrapolate from there.
LIZA: These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
JONAS: Yes, that's right.
