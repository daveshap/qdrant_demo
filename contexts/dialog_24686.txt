AMY: It was such a long time ago.
NICK: Still--
AMY: If Ed ever found out....
NICK: Or Kat....
AMY: And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
JEFFREY: You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
KAT: Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.

KAT: Not for a dog.
JEFFREY: Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
KAT: Is this supposed to be an apology?

JEFFREY: You’re not even listening.
KAT: When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
