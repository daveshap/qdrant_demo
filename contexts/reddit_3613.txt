A friendly reminder to keep your options open...
Was dating a guy last month who I was pretty excited about, had some small red flags that he might not be ready for something serious but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Turned out to be pretty flaky and just suddenly not making me a priority. Was upset about it, but decided to keep my options open and continue to go on dates.

Had a really nice date last night and at the end he said how he had a great time. When we hugged goodbye he said "So, I would normally try to play coy, but I would really like to see you again. Do you want to XX on Monday night?" (It was an activity we talked about during the date).

It was nice after this other guy making me feel like shit basically to just be like you know what, I *am* a catch and the right guy *will* make the time for me and be excited about me. It was also refreshing for someone not to play games and give the green light to I'M INTERESTED.

Keep your head up y'all, and get out there.

EDIT: this popped off way more than I anticipated. And things certainly didnâ€™t translate within my post. I was not trying to brag, amongst other things. I simply meant it as ENCOURAGEMENT for those who were dating people who made them feel insignificant.
