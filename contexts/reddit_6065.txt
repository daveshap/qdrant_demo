Jobs worth the training during quarantine
I'm fortunate enough to still be getting paycheck likely at least into the next 12 months. I currently am entertaining any and all areas of potential opportunities to prepare for the future for my family. No one can predict the future but I figure at the very least I can use my free time wisely for self improvement. I also am mindful that any potential stable career worth pursuing should ideally of interest to me. 

One such career as an example I thought of is real estate. Relatively low cost of entry and likely still going to be operational in the future. I fully understand this is a competitive industry though. Another area I've heard about is cyber security. 

So my questions are: 

What jobs or careers are worth pursuing in the future 

Whats are some jobs that someone can self study or at least read up on during this period of downtime?

Any information/suggestions are much appreciated.
