KITTLE: How's your precious little school-marm today?
BILLY-BOY: She's fine, as if you cared.
KITTLE: Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville? I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
BILLY-BOY: Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
KITTLE: Nothing, I guess. Just an observation. She's really something special. You're a lucky fella.
BILLY-BOY: Lay off once, would you?
KITTLE: What'd I say?
BILLY-BOY: It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
NENA: You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
BILLY-BOY: Wha... ?
NENA: Birth control's important.
BILLY-BOY: What... what kinda thing is that to say?
KITTLE: She's right. If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you daddy.""
BILLY-BOY: Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this. Leave off. Here's your paper.
KITTLE: What, am I supposed to read it while I drive? Keep a grip on it, alright?
NENA: You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
BILLY-BOY: Bullshit.
NENA: You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics. The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
BILLY-BOY: I'm back here, aren't I? So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
NENA: Oh... okay.
