LANGE: Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
TREVOR: What?
LANGE: The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
TREVOR: Thanks.
LANGE: We're all here for you Trevor.
