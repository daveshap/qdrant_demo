MR. HENRY: Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
ANTHONY: So do I.
MR. HENRY: Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
ANTHONY: I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
MR. HENRY: I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
ANTHONY: What do you mean what kind of person? He's a good person.
MR. HENRY: Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods up here.
ANTHONY: I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
MR. HENRY: As far as I can tell he hasn't thought his life through. He'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. But business? You I can work with. You I could groom. Dignan's not going to make it.
