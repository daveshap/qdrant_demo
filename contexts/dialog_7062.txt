HERBAL: Nobody there to sign for it, mon. What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
NORMAL: So you just decided to return it to the sender. Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
HERBAL: Like de prophets say, Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman.""
NORMAL: Which is none of your business...or mine.
HERBAL: It concerns only Jah. But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
NORMAL: Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
NORMAL: This is a hot run. Beat it. You're late.
MAX: I was on call.
NORMAL: I want you on call here.
MAX: What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
NORMAL: More like deployed in bed asleep.
MAX: I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
NORMAL: And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
MAX: He's sick.
NORMAL: For a change.
MAX: How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this. The guy is seriously not well.
NORMAL: You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
MAX: I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
MAX: Morning, Sunshine...
ORIGINAL CINDY: Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike. Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes. So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
MAX: At least he didn't swing with your ride.
ORIGINAL CINDY: No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
ORIGINAL CINDY: Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that? Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
MAX: Straight.
ORIGINAL CINDY: Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
