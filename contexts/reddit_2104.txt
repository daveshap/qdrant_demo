Carnegie Mellon Application Decision
Dear Carnegie Mellon Admissions Committee,

Thank you for your interest in giving me a Carnegie Mellon rejection letter.

I have reviewed your letter and am impressed with your rejection reasons and other suggestions. However, I have received many rejection letters this year. Therefore, after careful consideration of your letter, I have decided not to accept your rejection letter.

Please understand that this is not a negative evaluation of your letter, but rather a reflection of my unique choice criteria.

Once again, I appreciate your courage to give me a rejection letter and wish you every success in your future rejecting.

I'll see you on campus in August.

Best wishes,
u/i_r0n_ic
Class of 2024 Applicant
