XAVIER: The point of what?
LOGAN: This. This whole God damn thing. Making yourselves into some sort of team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature. For what?"
XAVIER: The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility. To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
LOGAN: What if it never happens? What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
XAVIER: Now that's Magneto talking.
LOGAN: No. That's me talking. And you know what? It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
XAVIER: I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
