I went to a new psychiatrist today
And I loved it.
He made me feel so much better about my guilt.
All my friends and family say that I should try harder, that are people out there with high functioning depression, and I have to make more of an effort.

 I always feel awful about that and I believe them

But he told me that this is a disease like diabetes, not all people have the same type of diabetes, and the treatment is not the same to everyone. 

Lack of will power and extreme guilt are symptoms of depression, and there is nothing I can do.... except the treatment. 

As long as I'm treating myself, I'm doing the best I can. 

I moved to another country so I'm 1 year without therapy, and I just changed meds when I was visiting my family  during the holidays, I should have gone to a psychiatric here last month to check, but I didn't. 

He up the dosis of my meds and will suggest me a therapist.

I treat my depression for 7 years, I heard that all before, but when everyone is saying the same thing over and over again it's easy to forget.

If you have depression and are not being treated, you really should. 
That friend that said that had depression after the break up and "cured" themselves, so you also don't need a treatment? wasn't depressed, just sad. 
If you don't have money, you can find free help in universities or institutions, it may be far and a bit inconvenient, but is so worth it.

It takes a while for you to find the right medication, but when you find it, the world changes. For real. 
and therapy is so important, I don't know how I survived 1 year without it. 


Fun fact: when he asked me who told me those things about how I should try harder and that are people out there who has depression and still work and go to school, I said that nobody told me that.

I don't know why I lied.

Ok, not that fun. 

I just want to encourage anyone here who is avoiding treatment. You should try it, please. 
It really does help. 

Treat yo self
