Can we adress the disconnect between "Guys only want sex/I can't find relationship/I only get messages and go on dates from creepy guys" and "hey! I'm a guy and I can barely get a response"
title says its all. yeah, I realize there is a disconnect - that does not suprise me. what suprises me is the fact that both sexes seem utterly confused as to why the other has these problems.  

why the hell is there this disconnect? why do I get the impression that so many women truly believe that they are going to be alone forever because "guys only want sex, I only get creepy guys", yet, at the same time, men are pulling their hairs out because they biggest frustration they have is feeling like they are never going to find someone to grow old with because they cant even get a message returned.

So, where does the disconnect lay? is it because only the people that have issues complain and we don't hear about the successes as much? is it because the guys that do want relationships are not wanted by the girls that also want relationships, and vice versa?
