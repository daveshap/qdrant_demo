How do I meet someone without Tinder?
It feels kinda sad that I have to ask this, but how do you actually meet someone irl? Tinder is crushing me very slowly, and the only reason I don't delete it, is because I can't find someone to date without it.

I'm massively into gaming to the point where it's also my career, so I could easily get into a ldr, but I swore not to. And I just don't get how I could find someone irl, with gaming as a similar interest.
