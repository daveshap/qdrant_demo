CALLER: I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
PETER: Then call them!
ANDY: Are you crazy?
PETER: Let's see how much he wants to play.
CALLER: Just for that no hint today.
PETER: Why are you doing this? You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
CALLER: Pain? Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
PETER: And you want these girls to feel your pain?
CALLER: Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
PETER: How?
CALLER: I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
PETER: Huxley's quote also says, his play is always fair and just.""
CALLER: So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
ANDY: What in the hell do you think you're doing? Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
PETER: You think you're going to catch him on a trace? Everything he does is planned out well in advance. The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
FRANK: You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
KATHY: Peter's right, Captain. He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
ANDY: We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
PETER: Maybe you should.
ANDY: You don't tell us how to run our investigation. You got that?
PETER: You don't have an investigation without me. You got that?
