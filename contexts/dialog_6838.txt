CECILE: My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
SEBASTIAN: How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
KATHRYN: Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
SEBASTIAN: Outstanding.
CECILE: What year are you in?
SEBASTIAN: I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
CECILE: But I thought high school is only four years.
SEBASTIAN: It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
