Do mob spawn rates change if your alone on a multiplayer server? So if your playing on a multiplayer server with 3-4 people and you make a mob spawner, the mob spawner won't work that well because mobs will spawn near other players but what if everyone leaves and you're the only one there? Would the mob spawner spawn rate be the same as a single player spawn rate? Does it depend on the server?
