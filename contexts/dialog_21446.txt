GRANDFATHER: Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that. Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
THE KID: Yeah. It's really good.
GRANDFATHER: Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
