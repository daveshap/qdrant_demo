Could really use a hug rn
My gf of 4 years broke up with me a little over a year ago and it was due to my lack of noticing habits I has that were toxic, and for the way I dealt with depression about previous life altering events in my life.  
As it stands right now we had our differences but she was the best thing that had ever happened to me. She helped me grow into a mature adult when I was still doing stupid young man shit. She taught me how to be financially stable. She always showed me the other side of the fence when it came to opinions. And she showed me how to really love unconditionally.
Ever since the break up my father has passed away and she wasn't really there to help me through it which I can't blame her for but still kinda hurt. We've talked from time to time since then. Today she mentioned about a trip she was planning to take in July with the new guy she has been seeing. Yes we are broken up and that's that, however feelings that are lingering still just hurt. 
I'm beating myself up over the fact of how much I let myself down and let her slip away. I've made a promise to myself to never take that kind of love for granted again and never treat another partner like that. 
Right now I guess I just miss all the good time we had and can't see it with anyone else. Been hoping this whole time that maybe we would end up hanging out and get back to a more mature relationship. Not the case. I could use a hug. Thanks for reading everyone.
