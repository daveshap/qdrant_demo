BALA: You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
Z: Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
Z: And you are...?
BALA: I'm Princess Bala.
Z: Ah, yes. Well, charmed, I'm sure. So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
BALA: Yes.
Z: Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.
