LAURIE: Jon, I do not want to hear it.
DR. MANHATTAN: I'm sorry. Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
LAURIE: Oh God. I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
DR. MANHATTAN: You're the only human being I care for.
LAURIE: Then do me a favor. If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit. I want you to cure me.
DR. MANHATTAN: I won't do that.
LAURIE: You have the power to do it. I want you to do it. Please.
DR. MANHATTAN: I explained this. I can't. That's not the way it happens.
LAURIE: Jon. If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
LAURIE: What -- am I --
DR. MANHATTAN: Cured, yes.
