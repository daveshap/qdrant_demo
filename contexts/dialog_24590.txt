SUGAR: That's funny - I never slept better. And I had the most wonderful dream. I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
JOE: Yes. Now about our date for tonight...
SUGAR: I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
JOE: I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.
SUGAR: Tomorrow night?
JOE: Not tomorrow, either. You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
SUGAR: Where to? South America? Oh. That is unexpected.
JOE: You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
SUGAR: A merger? How long will you be gone?
JOE: Quite a while. As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
SUGAR: You're not?
JOE: It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
SUGAR: Oh - that kind of a merger. Is she young? Pretty?
JOE: According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so. But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
SUGAR: Oh, of course. I understand. At least, I think I do.
JOE: I knew you would.
JOE: I only wish there were something I could do for you.
SUGAR: But you have. You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
JOE: Smart move. Oh, by the way - did you get my flowers? You know, those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over Long Island, and they flew them down this morning.
