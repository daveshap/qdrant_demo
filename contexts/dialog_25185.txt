SAAVIK: New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
DAVID: Short range scan.
SAAVIK: As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
DAVID: Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
SAAVIK: ... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
DAVID: I don't believe it...
ESTEBAN: What is it?
SAAVIK: If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
ESTEBAN: You said there wouldn't be any.
DAVID: There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
SAAVIK: Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
COMM OFFICER: Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
ESTEBAN: Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
DAVID: Why don't we beam it up?
ESTEBAN: Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?"
DAVID: Not from here, no.
SAAVIK: Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
ESTEBAN: ... If the Captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." I know the book
DAVID: Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
SAAVIK: ... Or <u>who</u>.
ESTEBAN: All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
DAVID: Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
