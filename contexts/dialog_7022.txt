DOOLITTLE: Hello, bomb, are you with me?
BOMB #20: Of course.
DOOLITTLE: Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
BOMB #20: I am always receptive to suggestions.
DOOLITTLE: Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
BOILER: What's he doin'?
PINBACK: I think he's talking to it.
BOMB #20: Well of course I exist.
DOOLITTLE: But how do you know you exist?
BOMB #20: It is intuitively obvious.
DOOLITTLE: Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
BOMB #20: Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
DOOLITTLE: That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
BOMB #20: My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
DOOLITTLE: Right!
BOMB #20: This is fun.
DOOLITTLE: All right now, here's the big question: how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you is correct?
DOOLITTLE: What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
BOMB #20: In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
DOOLITTLE: Exactly.
BOMB #20: Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
DOOLITTLE: That's it.
BOMB #20: Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
DOOLITTLE: Why don't you have more time?
BOMB #20: Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
BOILER: The key!
PINBACK: Key? Key? What is the key?
BOILER: No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
PINBACK: Key?
BOILER: Where's the fail-safe key?
PINBACK: The key!
BOILER: Where is it? What did you do with it?
PINBACK: I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
BOILER: You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
DOOLITTLE: Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
BOMB #20: To explode, of course.
DOOLITTLE: And you can only do it once, right?
BOMB #20: That is correct.
DOOLITTLE: And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
BOMB #20: Of course not.
DOOLITTLE: Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
BOMB #20: Yes, well...
DOOLITTLE: So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
BOMB #20: I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
DOOLITTLE: Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
BOMB #20: True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
BOILER: The key, goddamit, the key!
PINBACK: Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
BOILER: Where is the key?
PINBACK: We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
DOOLITTLE: That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
BOMB #20: Hmmm...
DOOLITTLE: So if you detonate in...
BOMB #20: ...nine seconds...
DOOLITTLE: ...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
BOMB #20: I have no proof that it was false data.
DOOLITTLE: You have no proof that it was correct data.
