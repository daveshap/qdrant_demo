How to restore one table from full backup in Sybase ASE I need to retrieve 2 data records that were in a single table from yesterday's backup. How can I restore a single table from a full backup in Sybase? Or is it possible to retrieve the required records from the dump file itself? Can I somehow load the dump file without recovering to the production database? I don't have enough disk space to recover the database to a temporary database on the same disks/server.
