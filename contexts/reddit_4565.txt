I feel down for no reason at times, even while being with friends
Sometimes I’ll be doing good and having fun with friends and then I just start feeling sad. They’ll usually ask if I’m good and stuff and I say things like “yeah I’m fine”. I don’t really believe myself, and I know they don’t either at times. They tell me they are there to talk if I need, but since I feel depressed for no reason I don’t know what I would say to them. I want to talk about it but all I know is that I randomly feel depressed for no reason, there’s no big event or smaller event it’s just random. What are some things I could talk about? They want to help me and I’d like to receive it, but what am I supposed to do? Just tell them I feel depressed for no reason at times?
