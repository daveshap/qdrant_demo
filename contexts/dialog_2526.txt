MARTY: Fine..
GEORGE: Learn anything?
MARTY: Oh yeah.
GEORGE: Good.
EILEEN: By the way, that reminds me... Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
GEORGE: Eileen, Chinese food again?
EILEEN: George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
