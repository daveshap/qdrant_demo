Mental health and not able to work. What to do?
Hi. I'm 17 and live in the North West of England, Lancashire exactly. I have been professionally diagnosed with depression and have had various plans and procedures to go all the way, if you understand what I mean and have been utilising Simaritins a lot as well as visiting hospital very soon. I am also working with the early intervention team for psychosis and PTSD. I haven't been diagnosed yet however I have a fair few symptoms and traits of psychosis and a lot more regarding the PTSD. 

Because of this I'm not currently able to work, it's not safe for me or customers as I've had bad experiences in the past working (self harm during work as an example) however it's come now to the point where I have no way of making money which for me personally I really want to do in terms of learning to drive, going out, socialising, fitness etc. Because of a lack of money I can't do that. 

I'm only asking here because is there anyway for me to claim any form of money from the government or is my case not a good enough one? I want to be able to move on in life and try to beat my several issues but without money it's really hard to step forwards into adulthood properly. Is there a law which would allow me to claim benefits or something along those lines? And if not is there any other ways I could make money from home at the age of 17? Thanks for the help, much appreciated. :)
