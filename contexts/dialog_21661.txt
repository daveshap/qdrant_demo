THE MARQUIS: Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
COULMIER: What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
THE MARQUIS: But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
COULMIER: But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
THE MARQUIS: Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
COULMIER: Enough to discern its tenor.
THE MARQUIS: And --?
COULMIER: It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like nipple" and "pikestaff" --"
THE MARQUIS: There I was taxed; it's true.
COULMIER: And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
THE MARQUIS: I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
COULMIER: But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
THE MARQUIS: It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
COULMIER: But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
THE MARQUIS: I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
COULMIER: One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
THE MARQUIS: It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
COULMIER: More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
THE MARQUIS: They can't be serious.
COULMIER: Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
THE MARQUIS: Mightier than the sword indeed.
COULMIER: Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
THE MARQUIS: Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
COULMIER: You among them?
