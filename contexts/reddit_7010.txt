Second time getting laid off in less than two years. Is this poor reflection on me?
I’m a lab technician with my bachelors in biology. I have been working in labs for over 3 years now. 

First lab I worked at was a research grant funded position and they laid me off after two years due to my PI moving states and taking her grant funding with her. Afterwards I took a low paying job in a lab that I didn’t enjoy and only stayed there 6 months till I got my current job. My current job ive worked for 10 months contracting for a government laboratory. Yesterday I got word that the contract funding has been cut and so they have to close mine and two other peoples contracts by the end of this month. 


I’ve been beating myself up pretty hard about it. Given that this is the second time I have been laid off in less than two years. I can’t help but think this will reflect poorly upon me when it comes to applying for other jobs. Is it normal to be laid off this often?
