LO: No more hitting on the head! All this trouble for a comb?
JEN: It's mine. It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
LO: Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
JEN: By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
LO: I'm sorry... I guessed wrong. I though you were a Han.
JEN: Give me back my comb.
LO: I don't take orders from anyone.
JEN: Give it back.
LO: When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars. I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan. I used to look for stars alone. I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them. I've been riding in the desert ever since.
JEN: And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit. He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
LO: Out here, you always fight for survival. You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance. Slowly, your gang becomes your family. All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
JEN: So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
LO: I am a man. And now I've found the brightest star of all.
