Can't login because of kernel panic When I restart my computer I usually type my password to log me in. However, when I try to do this now it shows me the following message:<blockquote>  \"Your computer restarted because of a problem\"</blockquote>So I restart my laptop and enter my password again but I still get the same error message. This happens repeatedly if I reboot, so I can't login anymore. After researching this problem I found out that my computer is suffering a kernel panic. I tried the following 3 possible solutions I found to fix this problem:I used the cmd + option + P + R shortcut during startup to reset the NVRAM.I booted into Safe Mode by holding the shift key down while rebooting.I booted into Recovery with the cmd + R keys to get me into OS X Utilities to run First Aid on the Startup Disk. None of the above resolved the issue.Can anyone help me fix this problem?
