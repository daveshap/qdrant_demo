What tools can I use for parametric circuit analysis? I have analog circuit designs that I want to analyze for accuracy, etc. according to the component variations based on tolerance, temperature, etc. To elaborate further, imagine there is a circuit designed with couple of resistors and an opamp, and based on their nominal values we have an expected output. How does this output change based on the possible changes in the circuit element parameters? (tolerance and temperature dependency of the resistors, offset voltage and bias current of the opamp, etc.)
