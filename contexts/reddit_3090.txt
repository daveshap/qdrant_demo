I love paperwork. Like, I love it so much. What careers include Organization tasks, research, and just generally admin stuff?
Hey guys, 

Recently, while working in a temp job, I realised how much I love immersing myself in a specific admin/paperwork task. If you give me thousands of pieces of paper and tell me to sort through them, organise them into a binder, colour code, and find a specific piece of information in a minute, then you make heaven come to earth for me. 

I am studying Law currently (UK), and I want to finish my degree. I love my degree, but Iâ€™m not sure that becoming a solicitor would be for me. I speak languages, and I am very interested in education, social fields like social work, and again, I bloody love paperwork. I am also very social, I am great at talking and debating, and I like to help people with what I do. Research is also one of my strong suits, both in physical versions of data and on the internet. 

Can anyone think of jobs or career paths that might be suitable for me?
