New employer has asked me to start earlier.. I can’t...
Okay so, I’ve got a new job, have the contract signed and dated etc.. they also asked me when I would like to start my new role.. I have said the 2nd December... this is due to me being on holiday from 24-27th November.. they have emailed asking if it is possible for me to start sooner, the week before which I’d be on holiday for anyway (wouldn’t be back til the Thursday).. I’d like to say no but I’m not sure how to go about this as I don’t want to look bad before ive even started.. (probably over thinking this but will they rescind my job offer if I say no?)

If anyone has any tips on what to say, I’d really appreciate it!
