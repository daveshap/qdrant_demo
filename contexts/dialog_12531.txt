BERNIE: What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
CHICK: You mean like Bubber? The hero?
BERNIE: Yeah, like that. Same thing.
CHICK: Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern? Is this a riddle or what?
BERNIE: I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me? Ya wouldn't, would ya?
CHICK: It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it. No offense. Me neither. I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy. Heroic. You and me, we're not... heroic. It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined. What about it?
BERNIE: Nothin'.
CHICK: I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern. A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
BERNIE: The thing is, Chick. I'm goin' down.
CHICK: Down. You mean jail? For that credit card stuff? For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
