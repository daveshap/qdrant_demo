Maeve's first encounter with an awake host? I saw Westworld a couple of weeks ago, and a scene stuck in my mind.I \"remember\" Maeve coming across a person (or a situation) and trying to stop a host (probably giving a command), but failing. She is surprised, and says something along the lines of \"oh, you're awake\".I've downloaded the subtitles of the two seasons and searched for \"awake\" in them in hopes I'll find the scene, but I couldn't. Now, I'm not sure if she really said \"awake\". Also I've been skimming the episodes, but again, I couldn't find it yet.I find that scene kind of important because Maeve is \"awake\" and aware of the hosts. She starts commanding other hosts who are not awake, and she gets accustomed to it. And in this scene, she meets another host who is awake and can't command him/her. This host might not be the first awake host she's encountered, but might be the first that she mentioned him/her being awake.
