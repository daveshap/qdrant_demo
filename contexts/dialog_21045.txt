STEW: And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it—
GALLAGHER: —and that—
STEW: —and those and them.
GALLAGHER: Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
STEW: Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens! And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
GALLAGHER: Of course I haven't got a nose.
STEW: Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
GALLAGHER: On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
STEW: Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
GALLAGHER: And the rest of us are truck horses?
STEW: There you go, talking like a woman!
GALLAGHER: Well!
STEW: Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
