NORRINGTON: Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe. Clap him in irons. And behind his back this time.
ELIZABETH: Commodore, you can't do that!
NORRINGTON: You're speaking up for him again?
ELIZABETH: He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
JACK: We had time to get to know each other.
NORRINGTON: We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
ELIZABETH: No. The pirates have taken Will --
NORRINGTON: Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home. That is what we shall do. Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable. But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
ELIZABETH: Commodore, please!
JACK: Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean. How can you pass that up?
NORRINGTON: By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
ELIZABETH: Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me. As a wedding gift.
NORRINGTON: I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
ELIZABETH: Not as a condition -- a request.
