PAINE: Will the Senator--
JEFFERSON: I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
PAINE: Mr. President! A point of order!
JEFFERSON: Mr. President--
PRESIDENT: Senator Paine will state it!
PAINE: It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
JEFFERSON: Mr. President--
PAINE: He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
JEFFERSON: Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
PAINE: I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
PAINE: I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
PRESIDENT: Order!
PAINE: --to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
