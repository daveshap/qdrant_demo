SANTA: Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
HAMMER: If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
SANTA: Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
HAMMER: Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
SANTA: The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
HAMMER: What's your shpiel, Santa?
SANTA: Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering? Girls.
