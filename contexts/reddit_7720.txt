Can doing a postdoc hurt my chances of getting a job in industry?
I'm nearing the end of my Physics PhD and I'm trying to determine if a postdoc position would be helpful/detrimental to finding a job in industry. I'm not currently interested in pursuing a career in academia, but I've heard research scientist positions in industry/private sector can be just as competitive as faculty positions, and I'm wondering if it would be helpful to complete a postdoc.  


If I'm not successful in getting a research based position with my expertise and would need to job-hunt with a more general scope of the private sector, could the postdoc hurt my chances of being hired? I've heard stories of liability/preference within companies that dissuade them from hiring people with postdocs over Masters and PhDs based on salaries and things of the sort.

Any input would be much appreciated, thanks!
