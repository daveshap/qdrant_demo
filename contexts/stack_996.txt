youtube video is choppy, but audio plays fine I am running ubuntu 18.10 on a Acer Aspire One. When I try to play a youtube video on either chrome of firefox it's really choppy. The audio plays fine, but the video doesn't work. I've tried adjusting my frame rate, but not help. Is there anything I can do to get it to work properly? If any more information is needed I can probably find it. EDIT: the model is D255E.
