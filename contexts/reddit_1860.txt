The parents on this subreddit concern me.
I've had several reach out to me, pestering me with barrages of questions asking how to get their child into the Ivy League. There are fathers and mothers of elementary school children browsing here, trying to pick up tips as they push their kids down a life path that they might not even want.

This is helicopter parenting and it is toxic. Allow your kid to discover this subreddit and apply to top schools by themselves, and don't force them to apply somewhere they don't want to be. It's good to help, and this criticism doesn't apply to all of you, but please for the love of god stop being a tiger parent. It'll only mess up your child later on.
