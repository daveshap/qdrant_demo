HELEN: Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works. Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?

CLAY: What's the matter with her?
MARY: Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
