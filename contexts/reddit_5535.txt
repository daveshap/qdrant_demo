I don’t know what jobs I qualify for or my worth.
I’ve worked a variety of jobs, two that I would say are relevant for a resume. Neither of those are related to what I took in school outside of being good at some very basic math. I’m still in my first position post graduation (spent 6.5 years in school, been at this job for 2 years and am now 27). 

How do you even know what jobs you qualify for? I read postings and think “I could do that, but not this later part” or “I only have 2 years experience but I feel like I could do this job that requires 10” (being hyperbolic). 

I also have financial goals but have no idea of what I should be getting paid based on my current work. 

I feel like a lot of job descriptions lack specificity but as someone with a science + math background I really really hate this (give me clear, concise and objective statements)

Any advice/discussion is welcome.
