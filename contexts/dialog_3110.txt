ALFRED: How are you feeling, young man?
BRUCE: Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
ALFRED: Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
BRUCE: As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
ALFRED: Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
