CHIEF CLERK: Was there something else?
KAFKA: No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation. He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
CHIEF CLERK: No, there's only one report to complete. I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
KAFKA: I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
CHIEF CLERK: The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
KAFKA: Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
