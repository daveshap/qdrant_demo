My mum is getting shit at work and it makes me really sad to hear anyone treat my mum that way.
My mum isn’t the best at defending herself and the people at her workplace seem to be bullying her relentlessly. She’s feeling depressed and is overworked, the tremendous amount of stress she’s under is only exacerbating her medical condition. My mum is different from people at work in personality, temperament, and culture, and it makes me sad to think she’s not fitting in with her co-workers. It makes me angry too, her workplace sounds like an immature highschool drama!
