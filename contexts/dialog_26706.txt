ANSWERING MACHINE: Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if... Skipping message. End of final message.
MIKE: Shit.
ANSWERING MACHINE: You have to put things in perspective.
MIKE: I know, I know.
ANSWERING MACHINE: You've been through worse.
MIKE: You're right. I know.
ANSWERING MACHINE: Ever since I've known you.
MIKE: I don't know about that.
ANSWERING MACHINE: Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
MIKE: It didn't feel that way.
ANSWERING MACHINE: That's because it was a challenge. You has control over you're situation. It was hard, but you rose to it.
MIKE: Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
ANSWERING MACHINE: You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
MIKE: Enough. I've got to use the phone.
ANSWERING MACHINE: Are you calling Her?
MIKE: No. Stop, come on.
TRENT: Hello?
MIKE: S'up Trent?
TRENT: Lemme get off the other line, baby.
ANSWERING MACHINE: You should call your Grandmother.
MIKE: Shuddup.
TRENT: That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
MIKE: I don't know...
TRENT: Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
MIKE: Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
TRENT: Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
MIKE: I don't know...
TRENT: I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
MIKE: We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
TRENT: You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
MIKE: What are you talking about? Vegas?
TRENT: VEGAS.
MIKE: What Vegas?
TRENT: We're going to Vegas.
MIKE: When?
TRENT: Tonight, baby.
MIKE: You're crazy.
TRENT: I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
MIKE: I'm not going to Vegas.
TRENT: Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
MIKE: I can't lose more than a hundred.
TRENT: Just bring your card. Half an hour.
MIKE: Wait.
TRENT: What?
MIKE: What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
TRENT: Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
MIKE: No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
TRENT: Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
MIKE: Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
TRENT: Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
MIKE: I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
TRENT: I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
MIKE: I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
TRENT: I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
MIKE: Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
TRENT: Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
MIKE: Vegas!
TRENT: Vegas, baby!
MIKE: Vegas!
TRENT: Vegas.
MIKE: Vegas.
TRENT: Wake up, baby.
MIKE: Whu?
TRENT: Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
