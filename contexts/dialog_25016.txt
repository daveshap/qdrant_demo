PETER: I am old enough to--
MAY: --but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
PETER: I'll introduce you.

PETER: I'm a photographer, remember?

PETER: The record--
MAY: It'll shut itself off.
OCK: Ha. Anti-gravitational particles.
THORKEL: Power down. I need to talk to you.
OCK: Proof. Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.

OCK: I couldn't care less. What I've done is--

THORKEL: You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary. Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
OCK: I don't care. Cretin.
