SKINNER: Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
MULDER: About what?
SKINNER: -- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
MULDER: She was with me.
SKINNER: You don't see what's going on here, do you? There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
MULDER: And they want to blame us?
SKINNER: Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
MULDER: But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
SKINNER: -- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
MULDER: -- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
SKINNER: She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
MULDER: I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
SKINNER: Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
