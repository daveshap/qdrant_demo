I'd like to hear about positive PhD experiences for a change
I'm heavily considering applying to doctoral programs in the fall, and while I'm serious about it, the fact that I just keep hearing nothing but tales of misery and depression from people I know in real life and on Reddit makes me wonder what's in store for me. On this subreddit especially I've seen a lot of "I wouldn't do it again if I had the chance" and regrets over pursuing a PhD

For those of you that went through (or are currently in) a PhD program and enjoyed it, I'd love to hear from you, regardless of your field of study

Edit: For anyone curious, I plan on pursuing a PhD in Organizational/Industrial Psychology
