What is a free alternative for Adobe Acrobat Reader DC?
Hello everyone! You all were so helpful in recommending a free program for tracking my citations (Zotero), so I am coming to you again looking for another free resource. I've been using (and paying for) Adobe Acrobat Reader Pro DC to comment, highlight, and create bookmarks for TONS of PDF documents that I use for my graduate studies. However, looking at my bank account... It just doesn't seem worth $15 each month. It really adds up. I am wondering if folks have a free alternative? I'd like something with the Acrobat perks (like the ability to edit) but I also know beggars can't be choosers!
