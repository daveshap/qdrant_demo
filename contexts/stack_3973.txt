Why is correlation formula the way it is? Or Say how it formed? I am really being confused by why the correlation formula is called the correlation of two variables $X$ and $Y$. Also how is it derived? The part where we divide covariance by product of standard derivation of $X$ and standard derivation of $Y$ is the most confusing for me. Please explain the reasons or provide some good source for such things.
