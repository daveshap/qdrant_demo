My friend got 9/12 rejections (Ivy and state schools) BUT....
...I just got news he got signed to a major league team for \[X\] million dollars. **\[X\]. Million. Dollars.** At 18 years old.

A month ago, this man was literally so depressed after getting rejected from everywhere but 3 schools and went through the typical mindset of "no colleges wants me so I must be a failure and I'm going to get no job in the future because I'm not going to a good college..." but now homie is thriving. He told me that maybe getting rejected by all those Ivy Leagues and UC/other state schools was for the best, because it led him here :)

Don't mean for this to be deep really, but there are tons of kids who get that fat "We regret to inform you" letter and still find a way to make things work out! If March didn't go the way you wanted, keep your chin up because, hey, maybe things happen for a reason  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Edit: had to edit out the amount of money to keep his identity a "secret" but I guess its not that hard to find out if you're so intent on it....
