MRS. BAKER: It went well tonight.
JACK: Frank works hard.
MRS. BAKER: And you don't?
JACK: He leads, I follow.
MRS. BAKER: Is that the way it is?
JACK: Pretty much.
MRS. BAKER: He mentioned you had a girl for a while. A singer.
JACK: For a while. She left.
MRS. BAKER: Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
JACK: I suppose.
