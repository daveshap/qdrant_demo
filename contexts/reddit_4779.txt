I hate Facebook.
It makes me feel like crap. Every photo of parties that I am left out of is a like a sucker punch to the stomach. Even though I know if I were invited, I would probably have to decline because of kids anyway. 
But it would be nice to know at least I mattered enough to be invited. Guess all these people are not my friends after all. And that just makes me feel even worse. That I have no real friends.

Fuck you, Facebook.
