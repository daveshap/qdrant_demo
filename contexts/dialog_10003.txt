JULIA: I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
JOHN: Sounds good.
JULIA: I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
JOHN: Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
JULIA: I'm sure everything'll work out. She really loves you...
JOHN: So how are things at the hospital?
JULIA: Fine. You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
JOHN: No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
JULIA: Close.
JOHN: So how'd you like LION KING?
JULIA: Oh, I loved it. I wish you'd gone.
JOHN: I know. I'm sorry. Work.
JULIA: You work too hard, John.
JOHN: Look who's talking.
