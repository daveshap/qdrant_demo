Can lack of sleep increase how depressed you are?
Hey guys. So the last 3 months I’ve been pretty depressed and I really have no reason to be. I could have anything I ever wanted, but I picked up a new habit which is riding horses and every morning I have to be out there at 7 which I get isn’t bad.
This horse used to bring me joy, but now I’m only getting 4 hours of sleep per night, could that be making me more depressed.
