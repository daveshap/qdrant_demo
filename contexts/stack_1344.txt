Are pipe unions made to a standard size / threading? Are pipe unions in a given trade size (1/2, 3/4, etc.) generally compatible?e.g. if you get a new 'half union' with the physical characteristics generally mate up with a pre-existing opposite-side half union from another manufacturer? (To make this more general - I guess I mean within a given country or other area where plumbing standards are consistent. I wouldn't suppose threaded items from, say, the EU would fit things from the US...)Note - I'm not asking about how the union mates with the pipe itself, be it threaded, sweat, etc. Just how the union halves attach to each other.
