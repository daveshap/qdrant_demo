BOYD: Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
ADAM: You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
BOYD: We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
ADAM: What about the blood?
BOYD: Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
ADAM: Have you ever done this before?
BOYD: The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
