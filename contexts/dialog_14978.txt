GERTA: So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
JUNO: I'm a junior.
GERTA: No, I mean in your pregnancy.
JUNO: Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
VANESSA: Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
JUNO: Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
VANESSA: The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
JUNO: Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
VANESSA: I think pregnancy is beautiful.
JUNO: Well, you're lucky it's not you.
MARK: So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
JUNO: Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
