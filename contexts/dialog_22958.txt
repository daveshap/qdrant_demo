ALEX: Hey, Brenda.
BRENDA: Do I know you?
ALEX: Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, I'm sorry
CINDY: We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
BRENDA: Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
CINDY: Actually, I just met her. This is Alex.
BRENDA: Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
CINDY: Really? That's amazing.
BRENDA: Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
CINDY: Thanks.
BRENDA: You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today. Hey, what class do we have next?
CINDY: Psychology.
ALEX: Me, too. 101?
BRENDA: In room 302" at ten o'clock?"
ALEX: That's it.
BRENDA: Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
