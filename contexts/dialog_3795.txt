KAREN: Why do you hunt them?
WHISTLER: Habit, mostly, just like this.
WHISTLER: I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening --
KAREN: He killed them?
WHISTLER: Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
KAREN: How did you escape?
WHISTLER: I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live. Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
KAREN: And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
WHISTLER: Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
WHISTLER: I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
KAREN: I'll take my chances.
