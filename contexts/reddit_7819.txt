How do I get good at/comfortable with reading literature?
Please be nice, I already feel kind of stupid about this.
I find reading literature to be incredibly intimidating. I took an advanced grad class when I wasn't an advanced grad and the whole class was basically reading and discussing papers. I was very, very inexperienced at that point. Everyone had really insightful points of discussion while I struggled at basic comprehension. And it made me feel really stupid and incredibly intimidated towards reading papers. 
That has carried on to now. I want to be up do date or remotely close to that in my field of work now, and I intend to use this work from home time to do that. 
However, instead of just sifting through it directionless, I wish to have a strategy.
Just wanted to know if you guys have tips regarding the same. Where to start, how to start, how you might have understood data you weren't able to interpret initially.
Also-hope everyone is taking care of themselves in these stressful times. I'm sending out good vibes, this sub is full of such hard workers! :)
