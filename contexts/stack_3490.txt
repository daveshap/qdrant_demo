Collision-free cryptographic hashing? I wish to hash something that outputs a collision-free hash, and to use that hash as an id in a database. Using conventional cryptographic hashing (fixed-length) means there is a chance of collision, and that the id might not become unique.Does such a cryptographic hash exist?I guess I could always use deterministic asymmetric encryption and encrypt something with the public key, throw away the private key, and use the output as a sort of hash, but anyhow -- was wondering if there are other possibilities.Basically my problem is this -- I want each username to have a record in my database, but if someone gets a hold of my database, I don't want anyone be to able to read the username from a record. No user will ever know the username of someone else, thereby eliminating the possibility of simply hashing and testing if someone exists in the database.
