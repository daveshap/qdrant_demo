Weighing the Risks/Benefits of a New Job Opportunity
I'm currently in the interview process for a company that might be taken over by a much larger company later this year. If this smaller company does get taken over, is there a high chance my position might be terminated? I've never been through a company acquisition before, and I don't want to start a job only to get laid off. I also have no interest in working for that larger company if this smaller company does get taken over. My current manager came from that larger company and he has not said a single positive thing about it.
