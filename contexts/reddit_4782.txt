I feel anxious about going back to college
Winter break just ended and I have to go back today. I’ve been feeling down the whole last semester. I have one last semester left before I graduate. I feel empty inside and I feel like I haven’t done much fun stuff with college. 

I’m 22 and still a virgin/never been in a relationship (although I have been kissed but that was at a parties/clubs by strangers, and very rarely, so meaningless), and it’s eating me up, because I feel like no one wants me. The few girls who I got “close” with (and by close I mean talking) turned me down, and last semester I got friendzoned by the girl I liked. I have no clues how to date or how to initiate intimacy. All of my friends have had sex/dated and I feel so left out. I’ve lied to people about my lack of success just so I don’t get mocked.

I’ve been underweight most of my life too and no matter how hard I try I can’t seem to put on weight or bulk up. I’ve never been athletic and don’t have anything to show for that. I’m also not an interesting person, or had any interesting life experiences. I don’t have enough money to travel, and don’t really have any unique hobbies or skills. When I was in high school my parents were very strict and never let me go out, which I feel has socially stunted me. 

I don’t know if I’ll get a job after graduation (despite being in a decent field) and when I return home i feel like I’ll be stuck at there NEETing and working minimum wage jobs. Two of my closest friends have got jobs laid out after gradation.

I know when I graduate I’ll be miserable.
