MADOX: And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
CLIFTON: To arm-twisting.
MADOX: Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
CLIFTON: Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
KATHARINE: Darling, Peter says I could stay…
MADOX: Why not?
ALMÁSY: What kind of photographs?
CLIFTON: Portraits. The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
KATHARINE: Why do you think? About my staying?
CLIFTON: Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft…
KATHARINE: Oh.
CLIFTON: But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
ALMÁSY: Safe journey.
CLIFTON: You too. Good luck!
ALMÁSY: Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
CLIFTON: Appropriate?
ALMÁSY: I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
CLIFTON: Are you mad? Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
ALMÁSY: All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
CLIFTON: I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife. I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her. I think she's know herself.
ALMÁSY: Very well.
CLIFTON: Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
