GALVIN: Dr. Towler...
TOWLER: Yes.
GALVIN: You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
TOWLER: Yes, that's correct.
GALVIN: ...there are notations every thirty seconds...
TOWLER: Yes.
GALVIN: ...of the procedures...
TOWLER: Yes, the roving nurse...
GALVIN: But those notations stop... ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
TOWLER: We, we were rather busy...
GALVIN: Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped. And they resume seven minutes...
TOWLER: As I've said we had some more...
GALVIN: ...they start again three minutes earlier...
TOWLER: We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes. We were trying to restore her...
GALVIN: What happened in those three...
TOWLER: ...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
GALVIN: What happened in those three minutes...?
TOWLER: We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
GALVIN: Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
CONCANNON: Objection, we've...
GALVIN: ...to get her heartbeat back...?
CONCANNON: We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
GALVIN: ...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
CONCANNON: Your Honor...! Your Honor...
TOWLER: Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
GALVIN: Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
TOWLER: Yes.
GALVIN: Huh. And why is that?
TOWLER: Because she was anemic. It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
DR. THOMPSON: I didn't do too well for you.
GALVIN: No, you did fine.
DR. THOMPSON: I'm afraid that's not true. Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
GALVIN: No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
DR. THOMPSON: You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
GALVIN: Yes... I... yes.
DR. THOMPSON: You sure you don't want me to stay on.
GALVIN: No. No. Thank you. You go home.
