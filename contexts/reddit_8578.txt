What happens to the US debt repayment during a government shutdown?
In a government shutdown, [only essential services continue, like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid,](http://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-government-shutdowns)

Now, the national debt is owned by [roughly two entities:](https://money.cnn.com/2016/05/10/news/economy/us-debt-ownership/)

* U.S. citizens and American entities, such as state and local governments, pension funds, mutual funds, and the Federal Reserve.
* Foreign nations

So in the case of a shutdown,

1. Is repayment of the national debt and interest included in the essential services?

2. Are both, Foreign and Local entities, paid? Or just the Foreign ones?

3. In case no one is getting paid, will this lead to a crisis, or will the world just be like "It's the US, they'll just pay up when this resolved."
