What is probability of a user picking a published password? Say I have a large list (10 million) of published accounts and associated passwords.Assume this is a representative sample of population of account passwords.From this sample I can generate a distribution of passwords ordered from most used to least.There will likely be a password that is used more than any other and there will also be a large number of passwords used once (unique passwords).Say number of unique passwords is 50%.Can I therefore conclude that when a user invents a password that there is a 50% probability that they will pick a universally unique password?If not, what can I conclude?
