Watch out for a PM scammer asking people to purchase items from an amazon wishlist.
Hey everyone, just a heads up that we're receiving a flurry of reports about this in our modmail.  It doesn't get much lower than trying to suck money out of a community like ours with a sob story.   

We thank all the good citizens who've let us know, and we have reached out to the admins about this person.  But please be aware that we as community moderators can't see or police PMs.  It will help a lot if everyone who received a PM of this nature reports it directly to the admins, either by using the report function within the PM itself, or by using [reddit.com/report](https://www.reddit.com/report).  

Also, just in case it doesn't go without saying, do not spend any money for this individual.  The last thing we'd want is for them to get the idea that SW is good victim-hunting territory.
