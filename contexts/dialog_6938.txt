MISS CALLAHAN: It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
ALICE: How?
MISS CALLAHAN: Once the emptiness in Amy's life is filled, the dream will go of itself. If a up to you, both of you. Only you two can bring her into a real world.. You must give her the friendship and love she craves.
OLIVER: But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
MISS CALLAHAN: Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
