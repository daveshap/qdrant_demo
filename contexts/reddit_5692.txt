Been Job searching for two months... running out of hope
&#x200B;

So I need to preface this story a little. I worked for a startup in the SF Bay Area as a Business Onboarding Specialist for about 7 months and some change before being laid off in September of 2019 ( We went through a messy acquisition and a large portion of the company ended up getting laid off :/ ). Shortly afterward I took some time off to travel and in October I took a contract position that lasted until December. Since then I've been feeling a little hopeless. Most of my experience in my work career has been as an Account Manager for a real estate company. I apply to a minimum of 20 jobs a day, most are startups. It's currently the middle of February and I am going crazy due to not working. I have some saved as well as unemployment so I don't need to find a job right away. That being said it's incredibly demoralizing to watch my bank account slowly drain every month. I've been using this time to work on skills ( I've learned SQL, some Python, as well as some inbound marketing skills. I've also been taking classes to finish my bachelor's degree as well) during this time in hopes of finding ways to make myself more marketable. I understand it's still early in the year so I may be overacting but my apartment lease is also up at the end of May and I do need to have money saved to move and at this right, I won't have enough since I've been paying the rent with my savings. If anyone has any leads on any sales or operations roles for any startups in the SF Bay Area I would greatly appreciate it. Feel free to DM and I can shoot over my resume and my Linkedin as well. Also, I would love to hear stories on how you guys have mentally survived to be unemployed.
