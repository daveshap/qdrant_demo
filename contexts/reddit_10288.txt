I almost died yesterday
I almost did it yesterday. I skipped school and went into the woods with some alcohol and a rope and I planned to end my life. I tied the noose and I jumped from a tree. Miraculously my neck didn’t break and and a homeless man came out of nowhere and cut me down. In that second that I was hanging from the tree all I could think about was how much of a mistake it was. I spent the rest of that day talking with the homeless man and learning about his experiences and I realized that life has its ups and downs but that’s what life is, you gotta live through the pain because it’s all experiences, not good or bad experiences, just experiences. Thank you, Mike, if you are reading this.
