Might be getting fired..in a month or sooner. How I do deal with the issue in the present and prepare for the future..
So, my job has been going decently as far as my performance. Expect I made one small mistake that has potentially escalated into a bad chain of events. Like it was because I was clumsy..and was rushing to fix said issue which didn’t help fix it.

Won’t go into further details on here. So my manager sat me down and was like so explain your mistake. Which I had multiple times at this point..and retold my story. This leads up to higher ups apparently scrutinizing things ‘better’ now..and how said mistake was being looked into.

Which leads up to, my job isn’t in danger right now but if said issue escalates it could be grounds for termination. I have worked at this place for a year, haven’t had any serious violations, get along with my coworkers, don’t slack etc..

But now this is dropped in my lap and it sucks

So any advice on how to NOT walk on eggshells like I am not going to be ( possibly) gainfully unemployed  within a month. Any rock bottom to recovery stories.

How do I not panic about this..help.
