A circuit to convert 4-bit Gray numbers to BCD I'm sorry for asking this specific question here but can some one please tell me what's wrong with this solution.Question: design a circuit to convert 4bit Gray numbers to BCD I have to say I wrote numbers in Gray form in the left hand side of the truth table.Let's consider a number such 1000 in Gray My solution:It's binary equivalent is 1111 and we cannot show that in BCD so output have to be don't careHere is what my professor says:Binary equivalent: 1111Decimal equivalent: 15BCD equivalent:00010101I'm completely confused :| Edit:As some users noted I wrote grey codes in non sequential order.But the answer of karnaugh map will remain same. To see this you can compare the link @Jack Creasey added as comment and my karnaugh maps.(also note I just designed this circuit with decoder)
