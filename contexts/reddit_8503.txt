What does the Mars Authorization Bill do to help NASA's efforts for a manned mission to Mars?
President Donald Trump [signed a bill](http://time.com/4708394/donald-trump-nasa-mars-exploration-bill/) into law Tuesday that updates NASA's mission to add exploration of Mars and authorizes $19.5 billion in spending for the U.S. space agency for the current budget year.

However, critics of the bill, namely [Elon Musk](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/22/elon-musk-slams-donald-trumps-nasa-bill-saying-it-does-nothing-to-help-mission-to-mars.html), have suggested that "This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing."

What does this bill truly achieve for NASA and Mars exploration?
