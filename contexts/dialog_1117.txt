BERNSTEIN: Woodward?
WOODWARD: Hmm?
BERNSTEIN: What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
WOODWARD: Only everything...
SIMONS: More denunciations?
ROSENFELD: One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
SIMONS: What's this?
BRADLEE: My non-denial denial.
