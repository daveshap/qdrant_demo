Do you tolerate raised voices or yelling?
This is a throwaway. I am a seasoned programmer with 15+ years of experience in the tech industry. I recently took a job at a small startup and one of the company founders routinely likes to raise his voice or just yell when he is unhappy with a person and lately some of this has been directed at myself. I have never in my entire career came across this behavior and I don't even know how to process it.  


Is this a red line for you and would you just quit on the spot or how have you handled this in the past if it has happened to you?
