Reapplying for a job I was rejected to last year
Last year, I went through 3 interviews for this organization, provided references etc etc, was told that I was one of the top two candidates only to receive a phone call in the end and be told that the offer was given to someone else. The woman I spoke with was apologetic, said she was upset with the decision herself, and told me that she would keep my resume on file. I was upset and figured all of these comments were fillers and just said thank you and moved on. 

They recently posted a job similar to the one from last year. I'm going to reapply and submit my updated resume and cover letter and I'm wondering would it be unprofessional or too eager to reach out to the woman I was corresponding with last year to let her know that I am reapplying for the position so she remembers who I am? She still works with the organization so I'm not worried about my email bouncing.

Also, if anyone has been through a similar situation, would you mind sharing what your experience was like?
