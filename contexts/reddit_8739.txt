What are the benefits and drawbacks of capping CEO salaries?
Recently, a study was released that found that [CEO's make, on average, 339 times more than the median worker in their company.](https://ellison.house.gov/sites/ellison.house.gov/files/Rewarding%20Or%20Hoarding%20Full%20Report.pdf)

This sparked a few questions in my head.

1. Can we constitutionally introduce federal laws capping how much more CEO's can make than their employees? For example, a law that says CEO's can only make 10x or 50x more than the lowest earning employee? 

2. If we can, what are the possible drawbacks and benefits of this?

I'd also like to open this discussion up to the effects such a law or rule would have on the economy, if anyone's interested.
