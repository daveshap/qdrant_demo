Are we allowed to celebrate goals here? My credit JUST bumped from poor to average after years of work!
Considering my credit was in the absolute tank about 5 years ago, having average credit feels like such a milestone. I grew up really poor and have always had terrible budgeting techniques (a learned trait, from my lovely fiscally irresponsible parents). 

Hereâ€™s to breaking tradition! Thanks for letting me brag a little bit. 

edit: you guys are amazing, thank you so much for all the support! I am feeling kind of on top of the world today from all the love.
