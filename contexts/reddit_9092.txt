Did the Clinton Campaign Break Campaign Finance Law?
The Sanders Campaign has posted a [public letter](https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Bernie-2016-Letter-to-DNC-1.pdf) to DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz citing their belief that the Hillary Victory Fund violated the FEC.

> The Hillary Victory Fund has reported receiving several individual contributions in amounts as high as $354,400 or more, which is over 130 times the $2,700 limit that applies for contributions to Secretary Clinton's campaign. Bernie 2016 is particularly concerned that these extremely large-dollar individual contributions have been used by the Hillary Victory Fund to pay for more than $7.8 million in direct mail efforts and over $8.6 million in online advertising, both of which appear to benefit only HFA by generating low-dollar contributions that flow only to HFA, rather than to the DNC or any of the participating state party committees.

Here is a [Financial Summary of the Hillary Victory Fund] (http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandidateCommitteeDetail.do?candidateCommitteeId=C00586537&tabIndex=1) via the FEC. 

**Is the Sanders Campaign's allegations that the Clinton Campaign broke Campaign Finance Law true?**
