PAT: Dick, you should call Bobby.
NIXON: He doesn't want me at the funeral.
PAT: You don't have to go.
NIXON: De Gaulle's gonna be there. And Macmillan. And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
PAT: Then call him. I'm sure it was an oversight.
NIXON: No. It's his way. He hates me. Him and Teddy. They always hated me.
PAT: They've lost a brother. You know what that means, Dick.
