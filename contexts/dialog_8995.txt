CASTOR: Where's Jamie?
EVE: That's what I'd like to know. She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
CASTOR: I'll deal with her later.
EVE: Good. Because I'm fed up.
EVE: I'm going to the powder room.
CASTOR: Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want. But I have to give you an escort. Security reasons.
