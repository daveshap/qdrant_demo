I got a 4.0 this whole year. How I did it.
I'm a college freshman btw.

\#1: You have to know how to say NO. It is never a bad thing to have some fun while you're in college; you need to have those times where you can laugh and have a good time. However, you should not be partying and socializing 24/7. If you know you have an exam the next day that you need to study for, don't go out partying the night before. If you know you have that big essay due in a two days, don't go out and leave it until the last minute. Learn to prioritize.

\#2: You have to study. This is a given, but I feel like many students do not take this seriously. During this school year, I took some difficult courses such as Anatomy & Physiology and Chemistry. Studying for 2-3 hours a week was not going to do me any good when there was so much material to cover. Take your studies seriously and study the material you need to learn. Removing distractions (phone, TV, etc) helped me focus on my studies as well.

\#3: Interact your teachers. Take advantage of those office hours. Math was never my strong suit, so when I found out I had an 89.5% in college algebra, I was highly disappointed because I put in a lot of effort into that course. My college algebra professor and I had a good relationship, so when I talked to him about this, he gave me an easy assignment for extra credit that boosted my grade up to an A.

\#4: Stay FAR AWAY from the drama and mind your own business. Drama always ends up making people feel down and more stressed than they already are. I know this one girl who had two boyfriends at once. The boyfriends ended up finding out, and made the girl's life a living hell, causing her to fall behind in her studies. This could all could have easily been avoided.

&#x200B;

\#5: Become aware of how you learn and retain information. For example, I love recording my professors' lectures and listening to them afterward. While listening to the recordings, I write and fill in my notes that I took during the lecture just in case I missed anything. This helps me retain a lot of information and perform well on tests because professors tend to say exactly what will be on tests during their lectures.

\#6 USE RATEMYPROFESSOR before you choose any teacher! This is a life saver! Bad teachers exist, and they should be avoided.
