HAROLD: Yes.
MAUDE: Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end - - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
HAROLD: Yes.
MAUDE: Well, it's a new experience for me. Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
HAROLD: But this is my car.
MAUDE: Your hearse?
HAROLD: Yearse!
MAUDE: Oh.
