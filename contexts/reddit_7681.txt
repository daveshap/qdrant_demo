Tips for teaching my first class?
I recently accepted admission into a Master of Education program in Higher Education Student Affairs. I'm super excited about it, and part of my GAship involves co-instructing a freshman class that's basically meant to teach them how to acclimate and succeed in college (go to class, manage time, utilize campus resources, etc).

Also, phone disclaimer. Sorry.

Anyway, while I do have a year of instructional experience, it's at a high school, and with very small groups. I'm guessing the class size is going to be 25-30ish students, whereas I currently have a maximum of 8 students at a time. I feel confident in my ability to get through course materials and lecture, but my current role is much more scripted than I'm imagining this to be. I didn't write the syllabus for the course I instruct at the high school, but I'll be writing it with my co-instructor for the college course.

I'm not agonizing over content because I have my teaching materials. I know what will be covered.

The advice I'm looking for is more stylistic. What can I do to make class enjoyable, and feel like more than a lecture? How can I make students feel involved in this course in a meaningful way? One idea I have is taking students out into the town so they can get to know the community better.

Also, this actually does make me nervous: I was never a college freshman in the sense that many of them will be. I started at a community college at 20 and transferred, and I'm assuming they'll be more traditional freshmen who live in dorms and are right out of high school. What was that like, for those of you who did that? How can I help align my course to an experience I didn't have?

Generic and general advice is also greatly appreciated. Thanks, everyone.
