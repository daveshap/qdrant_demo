HAMMOND: Hey, how'd my car get here?
CATES: I had it impounded. Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
HAMMOND: Back to jail in my own car. Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
CATES: I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one. It'll be my good-bye present.
HAMMOND: Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
CATES: Naw, you didn't let me down. It was a long shot all the way. We gave 'em a good run at it.
HAMMOND: Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
HAMMOND: It's late, they're closing...
CATES: Don't worry about it.
ELAINE: Hey, I don't believe it.
CATES: Hiya, kid.
ELAINE: I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
CATES: Don't. We've had a hard night.
ELAINE: I can see that. Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit. What happened?
CATES: We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
ELAINE: Who the hell are you?
HAMMOND: Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
ELAINE: I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
HAMMOND: Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years. And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
ELAINE: Shrink major, not a shrink.
