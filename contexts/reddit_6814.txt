Response to Recruiter Email
I got an email yesterday from a recruiter at a company I applied to at the end of August; the position is entry level and requires 3 years of experience in addition to a bachelor's degree. What should I say in the reply? I'm assuming that the email was sent in response to my application (albeit a few weeks after the fact) so it's likely they know I don't have the experience, but I'm not sure of what to say.
