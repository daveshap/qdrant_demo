CREATURE: Come warm yourself if you like.
VICTOR: You speak.
CREATURE: Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man. I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
VICTOR: How did you find me?
CREATURE: The letters in your journal. That and a geography book. Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
VICTOR: Kill me and have done with it.
CREATURE: Kill you? Hardly that.
VICTOR: Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
CREATURE: More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me? What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice. Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
VICTOR: Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
CREATURE: Your crime... as well as mine.
VICTOR: How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
CREATURE: Evil? Do you believe in evil?
VICTOR: I see it before me.
CREATURE: I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
