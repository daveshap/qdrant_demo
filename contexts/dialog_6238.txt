MAX: Hi ya' doin'? Where to?
ANNIE: Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
MAX: I'll take Sixth. It's faster.
ANNIE: What?
MAX: Sixth is faster.
ANNIE: Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
MAX: The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
ANNIE: Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
MAX: First Friday of the month? Linens. Roll right off the trucks. They're in and out in twenty minutes... ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago. Traffic will be smooth.
MAX: But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
ANNIE: We taking bets? What if you're wrong?
MAX: The ride is free.
ANNIE: You got a deal.
ANNIE: Go ahead, say it.
MAX: No. I got lucky with the lights.
ANNIE: No. You were right, I was wrong... ...Max.
