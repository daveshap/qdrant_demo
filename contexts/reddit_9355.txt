Half Christmas heads up for easy houseplant gift
It was halfway to Christmas this past week. If you had a hard time thinking of low cost gift ideas and have a bit of time this summer, this is the perfect time to get some cuttings off a houseplant or succulents (either your own or if you have a friend or relative with big healthy plants see if they will share). A cute little cactus or pothos or similar grown in a pretty coffee mug (50 cents to a dollar at thrift shops) on a sunny windowsill could be a nice gift for a coworker or plant obsessed friend this Christmas.
