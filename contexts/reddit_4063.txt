How do you meet girls in your early 20s?
So I (M20) have never dated, or even kissed a girl. I graduated from school about 2 years ago and have been serving my mandatory service in the army for the past year. When I'm done in January, I will apply for pilot school. 

However, I'm feeling that my life is a bit empty. There are no intimacy, and in general I feel a bit lonely. I have very few friends that I actually hang with and they all study so I mostly sit alone. When we actually got time, we only play video games and honestly, I could use some changes in my life.

I want to start dating, get some experience there and see if that could fill a bit of the empty space in me. Only thing is that as I said, I have no experience with girls at all. I dont interact with many girls regularily and honestly, I think dating apps wpuld be my most viable option.
However, I'm not very photogenic, so getting pics I'm satisfied with will be a challange :P Dont get me wrong though, I do think I am an above average looking dude.

Anyway, Im looking for other suggestions as well as tips and ideas about what I can do! Anything would be great! :)
