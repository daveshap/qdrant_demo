A close friend of mine wants me to 'get my act together' before he dates me.
I'm not sure if I'm being illogical, so I wanted to ask the people of /r/whatsbotheringyou for advice.

Firstly, I'm a 21 year old college senior majoring in Psych. The first 3 years of my college career went quite well- I worked in two research labs, got a grant to do my own research, joined the McNair Scholars program, started an honors thesis, and a worked towards a bunch of other academic pursuits. It was stressful, but I was lucky enough to not need to work, so I could devote all of my time to my studies.  However, I burned myself out and got depressed towards the start of my third year in college. I ended up withdrawing from 2 semesters of classes, and I watched my dreams of going straight from my B.S. to a PhD program deteriorate. I'm doing far better now, but I still have a lot to work on. 


I have to pass the quantitative section of my GRE and get my apartment in order. (My depression pretty much confined me to my room, and the rest of my apt suffered for it). I also gained about 20 pounds due to eating takeout all the time. 


I have a close friend who has expressed a bit of interest in dating me, but I'm starting to get frustrated at the conditions he's decided to place. He told me that before we start any type of relationship he 'wants to see me get my act together'. He wants me to lose the 20 pounds, get my apartment in order, get  into a Master's program, and start wearing make-up again. I feel like he should be more patient- studying for the GRE is taking up most of my day, and I don't want to get involved in so many things that I fall apart again. 

His life isn't completely together, hell, he dropped out of college. I don't expect him to change anything. Is it wrong of me to feel like he only wants to date me if I'm perfect?
