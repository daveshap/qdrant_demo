Here are my results from 51 colleges. AMA.
If you haven't already, check out this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bedpew/14_rapplyingtocollege_friends_and_i_applied_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). I am the outlier. I applied to a total of 51 colleges with fee waivers. It was technically 52 colleges because I did apply to a nearby state university. However, I never completed my application because I never submitted the additional info they asked for. I don't count that one since I have never gotten my decision from that institution. I used the Common Application, the Questbridge Application, and the Gopher Application for the University of Minnesota.

**Questbridge College Match:**

I found out about Questbridge the summer before my senior year. I somehow managed to ask for recommendation letters two weeks before the deadline because of a late school start. I learned so much about myself through the Questbridge process. There are so many little things about me that I have never realized before. I ranked 12 schools for the Questbridge College Match, and I was not matched to any of them. I later switched to ED I for the University of Pennsylvania and ED II for Tufts University. I got rejected from both.

&#x200B;

**Regular Decision:**

I finalized my regular decision a few days after I got my rejection from the University of Pennsylvania. I applied to nearly every QB partner because I assumed they have good financial aid on top of my Common App ones.

&#x200B;

**How I organized:**

I am a google drive folder nerd. I created a [google drive folder](https://imgur.com/gy50uEa) for my college application stuff. Inside this **Whole Bunch of Schools** folder, I have six individual folders: **Scholarships**, **Regular Decision Schools**, **Questbridge**, **LORs**, **Common App**, and **College lists** [screenshot](https://imgur.com/Dp5ygSX).

There is a **Submitted** folder inside the **Scholarship** so I could keep track of what scholarships I have applied to [screenshot](https://imgur.com/D63DDjZ).

There are four folders inside the **Regular Decision Schools**: **QB**, **Own**, **Common App**, and **College Match** [screenshot](https://imgur.com/4C84Jjq). The number next to the folder name indicates how many schools I applied were in that category. All the numbers added up to 51. Let’s take a peek inside. I have two folders inside **QB** named **1** and **2** [screenshot](https://imgur.com/rHgdf9l). **1** is all January 1st deadline schools [screenshot](https://imgur.com/NMDdLad). **2** is all January 15th or after. It is important to organize them so you know what supplement you should be working on to make sure you turn everything in by the deadline. **Own** only has one school [screenshot again](https://imgur.com/6nNxpgw). I used the same 1,2 method for my **Common App** folder. **College Match** has all my Questbridge Match schools.

**Questbridge** has all my Questbridge essays.

**LORs** is all about recommendation letters. I created a brag sheet for all my teachers. I also have my **LOCI** (Letter of Continued Interest) folder in here.

**Common App** is full of common app essay ideas. I wrote three essays for my Common App, but I ended up using my Questbridge biographical essay for Common App.

**College Lists**, like the name suggests, is full of college lists. I have my regular decision list, Questbridge match list, and lists of colleges with stats in here.

The rest of my college folder is unorganized. It has my interview questions and dates, thank you emails, working schedule, official test score list, mid-year report list, major plan, activities list, financial aid deadline spreadsheet, and FA submission sheet.

&#x200B;

**Financial Aid:**

I included two dates for every school on my [regular decision list](https://imgur.com/bRKFgg7). All schools were color coded. Red for Questbridge regular decision, blue for Common App regular decision, green for Questbridge College Match, and yellow for own application (not included in the screenshot because it is at the very bottom of the document). You might wonder what those dates were. The first date was the application deadline. The second date was the financial aid deadline. This document was very useful to me when I tried to track every deadline. I would highlight the date after I submitted my application or financial documents. I have a [FA submission document](https://imgur.com/vh2QMxQ). I color coded this document as well. As you can see, I submitted my FAFSA in waves because FAFSA only allows you to submit 10 schools at a time. If you need financial aid, make sure you give yourself enough time to submit them by the deadline. The same rule applies for CSS Profile. I also created a [financial aid deadline spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/Iz894np). I know it looks confusing to you. It basically has all the deadlines and just some random things I need to remind myself of. Do not ever feel like you have to use a spreadsheet. I really like my google doc, and I think it worked better for me than a spreadsheet. You can use whatever tool you want to keep track of all your deadlines.

# If you are asking for a lot of financial aid, make sure you check to see if the school is need-blind. This was one of my biggest mistakes I made during the application process. I assumed that 100% need met schools are all need-blind. I was WRONG. There was no surprise when I got rejected by all need-aware schools that meet 100% need.

&#x200B;

**Waiting process and Interviews:**

Waiting was the hardest. I had no clue what was about to happen. One advice I can give on this topic is to really love your safety school. Make sure you applied to somewhere you would not mind attending. My safety was the University of Minnesota and that was my first acceptance. My financial aid package was not good. My in-state safety turned out to be my most expensive one, which is kind of ironic. I could certainly make it work, but it would be a struggle after getting multiple school-specific scholarship rejections. I looked at the dorms. I calculated the cost and where I could get money to cover everything. I would say that I was pretty settled with the University of Minnesota. I knew I would be going to college, and I knew that the University of Minnesota would not be a bad choice for me.

I know one thing about applying to so many colleges is that I would receive more rejections. There was a time where I got 10+ rejections in a day. I had sad tears. I had happy tears. I would never forget those moments when I opened up my decision letter and it said “Congratulations!”

Let’s talk about interviews. I had nine interviews in total. I did interviews for Brown, Grinnell, Hamilton, Haverford, Oberlin, Wellesley, Stanford, Columbia, and Princeton. Interviews are simply conversations. Interviewers want to know more about you. I think it would be helpful to find some interview questions online and practice them ahead of time. One of the most common questions is “tell me about yourself”. This question is hard because you don't know what to start. Make sure you have your activity sheet somewhere near you because you might forget about everything during the interview. Trust me. It happens. I did all my interviews on Skype except for Princeton so I could not comment much on how you should dress for an interview. I did one of my interviews in pajamas. Enough said.

&#x200B;

**Scholarships**:

I did get a few very generous local scholarships. I will suggest you apply to as many local scholarships as you possibly can. There is less competition and the amount is usually pretty good. If you get admitted to any college, please make sure you check their financial aid policy on outside scholarships. Some colleges allow you to keep the extra money if the total amount of scholarships exceeds the cost of attendance. Some colleges don't let you go beyond their cost of attendance and will reduce aid accordingly. Most schools will reduce loans and work-study before they reduce their grant. In this case, please look at your financial package to see how much money you would need to cover the cost of attendance. You should apply to local scholarships, however, you should stop applying for more once you have reached your money goal and the cost of attendance is covered. You will not be able to keep the extra money anyway, might as well leave it for someone else who needs it the most.

&#x200B;

**Final Note:**

Please keep in mind that the college process is completely random. I can not tell you whether or not you should shotgun schools, but I hope this post helps some juniors who are thinking about applying to a large number of colleges. If you do end up applying to a lot of schools, please make sure you double check your supplements before you submit them. It is common to recycle essays, but you have to make sure you do not put the wrong college name. You should take the time to write each supplement. Every school is different so you really have to do your research. I started submitting essays three days before the deadline because I knew I needed extra time to double check everything. You do not want to make silly mistakes after all that effort you have put into this process. Do not afraid to dream big. The college process is overwhelming and we all know that every year it is only getting worse. The result doesn't define who we are and what amazing things we are able to do in our lives. You can learn at just about everywhere.

&#x200B;

So this is it. This is my college process. I will be the first person in my family to graduate from high school and to attend college.
