Overcoming qualification deficits?
Hey everyone, I’m a recent college graduate of two months and I’ve been applying for Finance jobs over the past five months or so and haven’t had a single bite yet. Tons of sales jobs are hiring, but they’re the “make up to $100,000 your first year!!!” type of jobs, until you go and read their Glassdoor page which says “you’re going to struggle your first year for sure.” For now, I’m just looking for stable compensation. 

There are a lot of qualifications I know I don’t have, namely 3-5 years working experience for an entry level job. I have never worked in Finance. Other qualifications I don’t possess are the numerous programs they use that I haven’t been exposed to yet due to not working in Finance, with the exception of Excel which I am extremely good at.

I’m struggling to break into the job market. How can I make myself more appealing and overcome the obvious issues with my experience? If I can’t, can I fall back on something else?
