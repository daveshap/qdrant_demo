Do I have to go to a good school for finance?
I don’t want to be in such a competitive job like investment banking and hedge fund, I would just like to have a career after having worked at entry level jobs for a while, 9 to 5, paying around 100k to 150k for a while and when I have so much experience, move up to a higher position. 

Has anyone gone to a regular university like U of H and has made a good living off of it? I plan to do other businesses and invest in real estate too. 

I’m just feeling a little let down since I’m only in the 22% at my high school. I have 2 years left.
