FRANK: ... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
JESSE: Don't care.
FRANK: Didn't think you would. I'm going to go make the coffin.
JESSE: Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
COLE: Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
BOB: The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
COLE: I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
JIM: I like that.
JESSE: No.
JESSE: This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
COLE: So what do we do, General Lee?
JESSE: Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
BOB: But if we take their money and supplies...
JESSE: Exactly.
