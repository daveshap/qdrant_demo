Communicating between 2 different microcontrollers My Arduino runs at 16MHz clock speed; another microcontroller runs at clock speed of 13MHz. If I send digital output directly from an output pin of the former to input pin of the latter, there will be a loss of data and the transmission will be corrupted. Question 1: How do I get the MCUs to properly transmit the data without any corruption? Do I need to sync them somehow, or I should use another device in middle as some kind of a buffer (or maybe to send data at a lower rate)?Question 2: If I can send data at a lower rate from MCU#1 to MCU#2 will there be a phasing difference which would result in data corruption?
