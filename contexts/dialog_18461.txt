HALLOR: You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW: Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
HALLOR: Now wait a minute, buddyâ€”
LONGFELLOW: There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
HALLOR: No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds. You know, we've got letters.
LONGFELLOW: Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
BUTLER: Yes, sir.
