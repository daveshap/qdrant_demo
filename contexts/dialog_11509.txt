SUZETTE: Madam should sleep.
GRUSINSKAYA: I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
SUZETTE: When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
GRUSINSKAYA: In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses. Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
SUZETTE: Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
GRUSINSKAYA: Goodnight, Suzette.
