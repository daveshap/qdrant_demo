CATO: Catch!
KIT: What do you mean?
KIT: Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
HOLLY: No.
KIT: Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you. I'll try anything once. What's your name? I said mine.
HOLLY: Holly.
KIT: Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
HOLLY: What for?
KIT: Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
KIT: Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like druthers"
HOLLY: It's okay.
KIT: Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
HOLLY: You still in school?
KIT: Nah, I got me a job.
HOLLY: Doing what?
KIT: Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
HOLLY: That's my father. I got to run.
KIT: Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
HOLLY: Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
KIT: What?
HOLLY: Can I be honest?
KIT: Sure.
HOLLY: Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
KIT: He'll say that?
HOLLY: Yeah.
KIT: Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
HOLLY: Nothing.
KIT: There you go.
HOLLY: Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
