ALEX: Hello. You all right?
DAVID: I'm sorry I woke you up.
ALEX: Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
DAVID: No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
ALEX: That's easy enough.
DAVID: I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
ALEX: David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
DAVID: Will you come with me?
ALEX: What?
DAVID: I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
ALEX: Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
DAVID: Will you think about it?
ALEX: How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
DAVID: Not just a patient -- me.
ALEX: You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
DAVID: Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
ALEX: All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
DAVID: Now I'm embarrassed.
ALEX: Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
