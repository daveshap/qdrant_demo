WENDY: Talking to me, dad?
BEN: Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
WENDY: Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
BEN: I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
BEN: Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
WENDY: Huh?
BEN: I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
BEN: Your toes cold?
WENDY: Yeah.
