LITTLE BILL: Yeah?
SKINNY: Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
LITTLE BILL: Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
SKINNY: ...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
LITTLE BILL: An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
SKINNY: Yup.
LITTLE BILL: All week?
SKINNY: I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
LITTLE BILL: Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
SKINNY: Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.
LITTLE BILL: They really got all that money, them whores?
SKINNY: You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe.
LITTLE BILL: That much, huh?
SKINNY: You could run off them two cowboys.
LITTLE BILL: I could run off them whores.
SKINNY: Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
LITTLE BILL: Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
