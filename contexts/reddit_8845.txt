With regard to the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower complaint and the presidential impeachment process, from a legal/constitutional perspective, does the identity of the whistleblower matter, or only the whistleblower's assertions?
> [On 12 August 2019, an unnamed CIA officer filed a whistleblower complaint with Michael Atkinson, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG), under the provisions of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA). Atkinson looked into the complaint and interviewed several government officials whom the whistleblower identified as having information to substantiate his claims. On August 26, having found **the complaint to be both "credible" and "of urgent concern"** (as defined by the ICWPA), and noting the "subject matter expertise" of the whistleblower, Atkinson transmitted the complaint to Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal#Whistleblower_complaints)

> [In recent weeks Trump and his supporters have accused the author of the complaint of being a “deep-state operative.” However, both the inspector general for the intelligence community and the acting director of national intelligence have said the individual followed legal procedure.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whistleblower-protections-explained)

>[Since the beginning of whistleblowing in America, government whistleblowers who put their name and face on their revelations have not fared well, particularly those from the intelligence community. They are typically tarred in the media, often prosecuted and almost inevitably fired and blackballed from further government service. “So far as I’m aware, from [Daniel] Ellsberg to the present day, there hasn't been a single case in which a genuine whistleblower who exposed major problems in the intelligence community has experienced anything other than retaliation,” Patrick Eddington, a former CIA employee who revealed that his agency and the military were covering up U.S. soldiers’ exposure to toxins during the 1991 Iraq War, told me. Especially in an unstable, emotionally charged, politically polarized era like the one in which the current whistleblower is operating, government truth-tellers are all too easily vilified as traitors, deflecting attention from the problems they are attempting to reveal. ](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/26/whistleblower-identity-ukraine-history-of-retaliation-228324)
