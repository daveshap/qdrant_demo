ZAMMITO: She seems pleasant enough.
VINNY: She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
ZAMMITO: That's good. That's what a stand-up guy does.
ZAMMITO: So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
VINNY: You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
ZAMMITO: Yeah. I mean besides that. They treating you all right? Food okay?
VINNY: Yeah. I'm going home today. What do you want, Frankie?
ZAMMITO: I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
VINNY: A little?
ZAMMITO: Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
VINNY: You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
ZAMMITO: What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
