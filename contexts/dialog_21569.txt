SAM: Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
LILA: Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
SAM: It's been three.
LILA: Are we just going to go on sitting here?
SAM: He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
LILA: You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
SAM: Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
LILA: Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
SAM: I feel better when you feel better.
LILA: Where's the old highway?
SAM: You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
LILA: Yes.
SAM: That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
LILA: Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
SAM: Arbogast said...
LILA: An hour! Or less!
SAM: Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think.
LILA: Sam! Why call when we can go?
SAM: And maybe pass Arbogast on the road? Thanks.
SAM: Probably on his way back right now.
LILA: Sam, I'm going.
SAM: You'll never find it.
SAM: Stay here.
LILA: Why can't I go out there with you?
SAM: I don't know... One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
LILA: Just wait here?
SAM: Contemplate your... panic button.
