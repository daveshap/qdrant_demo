I feel sad
I'm 16 and I've moved into my new school (The UK education system is a little different). It's been almost 5 weeks now and I haven't made any actual friends. I didn't do anything over the summer, and I'd like to stress the fact that that is really not an exaggeration, I was lonely and bored for the whole long summer. I would have thought that things would have somehow changed, going back to school, but nothing really has. I have no friends and I have these super hard subjects to do and it's really worse than before. I think it has something to do with the fact that I hate myself and everyone is a lot taller than I am (I'm 5 ft 2 ins - i'm a guy). Everything is really bleak and I spend a lot of time in bed now, cuddling up to my pillow. Life has really sucked ever since the start of Summer.
