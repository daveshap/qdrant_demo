Will there be a negative impact on doctors and other healthcare providers once Obamacare is repealed?
If some 20 million people are now uninsured or in uninsured limbo until the GOP finds a new solution, and with healthcare in the US being ridiculously expensive out of pocket, will healthcare providers experience an abrupt halt in patients, especially those who are in specialized fields? What happens to doctors working in inner cities or more rural parts of the country? Or will repealing Obamacare not leave a big impact on the medical community?
