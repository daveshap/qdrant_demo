The bar is at the fooking FLOOR
I'm a below average/average dude, but I'm always shocked at how basic manners are seen as acts of kindness whenever I go on a date. 

I recently went on a date with a girl, and I told her she looked really good. She instantly lit up and said that she's NEVER had someone tell her that before on a date. I'm like wtf. Man that's a bit sad because I felt like she was a good-looking person and I thought it was a polite thing to say. 

On another occasion, I was watching Big Mouth with a date and there was a scene where this dude tries to push a girl's head towards his crouch, indicating that he wanted oral sex. She told me about how that's happened to her a few times on a date, and again, I'm like wtf; that's rude af. 

I don't know man. My ex girlfriend a couple of years told me that I was the only person who treated her right, but nothing about me is special--nor romantic.

Ultimately, I guess what I'm trying to say is that the bar is at the fooking FLOOR.
