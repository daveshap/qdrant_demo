Relay or optocoupler to switch thermostat wires I'm doing a project to replace my thermostat with a DIY one.I'm trying to figure out how to switch the heating/cooling/fan/humidity wires. I'm inclined to go with an optocoupler like the 4N35. It can switch 24VAC with ease, but has a low threshold for amps (150mA).Most older thermostats that I know, give the familiar clicking sound when heat is called, implying that they use a mechanical relay. But when looking to more modern thermostats, like the Nest or Ecobee, there is no clicking, either using an SSR or an OC.The problem is that I can't find anywhere any \"specs\" of what a thermostat should be able to switch. As the wiring is only 24-28 gauge wire it should never use more than 225mA - 580mA.Is my assumption correct? Should I opt for using relays or would a simple optocoupler do?
