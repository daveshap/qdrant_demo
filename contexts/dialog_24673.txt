AMY: When I freaked out at the pub? That was nothing, just nerves. Don’t worry about it.
KAT: But I do. I will. You’re my sister.
AMY: God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
KAT: What? Why? What do you mean?
AMY: I should get going.
KAT: Are you sure you’re okay?
AMY: I’m fine. I promise.
