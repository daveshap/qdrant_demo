How to speak and write smoothly and articulately in both English and Russian and become employable?
Hiyah. I'm 22 y/o Russian native guy. Just came back to Moscow after studying for 6 years in US Florida, and I kinda speak fluently both languages, but not really. Today I lost a Russian job offering on a really good position because my written test assignment had too many mistakes in Russian, which was "unacceptable", said by HR manager, who I agree with. I haven't practiced my Russian outside of chatting with friends and family members and I guess it's become a lot rougher. I mostly do everything in English now, but even that isn't perfect. As a non native speaker I have a lot of issues with pronunciation, accent, and word choice.

I would like to polish both languages and become employable, so I'm trying to organize my thought process and what my next steps should be. I'm going to start reading Russian literature, so as of today I'm picking up Dostoevsky! And for English, I need to read a lot more books too, and the area I'm lacking the most is speaking, so I need a lot of practice on that too, but I'm really unsure on how to do that in Russia. Maybe finding and hiring English native/fluent, public speaking specialist, but I don't know.

I don't have great education or experience, so I would like to sell my fluency in two languages as a skill to get some experience in corporate environment. I can't really do that if I can't prove it. I feel like a mess. I want to get my career going. 

I'd appreciate any thoughts, thanks for your time :)
