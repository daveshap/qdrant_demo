ALISON: Do we know anything about him?
DAVID: Ahm - he's male. He's English. He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time. I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
ALISON: David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
DAVID: Yes. Yes. Sometime.
