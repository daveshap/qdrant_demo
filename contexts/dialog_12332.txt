JULIET: I'm so happy to see you!
HONORA: hurries over.
HONORA: It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
JULIET: Thank you so much!
HONORA: That's coming along well!
JULIET: I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
