MIRIAM: Catherine!
NOVAK: I'll get her...
NOVAK: Edward Baines, I presume. Hi, Ed. I'm Pete.
CATHERINE: Do you think that's funny?
NOVAK: No. Not at all. From what I understand, he knows Im here
NOVAK: I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years. Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster. Isn't that something? I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
CATHERINE: It doesn't have much to do with science.
NOVAK: What then?
CATHERINE: The soul. The spirit. Whatever you want to call it.
NOVAK: Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
CATHERINE: Agent Novak?
NOVAK: Peter, okay?
CATHERINE: Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
NOVAK: Absolutely. I suppose everyone does.
CATHERINE: Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
NOVAK: That's what therapists are for, right?
