EVELYN: I don't like the word 'cheat.'
GITTES: Did you have affairs?
EVELYN: Mr. Gittes.
GITTES: Did he know?
EVELYN: Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
EVELYN: Is there anything else you want to know?
GITTES: Where you were when your husband died.
EVELYN: I can't tell you.
GITTES: You mean you don't know where you were?
EVELYN: I mean I can't tell you.
GITTES: You were seeing someone, too.
GITTES: For very long?
EVELYN: I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes. It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
