MR. JOHNNY: No, I want to see the dessert cart.
BOBO: Very good.
LORETTA: You never have dessert.
MR. JOHNNY: Never is a long time.
LORETTA: What's the matter?
MR. JOHNNY: My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
MR. JOHNNY: Have Something.
LORETTA: I shouldn't.
MR. JOHNNY: Will you marry me?
LORETTA: What?
MR. JOHNNY: Will you marry me?
LORETTA: Bobo, take the cart away.
LORETTA: Are you proposing marriage to me?
MR. JOHNNY: Yes?
LORETTA: You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
MR. JOHNNY: What do you mean?
LORETTA: We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
MR. JOHNNY: I don't understand.
LORETTA: Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
MR. JOHNNY: On the floor?
LORETTA: Yes, on the floor.
MR. JOHNNY: This is a good suit.
LORETTA: I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
MR. JOHNNY: Alright.
