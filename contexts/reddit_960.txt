Remember the 25% rule for social anxiety.
25% of people will like you and nothing you can do will make them not like you.

25% of people won’t like you and nothing you can do will make them like you.

25% of people will like you but something you do could make them not like you.

25% of people won’t like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can’t really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn’t make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone’s reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don’t let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don’t waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can’t be trusted anyways.

You don’t need to respond to anything immediately, you don’t need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn’t think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn’t matter and it’s OK for people to be wrong!

So take a load off your mind and don’t let your imagination get the best of you.
