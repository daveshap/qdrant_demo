DINO: What do you want?
EDDIE: I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
DINO: What are you talking about?
EDDIE: The loop! The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?! This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
DINO: Bullshit.
EDDIE: I'm telling you...
DINO: Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible. Why are you bothering me with this... ?
EDDIE: Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
DINO: There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt. Think about it. There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything. I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
EDDIE: Dino...
DINO: Nobody knows anything.
