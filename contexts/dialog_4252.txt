SHARON: Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
MICHAEL: Sorry.
SHARON: Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him. He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
DULANEY: I'll talk to him later.
SHARON: Why don't you talk to him now?
DULANEY: Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
SHARON: No one's asking you not to work. I just think you could make some time for your son.
