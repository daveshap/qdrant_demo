ANDREW: Particularly, Charles.
JOE: What impressed you about him?
ANDREW: He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
JOE: What kind of person is that?
ANDREW: Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street. The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
JOE: Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
ANDREW: It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
JOE: You didn't look then, the way you look now?
