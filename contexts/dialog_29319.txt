GEORGE: Sit down.
QUAID: Where's Kuato?
GEORGE: On his way.
GEORGE: You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
QUAID: Yeah.
GEORGE: Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
QUAID: What, aliens?
GEORGE: You tell me.
QUAID: I don't know.
GEORGE: Yes, you do. That's why we brought you here. -- Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain. And Kuato's gonna dig it out.
QUAID: You're Kuato, right?
GEORGE: Wrong. Kuato's a mutant. So don't get upset when you see him.
