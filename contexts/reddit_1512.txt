Does anyone else ever experience extreme depersonalization due to anxiety??
I am currently feeling like I have the biggest hole in my chest and I feel nothing??? I had a day off and I stayed home all day and played video games and had  no contact with the outside world and now that my boyfriend is home, I feel really bad because I’m not talking very much but I truly feel like I just can’t. It’s so odd. I just feel nothing. I’m on 25mg of Zoloft btw
