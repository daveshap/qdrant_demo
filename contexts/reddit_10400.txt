Fuck this pointless world
Who the fuck decided we needed 12+ years of school then you need to work a miserable job until you die.  Same fucking routine every day, vacations once a year if you're lucky. How can people not be depressed? You're fucking brainwashed if you think that this is how life is supposed to be.
