WES: Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
JAEGER: He lived through that?
WES: Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway. They flew the gunship up here to hide out. When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
EPPS: Why'd he come in our camp.
WES: Says he wanted food. Liar. He wanted the gold.
EPPS: How's he going to want the gold? He couldn't even know we had it.
WES: He...he could have been watching us.
JAEGER: Maybe we should give him some water.
WES: All last night he could have been--
JAEGER: I think he wants something to drink.
WES: I'm not wasting my water on him.
WES: I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold. Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
EPPS: Doesn't matter. Whatever he wanted he didn't get it. We've got no need staying around here. It's light enough. Let's pack up and head out.
