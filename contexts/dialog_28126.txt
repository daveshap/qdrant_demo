EMILY: Okay. The woman just can’t walk away... I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can’t you go to your Embassy?
LOMBARD: French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn’t have any. I used a British passport. My name’s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
EMILY: Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
LOMBARD: The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
EMILY: By your Austrian?
LOMBARD: Yeah.
EMILY: You don’t know why he’s come to Los Angeles? The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
LOMBARD: No. A poor little rich boy who thought he’d save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
