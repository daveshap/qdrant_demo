Angry that I am always there for everyone else but they are no where to be found when I am in need.
I've been unemployed for 5 months now, slowly losing my entire life savings. I'm old and tired of trying to start new with jobs. A few years ago I took a huge leap and got additional education in the hopes that it would equal a better salary and better mental health. My partner abused me for over a decade and when I finally left last year I couldn't keep my job because he was stalking me. Plus, the job was super stressful and I couldn't deal. Now, months later, I am stuck and every one I reach out to has let me down. I am trying to keep positive, but the rejection of job interviews and applying to hundreds of jobs has worn me down. I am pissed that my friends and family seem to have no empathy.
