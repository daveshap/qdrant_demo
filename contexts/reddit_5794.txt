BS in Biology...cannot find a job.
I received a BS in biology in May and have applied to jobs, internships, fellowships...no word from all 100+ of them. Unfortunately I have no lab experience so I know that lowers my chances of getting anything.

I don't know where to start, where to go, anything. I want to get my Master's in Microbiology, but I can't finance it right now. My plan was to get a starter job to help me pay back student loans and then move me out of my house, and put me back into school.

Any advice for someone fresh out of college and looking to get their foot in the field?
