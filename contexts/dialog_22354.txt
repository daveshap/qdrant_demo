JULIET: Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
ROMEO: I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
JULIET: That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
ROMEO: Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
JULIET: It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away. O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
ROMEO: More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
