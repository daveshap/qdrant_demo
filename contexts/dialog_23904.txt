EMMETT: I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
LANGSTON: Ten A.M.
EMMETT: Right... I thought they always did it at dawn. So long, kid. I'm sorry.
PADEN: Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
EMMETT: He is that.
PADEN: I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
EMMETT: Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
PADEN: You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
EMMETT: I understand.
PADEN: It's not going to be easy.
EMMETT: It never is. But he's my brother. We're going to California together. But first we're going to stop in Silverado and see our sister. And I can't show up there with a story like this.
PADEN: Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
EMMETT: No hard feelings.
PADEN: C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
EMMETT: You haven't got any money.
PADEN: All right, you buy me a drink.
