VERMILLION: Way ahead of you, Wyatt. You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan. Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.
WYATT: They're nothing. They're nobody. I want the Cowboys. All of 'em. I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
JOHNSON: Are you out of your mind? What on Earth'd make us-
WYATT: I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
WYATT: Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served. That means we got the Cowboys without quarter. The Black flag, brother. No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
VERMILLION: 500... Year's wages. And I never even saw a horse like that.
