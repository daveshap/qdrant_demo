WIGAND: Where are you, anyway?
LOWELL: I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
WIGAND: You try and have a good time.
LOWELL: Yeah. Yeah, I will.
LOWELL: I'm Lowell Bergman
SHARON: So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
LOWELL: Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
SHARON: Get some perspective, Lowell.
LOWELL: I got perspective.
SHARON: No, you do not.
LOWELL: From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
SHARON: You're not listening. Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
