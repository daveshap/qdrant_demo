Hard drives and partitions not showing up under files > on this computer disk utility shows both internal drives yet when I look under files > other locations > on this computer, I only see one partition of one of the drives, called computer. This is after doing a fresh install where I partitioned one drive for the os, swap, and efi, and another for /home. Another strange thing I noticed is that the drive i'm using to boot is labeled dev/sdb, and the one for the home directory is labeled dev/sda. I'm a total newb when it comes to linux and any help would be greatly appreciated.
