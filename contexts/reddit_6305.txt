Tips for first few weeks on the job? Really overwhelmed.
I just started my first full time role out of grad school and I'm so overwhelmed with everything. Some things that are overwhelming me that I need help with: 
1. I feel really comfortable with the topics I'm working with-they're pretty specific to what i researched and studied in grad school, but there's a lot of company specific lingo I don't know, and I'm having a hard time figuring out what are all the projects my team is doing. 
2. Logistics-I don't have a routine yet, and it's stressing me out. I don't wake up at a set time, or know when I can leave work. 
3. Downtime-I overbooked myself and was out every night this week until 10/11, but I'm nervous I won't be able to make time to see friends and workout.
