Trying to have energy
I'm on two different meds for my clinical depression but I still only have a small amount of energy that I have to use up at work making sure I am as normal appearing as possible, so when I get home I have no energy left to cook or clean or do anyting really except maybe minimum requiring things. Like emptying cat litter, putting more food in the fur babies dishes, making sure they have water, grab something to eat (like Dry Cereal or a Pop-Tart or something like that you don't have to do anything to) and setting my alarm for work the next day and making sure I have underwear and everything for work the next day.

So what ends up happening is laundry and cleaning and everything else builds up for the weekend and then on the weekend I spend most of the time getting the house back to a normal person level of reasonable and maybe cooking one meal and then back to the week and having to ration my energy to make sure I keep a job. I have sleep apnea and a CPAP that I wear every night but I'd still don't get the best sleep. I have some mobility issues due to injury from the Army and also being overweight. I'm working on trying to lose weight as well but one limitation to losing weight is finding, even at work, needing the snack to keep myself alert. 

 So I'm wondering tips on how to get more energy despite my depression so that maybe I can get at least a little more done so that my weekends could be more than just using up that energy to make up for what doesn't get done during the week due to my lack of energy.
