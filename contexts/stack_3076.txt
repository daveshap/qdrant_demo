What is the physical content of the principle of least action? Say the world is governed by the Principle of Least Action (or Hamiltonian mechanics) and let's not worry about quantum mechanics too much.Independently of any Lagrangian or Hamiltonian, does that tell us anything about the world? If yes, what?To put it differently, is it possible to falsify the Principle of Least Action? What kind of experimental results would do so?
