SARA: I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
GRADY: Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
SARA: Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
GRADY: I heard.
SARA: You heard? How?
GRADY: A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
SARA: Did you confess?
SARA: Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
GRADY: Really? That was fast.
SARA: I'm kidding. Hello?
GRADY: Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
SARA: Are you limping? Why are you limping?
GRADY: Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
SARA: Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
GRADY: No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
SARA: All right.
