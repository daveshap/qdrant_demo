NICK: How did you feel when he died?
CATHERINE: I loved him. I hurt.
NICK: How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
CATHERINE: I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
NICK: But you didn't hurt --
CATHERINE: No.
NICK: Because you didn't love him --
CATHERINE: That's right.
NICK: Even though you were fucking him.
CATHERINE: You still get the pleasure. Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
