HOFFY: You taking Dunbar?
SEFTON: You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
SEFTON: I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
HOFFY: What's the decoy?
SEFTON: Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
HOFFY: Shoot!
