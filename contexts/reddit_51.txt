I'm kinda lost.
Hi,I'll just get to it I'm about 18 somewhere between smart and normal(educationally) never cared about having friends,talking to a girl having a social life seemed to be fine by me cuz I thought I must focus on what I wanna be then time for these kinda things would come laterso I spent my life without giving a damn abt social life had some friends every now an then but didn't really care.then now that I get to meet a lot of new people some of whom I find interesting I feel like I can't cope, have a small talk or anything without being nervous,can't really make any new friends,even though I get to know people who are interested in my personality/admire me and they try to get close to me even if I'm interested in their personality as well.i have some good friends but I never felt like we match though they're really good people and care about me.
I feel kinda snervous whenever I'm to someone new and it never felt natural ,The only time it feels natural dealing with ppl I don't know is when I'm doing a group activity (I kinda like competition) like those you'd do at school.
Talking to a girl makes me kinda nervous even if we know each other for a long wire or she likes me.
I don't whether I'm an introvert or an extrovert cuz I could be both,but I'd say mostly an introvert.

I'm not looking for miracles or sth to completely change my personality but I'd like to have healthy social life,maybe your advice/experience help me

this is my first time asking for advice on the internet for advice,kinda used to seem bs to me but I think I might need ot,never asked for an advice about social life from anyone

Sorry for using 'kinda' alot kinda of a habit of mine
