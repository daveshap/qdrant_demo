What's empathy and how do I fake it even though it sounds stupid?
Like some ppl don't care if you're empathic and they need their problem and issues resolve as soon as possible. But why stay empathic when its going to annoy my clients or myself?

My trainer said I need to have empathy when I already have it or thinks I'm sympathic or something now he is very happy and wants me to get hired in the company and actually succeed on doing my job.

If bpo is really that basic and stressful, should I like sell houses and condos instead of relying on such a high demand and low expectation with 400 usd per month job? I'm from the Phillippines and I need help with this.
