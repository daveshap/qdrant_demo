[24M] Is it normal if I get a boner whenever talk to my crush about love or related topics or touch her near neck?
It is the very beginning of my first "Real" relationship and it is sometimes becoming too much for my wrench to stay calm. Whenever I talk to her about topics such as love, being a relationship, why we like each other or like consoling her or hugging her, I start getting a boner and it is, you know, nearly impossible to control it. I mean I HAVEN'T so far, ever thought about having sex with her because I want to be very sure. Yet, even without getting those feelings, I get the boner. Is it normal?
