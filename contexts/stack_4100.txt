Is the Golden Gate Bridge toll fee indicated before entering the bridge? I was traveling to San Francisco last weekend and went through the Golden Gate Bridge. I have just received an 8 USD toll invoice by mail (they use a plate reader). Is the toll fee indicated to the car drivers before entering the bridge? I didn't see any sign but could have missed it as it was at night (and street signs in the US aren't that well designed).The toll seems to only apply for the outside San Francisco -> inside San Francisco bridge direction (i.e., ~southbound).
