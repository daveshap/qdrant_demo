DELACROIX: I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
DUNWITTY: We just punched it up a bit. Made it funnier.
DELACROIX: Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address. Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
DUNWITTY: I seriously doubt that will ever happen. Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
DELACROIX: Just want to say good luck.
SLOAN: Break a leg.
