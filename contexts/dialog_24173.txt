CARL: There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
SUZIE: No shit.
CARL: I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
SUZIE: You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
CARL: Not someone -- Mac.
