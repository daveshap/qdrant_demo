J.D.: I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
VERONICA: Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
VERONICA: O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
J.D.: Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
VERONICA: What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
J.D.: Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
