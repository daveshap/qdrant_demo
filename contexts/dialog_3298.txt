DELIA: I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
CHARLES: At least insofar as we have our first casualty. Me.
DELIA: Otho'll know what to do.
CHARLES: What's he going to do? Viciously rearrange their environment?
DELIA: Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
CHARLES: Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town. I need Max's financing...
DELIA: Just don't tell Lydia.
CHARLES: Why not?
DELIA: I think she's in with them.
