What are the pros and cons of implimenting rent controls at the state level?
Recently, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced plans to support a bill in the state legislature to cap how much landlords can raise rent prices with the goal of limiting price increases, increasing housing availability, and lowering housing prices. The bill, AB 1482, would limit yearly rent increases to 5% (plus the rate of inflation) for the next decade and grant minor eviction protections to renters. Newsom and his allies in the state legislature argue that the bill will help end price gouging and improve the current state of the California rental market. Conversely, the Californian Assn. of RealtorsÂ argues that the rent cap will disinsentivize the construction and production of new rental housing units and exsaserbate the already scarce and pricey rental market.

What are the arguments both for and against state wide rent controls? Have such controls ever been implemented in other states, if so what were the outcomes of the controls in said states?
