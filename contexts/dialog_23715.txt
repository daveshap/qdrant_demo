DETECTIVE: And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
SUPER: Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
DETECTIVE: Is that the man who called you up here?
SUPER: Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
DETECTIVE: Medical clinic?
SUPER: Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
DETECTIVE: Well, let's go talk to your doctor.
DETECTIVE: Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
ST. LUC: Sure.
DETECTIVE: You're the one who found the bodies?
ST. LUC: Yes.
DETECTIVE: Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
ST. LUC: No, nothing.
DETECTIVE: You knew these people?
ST. LUC: I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
DETECTIVE: So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
ST. LUC: Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
DETECTIVE: I see. Then what brought you up here?
ST. LUC: It was very strange. He called me at six this morning. Hobbes called me. I thought I was dreaming. I haven't heard that voice for so long. He told me who it was, then he said something like, 'Meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. I want you to go out for lunch with me. It's time you furthered your education.' Then he laughed and hung up. I went back to sleep. He called me again at eight to remind me to come.
DETECTIVE: How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
ST. LUC: He sounded fine.
