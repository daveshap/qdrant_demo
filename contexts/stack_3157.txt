Goosebumps book where kid thinks his parents have been replaced by aliens I read this goosebumps book around 10 years ago.The plot of the story as I recall it is this:<br>The protagonist - a kid around 10 years old - realises one fine day that his parents are behaving differently from their usual selves and begins to suspect that they have been replaced by shape shifting aliens.At the end, it is revealed that <blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  the kid is actually a robot who has turned defective. The parents call the company that manufactures these robots and place a request to repair their \"son\".</blockquote>
