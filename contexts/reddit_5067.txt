Hurts Not Getting Chosen
I am currently employed but am at a job where people are leaving and we aren’t hiring to fill those positions. I was was so close to landing a job that seemed perfect for me, only to get called today that they were going with another candidate after being told my interview impressed the hiring manager but there was a late interview scheduled who they ended up going with.

I feel like I am on a sinking ship watching my co-workers leave this miserable company and I am stuck with my foot being caught and can’t get out until I get laid off from our company being purchased and being in a dying industry.

Sorry just in a poor state of mind and trying to just talk to people to get it off my chest.
