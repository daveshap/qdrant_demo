Why the earth attracts charge and where does the charge go when it goes into ground? Self-explanatory question but to add what I know, by this I will also know if I am right or wrong.<br>I read somewhere that Earth is positively charged, but is not the state (whether positive/negative) of a body relative to the near body/object. If Earth is positively charged, why is it so? Is there any negative charge around it which helps Earth retain it's positive charge?Also, what happens to charges that flow to the ground ?
