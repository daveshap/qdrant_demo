TECHNICIAN: Okay. After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC. Here it is. Ten packages from the same sender. Baku. Delhi. St. Petersburg. The guy was a real road warrior. This package was Kuala Lampur. No activity in his account after this package. No forwarding addresses after K.L.
CHUCK: What about the sender?
TECHNICIAN: Sure. Bettina Peterson. Marfa, Texas. Let's run a current check.
TECHNICIAN: Hmmm. Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
CHUCK: Can you find her?
TECHNICIAN: You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization. I don't have it.
