Technical school degree/ certificate question on an application.
I'm applying for a government job and on the application it asked education level. During high school i took a 3 year class at a technical/ vocational school. It was paid for by my high school while still taking my normal high school classes.

 I graduated and received a diploma/ certificate from my tech school. Along with another certificate from the state saying i graduated in my field. 

Does that count as a technical school degree/ certificate? My mom says it doesn't sense i was still in high school and compared it to a college degree. A work colleague said it counts because it was a indeed a technical school.
