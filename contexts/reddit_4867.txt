Pulling myself out of the pit...at least for a bit
I felt lighter today mentally. I love these days. After a long depressive cycle I am finally pulling myself out of the deep dark pit of depression. The last few weeks have been torture in my own head. I am not suicidal, but I was spending a lot of time wishing I would die naturally. Some quick accident that would end the pain. 

And then days like today remind me to appreciate the little things. Nothing astounding happened today, and I don’t know what switch flipped and made me feel a little less sad. But I’m so glad it did. 

I’ve gone through these cycles as long as I can remember. A deep dark depression followed by a remission of sorts. My depression and anxiety stays with me but I feel stronger and can keep it at bay.      ......Until I can’t..... And then I’m back in the fucked up mindset thinking that I am a piece of shit and want to die.

But today I enjoyed my life. And I hope some of you did too. If you didn’t...just know a good day is coming. They always do.
