Goodness of fit for two samples with uneven different sizes I have 2 different samples and would like to test a hypothesis about some aspect of their distribution. The first sample has 11,000 observations but the second is just 150 outcomes.From graphically comparison, isn't clear if they come from the same population or not.I tried to perform some Statistical hypothesis testing, but the main problem that I met is the large size of the first sample respect the second. I don't think that a method of Monte Carlo, to improve the size of the second sample, would be a good idea (except for graphically comparison maybe), because at that point I will have 2 large samples and any little different from them would be statistically significant.So, is it a good way trying to resample from the first sample in order to get a smaller one? And at this point perform a hypothesis test.Thank you for any help (and sorry for my english, but isn't my native language)
