Interpreting Ensemble Models The project I'm working on uses a lot of different variables to predict sales. The best model, in terms of mean average squared error is an ensemble Model which is a combination of a regression model and a probability tree model.How do I interpret this model? I know it's the average of both models and I know how to interpret the models separately but how do I interpret the Ensemble model overall?Thank you.
