Cost of PhD outside of America
Hello, I'm about to finish my senior year of university and I am planning on going on to do a PhD in either statistics or applied mathematics. I've been looking exclusively within America as that is where I have done most of my education and it was said to me that American degrees are accepted everywhere, but non\-American degrees may not be accepted in America. Nonetheless, my parents have been asking me to look at doing my PhD outside of the US specifically in the UK and in particular because of cost. I have not given this much thought, but does anyone have experience doing a Masters or PhD outside of the US? How much weight does it hold? Is there that much of a difference in cost \(feel what's more important is how well funded the program is\)? Any tips on looking for programs? Thanks in advanced.
