I want the night light applet from GNOME shell 3.24 I'm a Web Developer, working on my Ubuntu 16.04 and I want to update to Ubuntu 17.04 in order to install new gnome-shell version 3.24 just because I really want that new features such as the night light applet, I've tried using flux app but it doesn't work. I've searched for a working alternative but I didn't have any luck.
