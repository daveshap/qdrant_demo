LULA: That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
LULA: ...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
SAILOR: I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
LULA: My mama... So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
SAILOR: They have, sugar.
LULA: I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
SAILOR: It's a comfortin' idea.
LULA: Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
SAILOR: There's worse places, honey.
LULA: If you say so.
SAILOR: Trust me on it.
LULA: I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
SAILOR: We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
LULA: What's that?
SAILOR: I don't know... Looks like clothes.
LULA: Oh God, Sailor.
SAILOR: One bad car accident...
LULA: SAILOR!!!
LULA: Sailor, what are we gonna do?
SAILOR: I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
