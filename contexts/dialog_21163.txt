BRANDON: Bad?
BETTY: Bad enough.
BRANDON: He could hardly help suspecting you.
BETTY: That's putting it mildly.
BETTY: What time is it?
BRANDON: Quarter after one. Why?
BETTY: There's a lot of night left to live through.
BRANDON: So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
BETTY: Dance? Tonight?
BRANDON: Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
BETTY: Certainly not to me.
BRANDON: Just who are you, anyway?
BETTY: You, too? My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
BRANDON: I'm different. I like it fine.
