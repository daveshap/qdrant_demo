FYI: headhunter does not care about you
My employer is looking to add another person to our team even though I don't think they got enough work for us all but whatever. I've never been on the other end of the table and I was surprised to be included in the interview process since I'm just a grunt. A email was forwarded to me by my manager along with the conversion of our hr and headhunter. Basically, this kid with 2yrs experiences is seeking $70k but since he is unemployed at the moment. The headhunter said he believe he can talk him down to $65k.

I guess if you're desperate you might take the job but this show that headhunter doesn't care about you. They get paid from employer and not you so they want to get you in as fast as they can so they can make bank.
