CHILI: I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
BEAR: So you didn't have the key with you.
CHILI: You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
BEAR: You spotted them, huh?
CHILI: What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
BEAR: I have to ask you for that key.
CHILI: What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
BEAR: Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
CHILI: You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
CHILI: Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
BEAR: I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
