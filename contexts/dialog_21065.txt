STEW: What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot—
ANNE: You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
STEW: I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is? It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
ANNE: Your place?
STEW: Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve. The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
ANNE: Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
STEW: When 'we' . . .? You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
