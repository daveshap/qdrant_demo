FLETCH: Has he?
MARVIN: Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
FLETCH: Then he has.
MARVIN: Course he has. That's his wife.
FLETCH: Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
VELMA: Cute thing.
FLETCH: Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
VELMA: Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
FLETCH: He sighs.
FLETCH: And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
MARVIN: Of course they are.
VELMA: She's cute as a button.
FLETCH: How long have they been married?
MARVIN: Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
FLETCH: Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
VELMA: Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
FLETCH: No, thank you.
VELMA: How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
