Non-Performance related Lay-off, followed by a below average performance review...
A month ago I was laid off from my job. We were specifically told it was not performance related. Fast forward to this week, all four of us from my department that were laid off received below average performance reviews. We each noticed the document had been completed two weeks after our layoff. On said review, one of the two challenges I needed to work on through the end of the year was a job specific skill (Feedback below).

We’re given an option to apply for internal jobs, but I’m not sure I want to continue to work for a company that uses the bell curve system to lay people off... Maybe my emotional layoff rollercoaster crashed, but is this common? Would you continue to work for the company? 

Feedback: Job Management: ** struggles to maintain pipeline when technology solutions do not exist. (FYI- I work for a tech company and literally create technology solutions)
