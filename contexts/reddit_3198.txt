Career ideas for people who can't sit still?
Currently working for the city as a technologist in transportation and don't get me wrong, it's a great job with great pay but I itch everyday to get up and move and be active. I just can't stand the office environment anymore and being still all day.

Any suggestions for careers that require moving a lot more?
