SAM: I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...
NORMAN: This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.
SAM: And now that your mother's dead?
NORMAN: My mother is not dead!
SAM: I didn't think so.
SAM: You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
NORMAN: I don't know what you've been saying.
SAM: I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
NORMAN: Do what?
SAM: Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
NORMAN: Shut up!
SAM: Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
NORMAN: Leave me alone!
SAM: ...Forty thousand dollars!
NORMAN: Leave me alone!
