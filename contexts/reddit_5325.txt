Job attire for a 17(M) year old over summer
I am starting tomorrow and have a wide variety of clothing to wear so I'm just wondering what should I wear. For information I will be working at a hospital over 6 weeks for SYEP program and am based in New York. 

BTW I did email them but the response was to dress professionally and be presentable. No shorts, tank tops or mini skirts
