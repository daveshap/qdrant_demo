HANK: Quite a shithole, isn't it?
ED: It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
HANK: I was in jail.
ED: The whole time? Eighteen years?
HANK: No. Two times.
ED: What...
HANK: Check forging.
ED: Oh, man! So...
HANK: The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
ED: So you saw me on TV and you said Hey
HANK: I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
ED: All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out. I gotta go.
HANK: Ed... I'm sorry.
ED: Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
HANK: What...
ED: The pirate ship.
ED: -- That we were doing together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue.""
HANK: Do you still have it?
ED: No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
