I was employed because the company was expecting huge amount of projects, but now they are on hold and I've got nothing to do.

As the title says, this job is kind of like my dream job and I was very happy to join the company.  But I started to  notice from the 1st week that  project manager and project directors keeps avoiding me when I go to them and asks them questions. So at the second week they informed me about projects being on hold and there is nothing they can do since as engineering department we only do what higher management asks us to do and told two people to give me a little work, which was practically 5 hours of irrelevant work in 2 months.

Anyway I've been trying to find work and checking and talking to GM, PM and project directors a lot asking for works directly and indirectly (trying to not be annoying) and updates about the projects. But 2 months has passed now and I've maybe worked 3 days totally out of these. I'M exhausted and bored to death at work from doing nothing all day especially right now since my orientation is finished and I literally have nothing to do, also it's an open office environment so I used to try and not hold my mobile at all and act like I'm working but recently I'm bored to death and started to listen to YouTube videos and watched them a little sometimes. 

I'm very paranoid and afraid that they are going to fire me because they don't need anymore which make the 10 hours sitting at office idle worse. I know worrying about things that are possible but out of my control is stupid but I can't stop myself. 

What should I do?
