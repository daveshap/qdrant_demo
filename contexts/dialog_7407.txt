BETH: I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
JAM: I don't care. I wanna hear more.
BETH: I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
JAM: Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
BETH: You don't know how long I've been waiting to hear that... Jam!
BETH: We've got to take this slow...
JAM: Right, slow...
BETH: Oh, screw it!
