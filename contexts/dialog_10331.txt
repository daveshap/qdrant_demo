TOYOTA: You're a family man, Frankie?
NICKY: Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
TOYOTA: An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
NICKY: I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
TOYOTA: And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
NICKY: It's a complicated subject.
TOYOTA: It's a simple subject.
LILLIAN: Your father said you might be here.
NICKY: Two-all after six.
LILLIAN: I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
NICKY: We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
LILLIAN: I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
NICKY: All right. What's been going on?
LILLIAN: I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
NICKY: How prominent?
LILLIAN: He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
NICKY: I'll have whatever she's having.
LILLIAN: I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
NICKY: Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
WAITER: Yessiree, Bob.
NICKY: Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
