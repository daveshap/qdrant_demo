ANDREWS: I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious. Where'd you meet him?
ELLIE: On the road.
ANDREWS: Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
ELLIE: No.
ANDREWS: Who is he?
ELLIE: I don't know very much about him. Except that I love him.
ANDREWS: Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
ELLIE: It'll do no good. He despises me.
ANDREWS: Oh, come now—
ELLIE: He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
ANDREWS: Ridiculous!
ELLIE: He doesn't think so much of you either.
ANDREWS: Well!
ELLIE: He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
ANDREWS: Fine man to fall in love with.
ELLIE: He's marvelous!
ANDREWS: Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
ELLIE: I don't know.
ANDREWS: I'd like to have a talk with him.
ELLIE: It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
ANDREWS: Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
ELLIE: No, I'll go through with it.
ANDREWS: But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
ELLIE: It doesn't matter. I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
