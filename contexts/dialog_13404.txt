EDDIE: I came to play pool, Fats.
FATS: That's good, Eddie. For how much?
EDDIE: You name it.
FATS: Thousand dollars a game.
EDDIE: Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings. What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
FATS: Let's go.
