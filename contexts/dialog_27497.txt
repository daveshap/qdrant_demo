BILLINGS: How come you know all this shit?
DANNY: How come you don't know it? How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
BILLINGS: Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
DANNY: No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush? Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
CARLETON: Who's Eichmann?
DANNY: Who's Eichmann?!!?
