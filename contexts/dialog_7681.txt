MOOKIE: Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
JADE: Stop tripping.
MOOKIE: No, you're tripping. Don't come in Sal's. Alright, read my lips.
JADE: What are you so worked up about?
MOOKIE: Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
JADE: He's just being nice.
MOOKIE: Nice!
JADE: He's completely innocent.
MOOKIE: Innocent!
JADE: I didn't stutter. You heard me.
MOOKIE: You should see the way he looks at you. All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
JADE: You are too crude.
MOOKIE: I might be, but you're not welcome here.
JADE: Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman. You gotta lotta nerve. Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do. Come off it.
MOOKIE: One has nuthin' to do with the other.
JADE: Oh, it doesn't, huh! You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
MOOKIE: I'm getting paid...
JADE: ...peanuts.
MOOKIE: Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
JADE: I truly hope so. I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
