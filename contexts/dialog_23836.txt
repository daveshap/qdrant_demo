MAYA: Were you ever going to say anything?
MILES: Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
MILES: Maya.
MAYA: Don't touch me. Just take me home.
MILES: I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
MAYA: Do you know what he's been saying to her?
MILES: He's an actor, so it can't be good.
MAYA: Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
MILES: I'm sure he believed every word.
MILES: Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
MAYA: But you wanted to fuck me first.
MILES: Oh, Maya. No.
MAYA: Yeah.
MAYA: You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
MILES: And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
