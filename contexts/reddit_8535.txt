DoJ brief argues that sexual orientation is not protected under Title VII. What does this actually mean?
IANAL, and so I see something like [this brief](https://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/legal-docs/ny_zarda_20170726_doj-amicus-brief) reported on with a big flashy headline and I'm not quite sure what to make of it. It seems like this *could* be effectively an argument that discrimination based on sexual orientation should be totally OK, but it could also be a lot more strictly limited than that, and I don't have the legal knowledge to really be sure. 

[Here](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/07/28/us/politics/28reuters-usa-court-lgbt.html) is some less-legal-jargony coverage from NYT/Reuters, but again I'm not really sure what the actual impact of such a ruling would be.
