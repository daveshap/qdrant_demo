KAREN: What were you gonna do with me?
FOLEY: I don't know. I hadn't worked that part out yet. All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
KAREN: You waved to me in the elevator.
FOLEY: I wasn't sure you caught that.
KAREN: I couldn't believe it. I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet. Like if we could take a time-out...
FOLEY: Really? I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
FOLEY: You know I saw you on the street.
KAREN: Where?
FOLEY: Outside Adele's.
KAREN: You were going to see her?
FOLEY: To warn her about Chino.
KAREN: So she did help you?
FOLEY: I don't think we should get into that.
KAREN: No, you're right. Or Buddy. I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit. Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
FOLEY: Don't talk like that, okay? You scare me.
