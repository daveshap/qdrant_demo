I am just starting a job at Taco Bell tomorrow, any helpful advice would be amazing.
Hi everyone! I'm an 18 years old female, I have previously worked in a wood mill of sorts makings cabnits cause my neighbor offered me a job while I wait for the places I've applied to to get back to me. 

I was hired by Taco Bell and I'm starting tomorrow. I'm very excited yet scared. This will be my first time working officially and working in fast food service. 

If anyone has any advice for me I would love to hear it! Thank you ðŸ˜Š
