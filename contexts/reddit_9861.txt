Academic Student Success Resources
Hello all,

I am currently a second year in my student affairs master's program. This year my assistantship is within Academic Student Services, serving our academic success program and I enjoy the work that I am doing. With the job search coming up soon, I have been diligently searching for jobs with the use of keywords like academic recovery, student success and retention, etc. I was wondering if you all may know of other resources such as listservs, professional organizations, and/or even openings that would allow me to work within this area of student success & retention? Thanks!
