Mass flow rate of evaporating water in a vacuum I'm melting ice in a vacuum using a heating plate, and attempting to condense any water vapor evaporated from the melted water onto a cold plate. Is there a way to describe the mass flow rate of the water vapor in terms of the power output of the heating pad and temperature of the cold plate (which remains constant through constant piping of liquid nitrogen)? Thanks for your help!
