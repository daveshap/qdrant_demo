TWOMBLEY: It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
JACK: Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
TWOMBLEY: Guaranteed, eh?
JACK: Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks. This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
TWOMBLEY: Damn straight!
JACK: Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
TWOMBLEY: Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
JACK: If you get it?
TWOMBLEY: Yeah.
JACK: You might not kill it.
TWOMBLEY: You think so.
JACK: You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
TWOMBLEY: You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
JACK: Mmm.
TWOMBLEY: You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
JACK: I get it. No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
TWOMBLEY: And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
JACK: Wonderful!
LUGENE: Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
WADE: Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
LUGENE: Did you get his number?
WADE: I know who it is.
LUGENE: Good. Who?
WADE: Mel Gordon.
LUGENE: I still don't understand --
WADE: From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
