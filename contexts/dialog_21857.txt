WILLCOX HILLYER: Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
DADDY: Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
WILLCOX HILLYER: That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
DADDY: Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
WILLCOX HILLYER: I'm not blubbering.
