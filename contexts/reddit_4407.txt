The most amazing thing happened today.
I have been battling my depression for over 3 decades. I have tried things and some helped for a time. I decided at the beginning of this year it was time to start trying to get professional help for all the issues I have been dealing with. I woke up today and the most amazing thing hapoened. 
  I felt ok.not just that bur I actually had the thought that my life really isn't so bad . I thought that to myself with no prompting. And I looked outside and thought what a beautiful day it was.
  At my last appointment I had early in April I was prescribed something for my anxiety and depression and I was told to not expect any results for atleast 3 weeks.
 I asked my husband to let me know if he noticed any differences and last night he mentioned I wasn't responding normally and today even said I was being chipper.
  I don't know how long this will last but I am happy to report that for the first time in a long long time I actually have hope and am feeling pretty good.
 Things can get better.
