Password protect folder for Windows and Linux I have a basic question of feasibility - feel free to delete / kill off if too broad or off-topic.I dual-use Windows and Ubuntu because of various work purposes. I have some sensitive files where it would be best to restrict folder/file access a bit. It's not hide-from-the-NSA-secret, but hide-from-plain-access (job-applications and such). Is there a good way to encrypt/secure the folder and still be able to access it from Windows and Ubuntu with some convenience? Because of dual use, the files are not in a linux-formatted drive, so any advanced options there are out of play. A gaffer-tape solution I could think of is to pack everything into an encrypted archive (7z or so) and unpack/repack as needed, but there might be a more elegant way?Thanks in advance!
