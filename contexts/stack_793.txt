Ubuntu doesn't fit my laptop built-in screen I've installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on a FS Esprimo V5555 notebook and I cannot see a very big part of the screen. (like I open system settings and the bottom half of it is out of the screen, I can't drag and drop and I can't scroll it) I only have 640x480 resolution in the settings (my notebook can do 1280x800, it has Sis Mirage 3). Same happened in 14.04 LTS. What could be a working solution?(I am an absolute beginner about Ubuntu)
