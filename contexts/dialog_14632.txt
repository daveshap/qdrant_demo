KATHRYN: Honey, what is it?
MIKE: Hydrophobia...
KATHRYN: Michael, take deep breaths.
MIKE: I have to get out of here.
KATHRYN: Come on.
MIKE: I can't take water, Kathryn.
KATHRYN: Yes, you can.
MIKE: I can't! My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it. I can't stand it!
