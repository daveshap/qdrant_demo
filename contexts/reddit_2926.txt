How the hell am I meant to get a job after graduation if employers all want 3+ years of experience and tonnes of certificates??
Just graduated last month with an MA in linguistics and I've been job hunting on indeed, jobsite, totaljobs as well as making a linkedin. Been applying for months for jobs, however, even entry level banking jobs want experience and certificates. It makes no sense to me, how are you meant to get experience if no one wants to hire you? Even internships these days want certificates or experience. My situation is even more strenuous as I'm in the U.S and looking at getting a Tier 2 visa to work in the UK, which is where my degree is from. Specifically Glasgow uni. Everyone talks about going to uni and getting a degree opening doors for you, but I do not see any semblance of a door opening and at 20 years old, it's got me questioning if it was even worth it. Wanted to go back and get my PhD/do another degree in physics, but that's no guarantee that either of those would help me. My career guidance team basically did nothing to point me in a direction. I've resorted to adding old teachers and profs on LinkedIn and trying to network with them. What are you lot's thoughts?

Edit: I have been applying despite experience requirements but havenâ€™t heard anything back.
