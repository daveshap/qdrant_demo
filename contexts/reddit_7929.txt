Meeting with a potential graduate advisor today-how to make a good first impression?
Hello, I am meeting with a possible History graduate advisor today, who also happens to be the person who accepts graduates into their department, and I need to know how to make a lasting good first impression on her. I know Iâ€™m going to discuss how her research interests and past work align with my own interests and how I believe it would benefit both of us if I was under her supervision. What else should I say to make myself stand out?
