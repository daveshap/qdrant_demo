Is there a word for something you want in an abstract sense but wouldn't want in reality? I'm trying to separate the thing that I want (the desire?) from the effort it would take to get it, or the consequences that come with obtaining it.A noun or verb or phrase will do:\"I would love to have pin-up worthy abdominal muscles\" (but I'm not willing to put in the sustained effort to actually get them)\"That girl is so attractive, I would love to have sex with her\" (but I'm happily married and I wouldn't actually jeopardise my marriage by doing it)\"It's a dream of mine to perform at some amazing location\" (but I'm not actually going to pursue performing as a career to make it possible)
