RAMADA: Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
MAST: You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
RAMADA: At least I improved myself. What's up?
MAST: I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
RAMADA: No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
MAST: Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
RAMADA: Nope never saw her before. Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico. You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
