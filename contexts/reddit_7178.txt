Recommendations for Transcription/Proofreadings jobs?
I would really like to find my way into this gig culture industry. 

I type average speed with high accuracy (55wpm@97% accuracy), but I could definitely go faster with practice. 

I have no college degree, but I am not sure if that limits me in all pathways to opportunity. Surely there is something within reason I could pickup work in. Perhaps attaining some kind of certification which formalizes the process. I would like to know these things.

Any help would be appreciated. I really need to start finding work. Not necesarily in this field either. Advice there would be helpful. Although I am not sure what work I can do anymore, I just know I need to start making a living for myself again.

Anything helps. Thanks.
