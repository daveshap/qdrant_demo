EVE: Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
CASTOR: They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
EVE: I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
CASTOR: Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
EVE: You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law. Remember what my brother called you?
