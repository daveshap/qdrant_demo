What am I doing wrong?
I need advice badly as I feel so defeated right now. I have 14 years of automotive experience. From dealer level to on site OEM support. I have Customer support and sales experience. I dealt with high profile Customers and cases in the past as an escalations manager in a well known American automakers Customer Relations Center. For the past 9 years I have been assisting their dealer network in all markets globally with parts catalog related queries and also have a lot of training experience under my belt.

In spite of all this knowledge it would appear I am completely and utterly unemployable. And its getting to the point where Just ending it all seems like a good option. I apply for parts sales jobs and then get told they will be pursuing candidates who's skill set more closely matches the job spec???? I'm literally the guy your parts guy calls when they cant identify a part! How am I not the perfect candidate? I have applied for parts manager jobs, I have applied for the same job I am doing now but at other OEMS. No takers...

Everywhere I apply I get blocked, what am i doing wrong???? I cant find another job, I cant move up and I have been in the same job for the Last 9 years and I am so hungry for a new challenge, but it appears i am completely unemployable...
