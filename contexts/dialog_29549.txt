VAL: Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash. You're the one's gotta have a plan.
EARL: Damn it, Val! Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
VAL: What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet. I was up for going to Bixby. I was getting excited.
EARL: In the past year I must've said a hundred times We gotta get out of Perfection. We gotta better ourselves." You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here? You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?"
VAL: I'll call that little bluff. How close?
EARL: Uh oh, it's Nancy. She wants another load of firewood.
VAL: Forget it, man. It's not worth it.
EARL: She's got us. Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
VAL: That's the plan.
