Petition for all the “Paid off my debt” people to get their own sub.
This can’t be the first time someone has been annoyed with the excess “I paid off my debt” posts. Especially if it’s a crazy amount of debt within a small time frame. Real poverty level living just DOES NOT make this type of thing possible. Get your own sub to celebrate being debt free. Good god
