Student Leader responsibilities?
Hello!

I am currently in the process of looking for / creating something that expresses what it means to be a student leader for an organization. I'm looking for more than just risk management type things, but also looking for something that expresses the leadership portion of the position, too (people are looking up to you, set a good example, etc.).

Does your campus have anything like this? If so, would you be willing to share it?

Thanks!
