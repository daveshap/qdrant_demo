WALTER: But you gotta love me! Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
CARLA: Walter, I'm sorry...
WALTER: You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
CARLA: Now calm down Walter! Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
WALTER: No! I want to talk about it now!
CARLA: Walter... I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together. You know what I mean?
WALTER: Why not?!
CARLA: Because... We're just friends. That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it. I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
CARLA: Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
WALTER: Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
