No longer so suicidal, but still have 'death envy' Is that normal/healthy?
I'm in a much better place and generally more content and healthier mentally. I no longer feel like jumping in front of a train or hurling myself off a building. But I feel ok if my plane were to crash for example, I feel that's fine n peaceful. Also when thinking of ones who have passed away, I have a tinge of 'death envy', like they have moved on and no longer deal with the trivial things in life. I still want to live tho.

Is that healthy?
