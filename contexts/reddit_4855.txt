I’m in therapy
Lots of highs and lows. Lots of pretending to be okay and feeling numb. Lots of drinking and/or smoking to escape. Lots of things negatively effecting things and people in my life. I’m so tired I wanted a change. Yesterday was my first therapy session. Homegirl jumped right into it discussing what may trigger my depressive state etc. I think I may like her... hopefully I stick it out.
