ubuntu 18.04 steam installation I am new to ubuntu/linux. My question will be about installing steam on my second ext4 formatted hdd.Mind you, not just the downloaded steam games but the steam program and the games. (once i install steam program then i know there is an option to choose the game installation directory from within steam application)So the hdd is clean without any data on it, it is formatted as ex4 and when I click the mount option from the default gnome disk application, it automatically mounts the hdd as /media/\"myname\"/\"data\" where data is the volume label of the disk.I want to install steam on this disk and just keep it for steam games and gaming purposes.By now, you must have understood that i could not have yet figured out the linux file system by a long shot, however i intend to.This is all windows' fault as all we learn in computers these days is where to click and where to double click. When we want more, we just right click.Anyhow, good riddance for me.Question: Can steam app/client/program be installed on the above mentioned drive and how ? Do you guys predict any problems for me to face should i manage to do so ?thanks a lot.(i suspect i might have broken a few ask ubuntu rules in this post but hey, this is my very first question about linux ever)edit: i don't have windows on my system. Just ubuntu 18.04
