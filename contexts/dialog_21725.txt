RALPH: To lunch.
IGOR: To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
RALPH: But I have some friends waiting.
IGOR: That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
RALPH: I will only be gone about half an hour.
IGOR: If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
RALPH: All right, I'll tell them. They're right here in front.
