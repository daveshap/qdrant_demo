JASON: All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on. Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
TOMMY: Jason? What about me? What do I do?
JASON: Practice driving, Tommy.
