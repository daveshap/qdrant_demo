SIMON: Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there! Have you seen Verdell?
MELVIN: What's he look like?
SIMON: My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
MELVIN: I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
SIMON: Which color was that?
MELVIN: Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
SIMON: Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
MELVIN: How're you doing?
SIMON: Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.
FRANK: Simon, you've got to get dressed.
MELVIN: What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
