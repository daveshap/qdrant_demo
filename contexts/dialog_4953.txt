LOU: Who do think you're dealing with, huh? I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
WALTER: You are?
LOU: Good ol' mild mannered Walter! Give it up. It doesn't fly with me.
WALTER: I- don't know what you're talking about!
LOU: You're coming downtown with me, Walter. You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
WALTER: Wait a minute! What'd I do?
LOU: I got you cold, pal. Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
WALTER: I didn't do nothing wrong! That was Mayolia's! I didn't ask her for it. I don't know about any -
LOU: Yeah yeah yeah - look! I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
WALTER: Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
LOU: Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad! You're coming with me!
WALTER: I ain't going no place with you!
