Update 16.04 to 18.04 broken due to 0 bytes in /boot, not yet rebooted So, stupidly, I neglected to clean up /boot before running update from 16.04 to 18.04. All seemed to go well until right at the end I got the warning of 0 byes in /boot. But I have not yet rebooted, so the laptop is still running 16.04, yet wanting a reboot to finish installing 18.04 ... which will crash if I do that.So, is there a way of re-running the install script in place before rebooting (now that I have ex-post-facto purged /boot) so that the update will finish cleanly?I should add that the whole disk is encrypted. Which is particularly why I'm seeking a pre-reboot correction to the broken update.
