I need help with my crush
So I like this guy I've known him for about 5 years but we never really hang out I just knew he existed. But two months ago I started developing feelings for him and I am not really sure if he likes me back. He stares at me a lot with his sweet brown eyes and he teases me too but as a negative person that I am I just pretend as if any of this means nothing. I wanna tell him how I feel but I dont know how. Please help. I wanna cry so bad everytime I look at him. My chest hurts and I cant take a single breathe.
