Data Entry
Hello,

I'm looking into getting a temporary job in Data Entry, just wondering what is skills/qualifications that recruiters look for?

I come from an IT background, so I would consider myself somewhat computer literate, and comfortably know around MS Office, web development etc.

Are there any specific skills I should jot done on the CV/Cover letter? I am based in the UK.

Many thanks.
