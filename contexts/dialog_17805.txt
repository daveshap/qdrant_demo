O'DANIEL: Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
JOE: No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
O'DANIEL: Take it,easy, boy... Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
JOE: You bet I do, sir.
O'DANIEL: But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
JOE: Well, not too, I mean, a little.
O'DANIEL: I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
JOE: Yessir, I can see that.
O'DANIEL: Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
JOE: Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
O'DANIEL: Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
JOE: Uh, yessir.
O'DANIEL: Ready for hard work, son?
JOE: Ready for anything.
O'DANIEL: I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
JOE: Gonna be like money from home.
O'DANIEL: Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
O'DANIEL: You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
JOE: Get down -- where?
O'DANIEL: Right here, why not? I prayed in saloons, I prayed in the street, I prayed an the toilet. He don't care where, what He wants is that prayer.
