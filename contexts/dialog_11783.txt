ANNIE: Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
ROBERT: Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
ANNIE: Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
ROBERT: May I have a suggestion?
ANNIE: Yeah, what?
ROBERT: Take your time.
ANNIE: What do you mean?
