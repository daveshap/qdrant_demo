Why does tangential acceleration change in value? I don\u2019t understand why  tangential acceleration changes in value in a parabolic movement with constant acceleration (gravitational acceleration). Since acceleration is constant, tangential and centripetal acceleration are either both constant or one increases and other decreases in value. I was told that they both change in such movements but I don\u2019t understand why since Tangential Acceleration is the derivative of the velocity value. Isn\u2019t velocity supposed to change at the same rate in this case? And, since it changes, in which point of the trajectory is tangential acceleration at its maximum value?
