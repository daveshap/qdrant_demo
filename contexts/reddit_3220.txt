How do you think well on your feet and respond to unexpected questions during meetings?
I always have difficulty participating in meetings because I don’t have time to think through my response, especially when it comes to complex ideas. I always fumble at stringing complex thoughts and articulating them verbally.


I ended up rambling, or say something incoherent that no one understands. After time, i ended up listening passively don’t participate, or just say that I needed time to think through, which doesn’t work all the time.


I don’t have any issues if I prepped beforehand though, I could jot down points and speak while referring to the notes.

In the long run, this isn’t good for my professional image.

Any ideas on how to overcome this?

EDIT: This applies to the questions I ask during meetings too - sometimes they were phrased so badly, no one knew what I was trying to ask.
