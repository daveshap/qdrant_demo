A recovering bulimic with the urge to purge.
I've been doing okay with my recovery and haven't purged in about 5 months but the eating disordered thoughts are continuing to get stronger and stronger. Family drama insued and I was told I can't have an eating disorder, it's just a bad diet that I'm not good at.

My meal plan was chucked out the window after that conversation, and for the past two weeks, I've been skipping more meals and wondering when I'll get my next 'fix'. That long run, the skipped meal because I am too busy to eat, and starting yesterday, when can I throw up? I could use some more support, and don't know which way to turn. Thanks for letting me vent. Advice is welcome.
