ANDY: You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it. You think I'm right?
PETER: I wouldn't know.
ANDY: That's right. I guess only the killer would know that.
PETER: How'd you get in here?
ANDY: The door was open.
PETER: No it wasn't.
ANDY: Of course it was. Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering. That's a felony.
PETER: What do you want?
ANDY: You ever do any hunting, Peter?
PETER: No.
ANDY: I used to. With my old man. He taught me how to hunt and trap. Trapping's a lot harder than most people think. We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields. When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed. But they're crafty little devils. You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent. You ever smell Raccoon scent? Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy. He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it. You know why? Cause he can't help himself. The scent drives him. So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
PETER: What if he doesn't bite? What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
ANDY: Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
