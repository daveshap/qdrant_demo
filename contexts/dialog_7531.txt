MORETTI: Okay, you're in there and we're out here. What do we do now?
SONNY: I told you -- keep away. I don't know what we do now.
MORETTI: Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
SONNY: They're okay.
MORETTI: You alone, or you got confederates?
SONNY: I'm not alone.
MORETTI: How many you got in there?
SONNY: I got Sal.
MORETTI: Sal? What's that for? Salvatore?
SONNY: Sal. He's the killer. We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
MORETTI: Right -- got ya. Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
SONNY: What do you want to know that for?
MORETTI: Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
SONNY: Call me Sonny-boy.
MORETTI: Sonny-boy, one word?
SONNY: One word. You won't find it in the phone book.
MORETTI: Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
SONNY: Call me whatever you want.
MORETTI: Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there. I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me. So you can see you can trust me. So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
SONNY: I frisk you?
MORETTI: You frisk me.
SONNY: Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
MORETTI: I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny. I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me. Some sight ... right?
SONNY: Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
MORETTI: How about letting the people out of the bank. Why put them in this position?
SONNY: They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot? Talk to me then.
MORETTI: Okay, give us the women.
SONNY: Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
MORETTI: You're all one way! I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
SONNY: So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay. I'll see what I can do.
SONNY: He wants one.
SAL: Dead or alive?
SONNY: Alive.
