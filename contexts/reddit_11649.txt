I'm still in love with my ex girlfriend, says my subconscious.
One of my previous posts was about how my lucid dream trigger is my ex, that she is never the main event but simply a cameo, and that I have a tough time getting up the following morning. Well, I decided to do something about it.

I talked to her, just to see why she keeps coming up. I told her I'm over her and that I moved on. All she did was...shrug. She took my hand, and said "No, you haven't".

"I'm sorry, darling."

I forced myself to wake up. I don't want to sleep anymore. And i'm sure as hell not confronting her about this. I don't know what to do anymore....
