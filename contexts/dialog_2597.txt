CATO: Yeah, I guess.
KIT: She plays the clarinet, too.
HOLLY: Don't you ever get bored around here?
CATO: Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
KIT: That's what he told you, huh?
CATO: No, he showed me one.
HOLLY: What'd they look like?
CATO: Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
