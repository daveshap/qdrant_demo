INDY: Venice, Italy!
BRODY: What is it?
INDY: It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
BRODY: I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
INDY: Do you believe, Marcus?
INDY: Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
BRODY: The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
BRODY: But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
INDY: Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
BRODY: I'll tell him we'll take two.
BRODY: Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
DONOVAN: Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
BRODY: Schneider?
DONOVAN: I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
BRODY: Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
