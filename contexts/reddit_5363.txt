Throwing up every morning
Pretty much the title. I get up, take my shower, brush my teeth. I then think “Time to go to work” and I immediately get physically ill. This happens every morning. It’s not even food, just a horrible awful feeling. Is it anxiety? I just started working in an outbound training call center about 3 months ago and I’ve been doing this every morning. What the hell am I supposed to do to fix this?

Edit: Thanks for the messages guys, It helps. I stress posted this on break this morning, it seems like most obvious answer here is that I may be suffering from some sort of anxiety. I'll look into it.
