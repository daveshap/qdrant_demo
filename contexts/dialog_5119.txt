DR. REDFIELD: Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
EVAN: Yes.
DR. REDFIELD: Where are you now?
EVAN: I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
DR. REDFIELD: Are you hurting her?
EVAN: No, protecting her.
DR. REDFIELD: Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
EVAN: I see a car.
