I hate hate hate hate hate seeing couples on dating apps
There should be (if there's not one already) a dating app for couples looking for a 3rd or individuals looking to join couples. Im an individual looking for a monogamous relationship/casual dating and im sick of seeing nothing but couples. Its hard enough for me to find one person who wants to spend time with me
