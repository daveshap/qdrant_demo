ROBERT ENGLUND: Darker. More...evil?
HEATHER: Yeah...how'd you know?
ROBERT ENGLUND: Call it a guess...
HEATHER: Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
ROBERT ENGLUND: Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least. I asked him at the funeral.
HEATHER: When do you think it'll be done?
ROBERT ENGLUND: The way he's writing is so weird, who knows? I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...? Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God. Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
