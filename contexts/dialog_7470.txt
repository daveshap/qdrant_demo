WEBSTER: It's here you said that you closed the deal with him?
JABEZ: Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
WEBSTER: I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
JABEZ: Yes -- at midnight.
MARY: Jabez ...
WEBSTER: Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
MARY: Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
WEBSTER: I'll do my best, Mary.
JABEZ: You must go now, Mary -- you must!
MARY: All right, Jabez ...
WEBSTER: They make plucky women in New England. H'm ... how long have we to wait?
JABEZ: Not long -- now.
WEBSTER: Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
