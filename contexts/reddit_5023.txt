Hiring manager "accidentally" offered me the position—they meant to hire another candidate
Hi all,

I interviewed for a job this past Tuesday. Shortly after, I emailed my interviewers, including the hiring manager, to thank them for their time. On Wednesday, I received an email (directed to me) from the hiring manager that said I was being offered the position—I was so excited! I emailed back immediately to let them know I accepted their offer and I even received a response saying they were "happy" to have me "on board." 

However, today I got a voicemail/email saying that I was offered the position by accident, that it was an email/working-from-home "glitch." I'm absolutely stunned and devasted. 

Here is the email I received:

"Hi \_\_\_\_,

I am back in the office today and just left you a message.  I made a huge error in saying we've offered you the position. Working from home, I had computer glitches and made an error. Given that I do want to let you know you're high on our list, but still waiting to hear back from everyone on the team about ranking.  I am deeply sorry for this mistake and hope you understand. Please call me if you have any questions."

Like I said, I'm stunned and so, so sad about this. Any tips for how I should respond? I can't think clearly right now and I've never experienced anything like this before. I'm a grad student (graduating in May) and was so stoked to know what my next steps are. Is this worth complaining to their HR manager about?

Thank you in advance.

TL;DR: I was accidentally emailed the job offer; it was meant for someone else.
