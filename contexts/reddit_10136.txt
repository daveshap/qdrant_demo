New Educational tool for students
 Hey r/studentaffairs care to tell me what you think of a new Video Player tool I’m working on? It’s supposed to help you skim videos to find the most important points.This is just a prototype and we want to know what you think. We’re not selling anything, it’s still very rough and we’re not sure what we’ll do with it - but we want to know if you’d find it useful?Here’s the video and a quick 8 question survey to tell us what you think. Should we keep working on it?
