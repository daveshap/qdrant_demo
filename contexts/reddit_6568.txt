Calling out on the day of work, or "no call no show": which kind of job can you risk immediately losing if you do this kind of thing even once?
I just got thinking about this because I've had 2 retail jobs in the past and for each of those when I wanted to quit I just stopped showing up. Also there's been times where I called out on the morning *of* like an hour before work. Obviously these are not good and I've stopped doing it but I'm thinking - which kind of job will you get canned or talked to if you do this once?
