SYKES: Terrific. A real pillar of the community. Was Hubley missing anything when they found him? Was he ripped off?
JETSON: There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
SYKES: The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for. I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
JETSON: The murder at the mini-mart is not our case. The Captain said--
SYKES: Look, you want to fit in here, right? You want to learn how to get along?
JETSON: Yes.
SYKES: Well, there's a thing about partners, about being somebody's partner. You do for each other. And other people's rules don't mean shit. It's the rules set up between the two of you, that's all that counts. Understand? Okay. Well, my friend and partner was shot last night and I'm after the shitbag that did it. As my partner, I'm asking you to respect me and help me find him.
