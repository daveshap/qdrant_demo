...
Feeling unappreciated. 
Like people won’t accept me for who I am. 
That I’m uninteresting and a burden.

I’m tired of acting happy.
I’m tired of living.
I want to leave... but fear stops me.

I don’t want to hurt my family.
I don’t get treated well.
Emotions hold me back.

Nothing excites me.
My future ambitions are gone.
I love sleeping because it’s the closest thing to death.
 
I’ve started working out, eating healthier.
A lot of things I want are given to me.
I’m thankful for all of it, but that won’t save me.

I just want love.
From anyone. 
A family member, perhaps a friend or stranger.

But I feel that even if I find love it won’t be enough.
When will I ever be satisfied?
I guess I’m stuck here until natural events are the end of me...
