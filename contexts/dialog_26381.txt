ROSS: Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
GUS: Decaffeinated too?
ROSS: But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me. You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?

GUS: Columbia.
ROSS: Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee.
GUS: Wipe 'em out?
ROSS: Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
