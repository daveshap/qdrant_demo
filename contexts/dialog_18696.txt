NESSA: ...What balls on this guy? What're we... ...going steady? Jesus.
MUMFORD: No again?
NESSA: I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
MUMFORD: Really?
NESSA: I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
MUMFORD: He agreed?
NESSA: He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
