BILLY: When is mommy coming back?
TED: Soon. Very soon.
TED: I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
BILLY: Wow! French toast, really?
TED: Sure. Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is... ... eggs! Right?
