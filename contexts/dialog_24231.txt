DOCTOR LANCASTER: It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
ICHABOD: You will stay at her side?
YOUNG MASBATH: She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir? Sir?
ICHABOD: I need time for thinking. Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
YOUNG MASBATH: Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
ICHABOD: Nothing. To hell with this place and all the people here.
YOUNG MASBATH: Why... why are you like this?
ICHABOD: You do not know all that has happened. You cannot understand.
