KIRK: Can we have it quiet?
COMMANDERS IMAGE: Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
KIRK: Bob?
COMMANDERS IMAGE: Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
KIRK: You caught me on my way to the shower.
COMMANDERS IMAGE: I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
KIRK: On The Planet Of Galactic Peace?""
COMMANDERS IMAGE: The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
COMMANDERS IMAGE: The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
KIRK: With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
COMMANDERS IMAGE: Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
KIRK: Oh, please.
COMMANDERS IMAGE: Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
KIRK: Have the Klingons responded?
COMMANDERS IMAGE: No, but you can bet they will.
KIRK: Understood. Kirk out.
