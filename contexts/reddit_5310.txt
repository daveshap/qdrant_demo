Made a mistake, company lost a client, not sure how to apologise correctly, also am austistic
I  said something to someone which was taken as a threat, when I thought  it was just warning them of the truth and we ended up losing a big  client (apparently it was the final straw?).

Boss is obviously upset, I might get fired, but also it seems he thinks I'm not sorry enough?

I've  not yet been paid for the work I did last month, and I've not been  lined up any work this month. I am sorry, and I have apologised a few  times already, but I don't know how he wants me to display remose?

I  know if I ask him it'll just feel like I'm making fun of the situation  or something. Like saying, "I am really sorry, I regret my actions and  ignorance of procedure is there anything else you want me to say?"

I  know the situation is bad, and I know I messed up, but I don't like the  vagueness of "There will have to be a compromise because I don't think  you understand how serious this is." Does he want me to suggest my own  punishment? Is he too nervous to suggest something? Does he want me to  dock my own pay - I suffer too if I don't have any work, which I don't  seem to have from him this month. Also doesn't help that he's friends  with my aunt so maybe that means he thinks he can't fire me?
