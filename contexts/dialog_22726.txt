LULU: We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.
SAM: Thanks, but... we've got plans.
LULU: Well, here's the number. If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call. We also... do babysitting.
JONAH: Not.
SAM: My feelings exactly.
SAM: How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
JONAH: It plays in 50 states.
SAM: What?!
JONAH: Nobody else is going to know it was us.
SAM: You're right. You better hope so.
