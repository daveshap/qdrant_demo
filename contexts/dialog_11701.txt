KERI: Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
MOLLY: I know. I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate. Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
KERI: Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
MOLLY: Okay... thank you.
