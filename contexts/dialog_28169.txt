CHARLES: Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon. Jean... I place her in your care. Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
AULON: Yes, my lord.
JEANNE: I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
CHARLES: Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference. Take some rest.
