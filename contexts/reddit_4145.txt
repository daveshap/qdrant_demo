Today's Date Experience
Hey all, today I (27M) had a first date with a girl I met on Bumble. We went on a hike, a popular one with plenty of other hikers around- I didn't take her anywhere really isolated or anything. It seems to me that it went well, and she seems like a cool person. We got a picture together taken by another hiker on the trail. I got her number and, while we didn't kiss, we hugged at the end. We don't have a second date set up yet, but I hope to do it soon! Just wanted to share the experience. 

UPDATE (2/8/19): For anyone who is interested, I am currently planning to have lunch with her this Sunday!
