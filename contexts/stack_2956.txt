What happens to a particle in a well if the well is made bigger? Let's say we have a particle in an infinite well, and let's also say it is in the ground state. Now we make the well bigger by very quickly moving one of the boundaries of the well. How do we compute the probability of the particle being in the ground state of the new well? Also, what is the prob of the particle being in the first excited state of the new well?Assume for concreteness that the inital (1D)well is from x=0 to x=L and the new well is from x=0 to x=2L. We simply pull the right wall of the well to x=2L.
