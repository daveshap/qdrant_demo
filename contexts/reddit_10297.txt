I hate that you can’t even mention suicidal thoughts because everyone will freak out
Even if you have them and know you won’t act on them. I get in phases where every time something upsets me I have very graphic images of all the ways I could kill my self. My OCD urges it on, and my irrational side tries to tell me it’s the best option. I have too many responsibilities for that ever to be an option, though, even if I have doubts that I’ll ever be “happy.”

But I can’t say this to anyone because they’ll freak out. They’ll think they should call a hospital, or tell someone in my family, or at the very least treat me differently or not let me tell dark jokes. And all those types of reactions end up doing are further isolating me in my own mind while pretending to be relatively fine on the outside.

Edit: This is my first time posting here and I am overwhelmed that my post has resonated with so many other people here. I hope to hear from more people. Please PM me or /u/ me in a comment if you’re interested in talking about something in particular (like someone mentioned OCD and intrusive thoughts).
