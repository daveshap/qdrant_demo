DEBBIE: I can't trust you!
RICK: C'mon, I knew it was you.
DEBBIE: Rick, you're lying!
DEBBIE: Let go of me!
RICK: Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
DEBBIE: The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
RICK: I don't want that. I want to be with you.
DEBBIE: And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
RICK: I am committed. I love you.
DEBBIE: I don't believe you.
RICK: You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
