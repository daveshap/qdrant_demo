I don't want to go to school
English is not my native language, so sorry if I made a lot of mistakes.
I'm in my first year in high school, in my country it's ninth class, and I can't get used to high school after middle school.
I was a loved student, I wasn't the best and I was not very successful but my teachers liked for who I am, but now even when I wave at them because I want to say hello to them, they think I am a teachers pet.
And I can't make friends, I tried my best but, none of them really liked me, nor I liked them. I don't think I am truly a bad person, nor them but we don't match each other.
I got into the school I really wanted but my family made me change my school so, I don't like my school either.
I am not brilliant but I'm not stupid. I can easily understand something by myself. I offered my family to be homeschooled and they told they will consider this.
I have three older sibling, two sisters and one brother. They think I am being dramatic but I really don't want to go to school, I don't want to be alone and I don't want to be a loser.
What are your thoughts about this situation?
