MICHAEL: Hi...
STAR: If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
MICHAEL: What's your name?
STAR: Star.
MICHAEL: Oh. Your folks, too, huh?
STAR: What do you mean?
MICHAEL: Ex-hippies. My mom was one. I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something. But Star's great. I <u>like</u> Star.
STAR: Me, too.
MICHAEL: I'm Michael.
STAR: Michael's great. I like Michael.
STAR: I guess you're new around here.
MICHAEL: Sort of. We used to come here summers when I was kid. Now we're here on a permanent basis.
MICHAEL: Are you hungry? Wanna get something to eat?
STAR: Okay.
DAVID: Where you going?
STAR: For a ride.
DAVID: With him?
STAR: Yeah.
