Hide algorithm and variables I have some variables in my algorithm that I would not want others to see.Party A would write an algorithm which will use my variables. But party's A algorithm should remain hidden i.e. I should not see it.I run A's algorithm  which uses my variables and it produces an output.In reality the problem is that Party A might be an adversary. There are lots of parties writing algorithms so there is not only one party A. We can assume that most of the parties are not bad.Is there a way to prevent my variables from leaking out to Party A?If someone knows a paper about this could you point me in the right direction. The solution can also be one that is indistinguishably hard.
