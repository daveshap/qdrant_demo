Problem in upgrading Ubuntu 14.04 to 16.04 I'm using Ubuntu 14.04lts and today I'm upgrading it to 16.04 lts. During upgradation, my laptop got shut down and now when I'm restarting it command line is coming and I'm not able to switch to gui, I've tried startx but after this command I'm seeing only desktop folders and cross mouse cursor and then I've tried sudo service lightdm start but after running this command black screen is blinking with cursor, can anybody help?
