MRS. RAND: Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
RAND: Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
HOLLAND: An accident at the mill?
DR. MAXWELL: No -- it's about Mrs. Holland. A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
HOLLAND: What about her?
DR. MAXWELL: In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
HOLLAND: Investigation of what?
DR. MAXWELL: Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness. And, of course, the events which led up to it.
HOLLAND: In other words, I'm on trial.
DR. MAXWELL: I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul. I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter. But there's been too much talk. The thing's out of hand.
HOLLAND: Maybe it's better this way, Mother. I'm glad you're going home, Betsy -- you'll be out of the mess.
