I tried to hang myself, the belt broke.
I stood on that chair for what felt like forever. Some part of me was waiting for someone to come stop me, tell me how stupid I was and that my life was worth living. Nobody stopped me. Nobody cared. So I stepped off the chair, and felt the belt squeeze around my neck. I blacked out within a couple seconds. And what they say about “how everyone’s final thoughts are that they wish they didn’t do it” it’s bullshit. My last thoughts were of relief. Anyway, I woke up on the floor feeling woozy, and I didn’t even remember I had just tried to kill myself. This is the closest I’ve come to ending my own life. I just can’t exist anymore.
