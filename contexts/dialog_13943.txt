MILES: -- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
MARYLIN: And you must be Mr. Massey.
MARYLIN: Hello, Rex.
REX: Marylin.
MARYLIN: Are you alright? You lost weight.
REX: My whole metabolism is -- off.
MILES: So, Ruth. How's Sam?
RUTH: Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
MILES: A yert. Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
