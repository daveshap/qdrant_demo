How to stop unending “job offers” from fake recruiters?
I get an average of five calls and texts a day from so-called Indian recruiters, not including the emails from them. They never tell you what the job is for, just that it’s a “great job opportunity”. The grammar is doesn’t make sense (people keep sending me texts stating that the job pays “$17.90.00 an hour”). 

It doesn’t matter if I block their numbers because the same person will call me from the same supposed location with the number being one or two digits different. It keeps interfering with my life. Please help!
