MARY: It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
DENISE: Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
MARY: I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
DENISE: A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either, this road food is crap.
MARY: If I never eat at another Waffle House again, I can die a happy girl.
DENISE: Scattered, smothered and covered.
MARY: Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
JERRY: Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
DENISE: Tickets for what?
JERRY: This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
DENISE: I don't want to see that.
