PARKER: Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
MADISON: I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
PARKER: She's beautiful, you know?
MADISON: Thank-you. Her name is Karin.
PARKER: Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
MADISON: I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
PARKER: You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it. Where to?
MADISON: Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
PARKER: What does that mean?
MADISON: Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
PARKER: Sounds to me like a wellâ€”educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
MADISON: What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
PARKER: Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does. Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
