Can you work outside your bachelor's field, then return to the field for grad school?
Hi everyone, my situation is a little weird.  I recently graduated undergrad as an engineer (semiconductor-related) and had an entry-level job in the industry.  However, I was included in a round of layoffs just months into the job (possible over-hiring, maybe bad management, etc.)  I have been looking to continue looking for work in the industry, but with little luck.  I have an opportunity for an outside sales position that I am seriously considering, albeit simply to be able to stay in my new apartment and avoid moving back home.  

My question is pretty simple: is it possible to reenter grad school in an engineering after 1-2 years even without working in a relevant field for those 2 years?  If so, is it advisable?
