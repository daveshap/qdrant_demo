Moving to the US soon, what to do?
Hello, I work for an international company in my  home country (3 years) as senior testing technician (I have an associates in electronic systems from said home country). I’m having trouble deciding if my experience and studies will be relevant in another country’s workplace(USA). 
Should I look into starting my studios again? Or look for a job directly ? Any people in a similar position ?
