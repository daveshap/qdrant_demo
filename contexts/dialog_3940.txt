ADAM: I am so glad to see you!! I thought I'd never see you again!
EVE: Okay, down boy. I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
ADAM: I can't, it's yours.
EVE: Take it. damn it!
ADAM: Okay.
EVE: Why are you doing that?
ADAM: I haven't brushed yet.
EVE: Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
ADAM: Wait, Eve, please! Wait.
EVE: Please don't follow me. Don't do it!
EVE: I knew this would happen! You're like a lost puppy!
ADAM: Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
EVE: Okay! Damn!
