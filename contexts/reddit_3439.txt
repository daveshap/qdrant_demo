Please Be Honest On Your Profiles
Like please, pretty please be freaking honest on your profiles.

Not single and looking for a third or in a open long distance relationship? Please put that on your bio

Single but not looking for a relationship? Put that on your bio

Got a kid? Pleaseeee put that on your bio as well. 

I’m tired of matching with women on dating apps and have them not being truthful about their intentions or leaving small things out on their bios. 

I literally stopped talking to a woman after finding out after weeks of talking and on going on three dates that she’s in a open long distance relationship!! Like what the hell?!

So please, for the love of God be honest on your damn profile.

Thanks 🤦🏽‍♀️
