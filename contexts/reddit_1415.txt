After 6 months of struggling to get a job I’ve finally done it!!
I have been trying for 6 months to battle back anxiety and apply for jobs and not shut the world out completely. It’s been super rough and my mental health and self worth took a lot of battering from all the times I was rejected or ignored.

But today, today I get a win. I got a job with a lovely stationary and gift shop and I love it there, the boss and coworkers are so kind and forgiving and helpful in my training, the customers have been polite and I’m genuinely enjoying being out and around people.

It feels so good to have this breakthrough and despite there being a lot more I have to work on to be better, I got a win. I’ve gone from not being able to leave my room, and cringing at any stimulus, to being here now. 

I wanted to share the love and hope, know it may take awhile but the perfect opportunity is coming, trust guys! Hope you guys get a win soon even something small, getting out of bed and doing anything that makes you happy is a win to me. I love you all, hope this can brighten your days. :)
