DELACROIX: Let's get him over to the bed.
JUNEBUG: Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you. You never gave me no trouble.
DELACROIX: I love you too, Daddy.
JUNEBUG: Always keep 'em laughing.
DELACROIX: How long has my father been like this?
DOT: Not that often. He was excited to see you.
DELACROIX: So he drank himself into a stuper?
DOT: The drinking is for the pain. It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
DELACROIX: So what's up with you?
DOT: I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him. I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
DELACROIX: Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
DOT: Your father is proud of you.
DELACROIX: He never showed it.
DOT: He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
