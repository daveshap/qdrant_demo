A personal guide to how I went from being friendzoned and constantly rejected to not having a problem meeting women and going on dates.
Well after I loss 90 pounds I learned some things that helps with meeting new women:


•Find a hobby that you enjoy. 
 
 -it gives you something to talk about
 
 -women love hearing about your passions

  -it gives you confidence in SOMETHING. Since I didn’t have confidence, I try to find the good attributes about myself and it eventually builds up to solid, unconscious confidence.


•have some good wingmen
  
-if your friends have a hard time getting girls, y’all will just look like a group of weirdos. They don’t have to be your closest friends, but be around interesting and funny people. A group of women can often hang out with a group of guys and then they try to pick which on they want so make yourself stand out. 
 
-it’s easier to start a conversation with at least one other person with you. Girls go out in groups, you should too.


• just talk to her
 
 -I personally go up and ask how they are doing and ask if I can stay and chat. If there are things like beer pong or pool, invite her to “get her ass beat” she’ll wanna be competitive.

  -BE FUNNY. I had no confidence in my looks so my humor was an attribute I focused on. Once you get her laughing, don’t stop. I promise if you see an ugly guy with a hot girl who isn’t rich, it’s guaranteed that he is hilarious.
  
-ask her if she’s from the area or visiting. It’s always a good start up question. (Helps if you are traveling because you get to talk about traveling)

  -honestly, asking how her day is going works too. Even if she says “good” “fine” “okay” you can follow up with how your day is going in detail. If she engages, she’s interested, if she doesn’t, she probably isn’t.
 
 -EYE CONTACT EYE CONTACT EYE CONTACT. Chin up, shoulders back, hands visible. Look at her like you have interest in her. As my friend put it, look at her like you want to fuck the shit out of her (not in a creepy way) (alluring, seductive eye contact that says hey I like you) Essentially you want to completely give off the vibe that you are talking to her with interest and not just some stranger who wants to have a little chat.


•Good hygiene.
  
-there is no “bad hygiene day”. At least not to the girl you are trying to talk to. First impressions are everything. 


•it’s like door to door sales
 
 -it’s a numbers game
  
- door to door sales taught me how to hear “no”. No big deal, just knock on the next door. If you have a good approach, it WILL work, but like sales, everyone doesn’t want your product. Rejection is okay.
 
 -use what works for you and learn from your mistakes. If you think “shit I shouldn’t have said that” or “shit I should have said that” then just try it next time.


•Have at least one female friend 
  
-remember that girl who friendzoned you? Tell her you want to get out and date but you want to fix your approach. I was in the friendzone, but she was still a great friend. She told me she had a single friend but I better not ruin it by talking about politics. I laughed and she didn’t. She told me that nobody wants to hear about politics and religion all the time (or any controversial issues) and it scares people away. I didn’t even notice it until she told me and now that I look back a few years, I wouldn’t want me either. There might be something you unconsciously do that scares people off. Now I know what NOT to talk about and my success rate went up.
  
- she can put you with friends. If your lady best friend goes out a lot, she meets new girls all the time. One thing we all know is that cute girls have cute friends. It also gives you and the new girl a conversation starter. Say your friends name is Jane, the conversation could start about how funny it is that Jane set you two up and now y’all can talk about memories with Jane to break the ice.
 
 -she will make you the best tinder profile. I know a guy who’s attractive but had no luck on tinder. He gave his lady friend his phone and he got 12 matches daily. Girls know what girls like.


•good places to go
 
 -yoga. I personally enjoy yoga for myself but there are always women in there. It tends to be more successful when you establish that you are in the class for self improvement and not for eye candy. It actually makes you more interesting since most guys are too “masculine” for yoga. Don’t be surprised if you get approached. One thing going to yoga does is it gets you comfortable talking to women. They might be curious to know what a confident, comfortable, non creepy, single guy is doing there and they will ask. Just do you and enjoy yourself.
  
-meditation classes, like yoga this is another place where women (especially college aged) go for self practice. You might bump into someone who does yoga and boom, you have something in common. Ask her where she goes and if you are super lucky, she might go to the same place as you! Now you have a familiar face at the meditation place and yoga place. Also, young adult meditation classes typically have things like picnic days, bar nights, and other social events. Social events are meant for you to be social after all, this is your chance. Even if you only become friends with these women, you can use that to meet more women. They might have single friends and so and so forth.
  
-a bar. I try to go in a group of no more than 4 men so it’s not intimidating. Bonus points if you have 2 or 3 girls with you. It’s easy for a group of people to strike up a conversation with another group of people. Even if you go alone, everyone is drunk and doesn’t have their walls up so talking comes easy. Always smile when you approach.
 
 -the club. Essentially the same thing with a bar. On the dance floor, go up to her laughing and smiling and ask to dance. Look fun and be fun. If you are turning up with your boys and you feel a butt brushing up against you from behind, it’s a good chance she wants to dance. I was dangerously in the friendzone with everyone I tried with about 2 years ago and now I normally dance with 20 to 30 girls in the club. I typically don’t try to get numbers just because I genuinely go to dance, but I’ve had a few offer their number. My first time st the club, i talked to some girls and convinced them to come to the dance floor but I didn’t know how to dance so we ended up standing around until one of them literally grabbed my and started dancing. After they left, I looked at the guys who were getting all the girls and then looked at the ones standing around with their arms crossed. As a guy you can see the lack of confidence in them to go dance and if you can see it, women DEFINITELY see it. so I decided to do the exact thing that the successful guys were doing and after a few visits to the club, I became comfortable with my approach. I may sound like a hoe but I promise on a night where I danced with 20-30 girls, I got rejected by another 15-20. I personally don’t consider myself attractive, but confidence goes miles.
  
- the military. Being in the military helps a lot when you go to pick up girls because if you can’t think of anything to say, you can at least bring up being in service. And I don’t mean go out to boast and brag, I mean it’s a good response to if you’ve established that you aren’t from the area and she asks “what brings you to the area”. Realistically, there are a lot of women who love military men. Because of that, you need to be CAREFUL when looking for something long term. If I go out for a good time, I can mention military (tho I typically don’t) but if I’m looking for a relationship, I tend to save that until after I know she wants me for who I am so I don’t risk getting with someone after my benefits. If you’re in the navy, you get to travel everywhere and all sorts of crazy ass stories to talk about so you get comfortable talking to women pretty quickly. Not to mention that boot camp gives you confidence boost because you eat, sleep, breathe, shit, and shower with 100 alpha males for 2 months straight. You come out being EXTREMELY confident and sometimes borderline cocky. 


Go to the gym fellas. If you feel like you are too skinny, eat right and work out. If you feel like you are too fat, eat right and workout. I put on 20 pounds of beer belly but I can still get around. Try your best to maintain your top shape. You will be happy with the body you worked for! Women love a man of action and commitment and going to the gym is a great way to establish it. The best time to go is whenever you REALLY don’t want to go. I’m not some jock hotshot who has girls drooling over him. I still have insecurities. I still get nervous talking to really cute girls. I still have down times. But all of this has helped me improve greatly and at least got me to the point where I feel like I can go out and find a partner in the a week. I prefer to stay single and enjoy that while I’m the military. All of this is based off of my personal experience so I can’t really speak for anyone else. I’ve helped a few guys get out of the friendzone and into the dating scene with this advice and I hope I can help some other men across reddit. Please let me know if this works for you or not. My PMs are open for anyone with more specific questions.
 
Just remember this, even the hottest guys on the planet hear no. Rejection is okay guys.
