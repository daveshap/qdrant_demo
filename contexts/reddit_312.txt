Am I being paranoid or do I actually smell?
This is honestly super embarrassing but lately, I’ve become very paranoid that I smell bad. 

I shower, brush my teeth, use deodorant, wear clean clothes, etc. Nobody at school ever tells me directly in my face that I smell, but sometimes people who sit behind me lean back in their seat, and I can’t tell if it’s because I do in fact smell or that they’re just getting comfortable. Sometimes people would cover the side of their face/nose/mouth with the sleeves of their sweater. There’s this one particular guy who sits behind me in one of my classes who I know is super sensitive to smells. He talks to people who sit close by and he was whispering about how something was “disgusting” (I couldn’t hear him that well) and it turns out he had been talking about something from a magezine in class we were reading. He also said something that sounded like “it stinks” to one of his friends but I couldn’t hear him that well so I’m not sure. He doesn’t lean back in his chair away from me or anything, he actually sits pretty close to my back.

Besides these things, no has ever acted weird or kept their distance from me, but I can’t tell if they’re just being nice/polite or I’m just being paranoid.
