MELINA: Hauser, you're lost your mind.
QUAID: I didn't lose it. Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else. Me.
MELINA: This is too weird.
QUAID: Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
MELINA: Wait, did you say wife?...Are you fuckin' married!!?
QUAID: She wasn't really my wife.
MELINA: Oh, she isn't really your wife. How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
QUAID: Forget I said wife.
MELINA: No. Let's forget everything! I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
QUAID: Why would I lie to you?
MELINA: Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
QUAID: Don't be ridiculous.
MELINA: You never loved me, Hauser! You just used me to get inside.
QUAID: Inside what?
MELINA: I think you better leave.
QUAID: Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
MELINA: I'm not falling for it.
QUAID: He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
MELINA: Get out!
