PATRICK: Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about? Last time I checked, you weren't black. I'm not sure what the hell you are. But I know you aren't a black man.
MAURICE: I am the future. I am all colors. All races. All creeds. I am the melting pot. I am the tossed salad. I am post racial.
PATRICK: Post-toasted's more like it.
