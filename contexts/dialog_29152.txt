HARMSWAY: Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
YUNG: You have to leave -
HARMSWAY: A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization. And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock. The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen.
