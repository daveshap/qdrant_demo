I slightly disfigured my face 8 years ago, but its been bothering me recently.
I'm a 17 year old male. Slightly disfigured my face as a kid when I fell from the top of a couch and fell face flat, causing a bump on the top of my head. The bump has healed and disappeared but it's made my right eye look noticeably different from my left. It's noticeable, but most people wouldn't bat an eye. I haven't had any relationship luck in a long time so I'm pretty sure it's just my mind being insecure and making excuses for myself but it just bothers me. My mind right now is being really stupid filling my head with thoughts such as if my face was more symmetrical how much better would life be and other thoughts. Thanks for reading.
