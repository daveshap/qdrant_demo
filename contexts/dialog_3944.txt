ADAM: We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
EVE: It's your life. And, by the way, it's a dandy.
ADAM: I guess we'll need another locker.
EVE: No problem. We'll just sell another baseball card.
ADAM: You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - - but, I'd just be lost without you.
EVE: Thank you.
ADAM: And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
EVE: Adam? Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry. I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
ADAM: Okay.
EVE: Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
ADAM: There's something else I would like you to help me with.
EVE: Name it.
ADAM: Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
EVE: Oh, I'm sure it will!
ADAM: Then forget it.
EVE: No, no! I'm sorry! What is it?
ADAM: This is for me.
EVE: Think of me as your genie. Just ask.
ADAM: Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
EVE: A wife?
ADAM: Yes.
EVE: What for?
ADAM: Because I want to get married.
EVE: Why?!
ADAM: I don't want to be alone.
EVE: You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
ADAM: Bites what?
EVE: The big one!
ADAM: It does?
EVE: Sure.
ADAM: I didn't know that.
EVE: Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
ADAM: They're all divorced?
EVE: Everybody's divorced.
ADAM: It didn't used to be that way.
EVE: I wouldn't know. What kind of wife are you looking for?
ADAM: One who's not a mutant.
EVE: No dogs, huh? Okay.
ADAM: And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
EVE: When do you need her by?
ADAM: Two weeks.
EVE: Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
ADAM: That's what I was afraid of.
