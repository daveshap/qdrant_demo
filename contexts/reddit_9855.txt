Question about resumes - When do I remove my undergrad experiences and which ones should I keep?
Hi all! I am about to start my MA program this fall and I was wondering how I should go about updating my resume. About when should I remove my undergrad experiences from my resume? I have a number of experiences from undergrad that are higher level leadership positions, but I know they pale in comparison to my assistantship I will have in the fall. Any guidance would be helpful, thanks!
