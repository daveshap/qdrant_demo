ED: How many families we talking about here?
ERIN: Four more. Eleven people. So far.
ED: You think there's more?
ERIN: Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967. A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
ED: This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
ERIN: Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
ED: Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family. Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it. I'll take it on.
ERIN: You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
ED: Yeah, yeah. Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
