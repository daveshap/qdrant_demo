RIPLEY: Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
PETER: Not at all. Morning Tom.
RIPLEY: Hi. Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
MARGE: Dickie was at the Opera last night.
RIPLEY: I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
MARGE: He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home. I'm going to go home.
RIPLEY: Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
PETER: We think he's had a change of heart. So we should be celebrating.
MARGE: I hope so.
PETER: That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said -- Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --
RIPLEY: My God.
PETER: But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
RIPLEY: It's fantastic. I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty.
