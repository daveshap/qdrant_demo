RAYMOND: I think we went the wrong way.
SAMI: Oh, you think?
MARCEL: The map said to go left.
JULIEN: Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
MARCEL: Oh yeah.
BONANNO: Frankie, come in. Good to see you. You want something?
ZAMMITO: No, I'm good, Angelo.
BONANNO: I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
ZAMMITO: Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
BONANNO: And?
ZAMMITO: And nothing. He's just feeling us out.
BONANNO: He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
ZAMMITO: He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
BONANNO: Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
ZAMMITO: I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
BONANNO: They're gonna be what?
ZAMMITO: Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
BONANNO: Good word.
