Do the recently released emails relating to Donald Trump, Jr. indicate any criminal wrongdoing?
The New York Times has gained access to an email conversation between Donald Trump Jr. and Rob Goldstone.  The Times first reported on the existence of the meeting [Saturday] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html).  Further details in reports have followed in the days since ([Sunday] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html?mcubz=2), [Monday]  (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-russia-email-candidacy.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fpolitics&action=click&contentCollection=politics&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sectionfront))


This morning emails were released which show that Trump Jr was aware that the meeting was intended to have the Russian government give the Trump campaign damaging information on Hillary Clinton in order to aid the Trump campaign.  

In particular this email exchange is getting a lot of attention:

>Good morning

>Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting.

>The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.

>This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump – helped along by Aras and Emin.

>What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?

>I can also send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.

>Best

>Rob Goldstone

>>Thanks Rob I appreciate that. I am on the road at the moment but perhaps I just speak to Emin first. Seems we have some time and if it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer. Could we do a call first thing next week when I am back?

>>Best,

>>Don
