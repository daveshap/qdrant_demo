The Minneapolis City Council has pledged to vote to disband it's police force. Does this have precedence? What alternatives may exist?
A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council has vowed to to de-fund and disband their police force.(https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/us/george-floyd-protests-sunday/index.html).

What precedent does such a move have historically? Have other communities done something like this before? What was the result of such actions?

Most importantly, what possible avenues does the city have to replace the functions of the police force? Washington Post has a write-up on what such a move likely intends, but have there been other alternatives put forward? Currently it seems that the intention would be to move many of the police force's current responsibilities to more specialized organizations.(https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/07/defund-police-heres-what-that-really-means/)
