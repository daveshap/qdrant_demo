DUDE: C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
LEBOWSKI: WHAT?!
DUDE: I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
LEBOWSKI: What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
DUDE: I'll tell you what I'm blathering about! I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself!
DUDE: Well sure, look at it! Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
LEBOWSKI: No. No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
BRANDT: That had not occurred to us, Dude.
DUDE: Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for. Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
LEBOWSKI: Brandt, give him the envelope.
DUDE: Well, okay, if you've already made out the check. Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
