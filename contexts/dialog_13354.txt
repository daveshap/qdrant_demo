EDDIE: Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
CHARLIE: You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
EDDIE: I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
CHARLIE: Why?
EDDIE: Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
CHARLIE: Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
