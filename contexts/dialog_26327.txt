ETHAN: You're alive! She didn't kill you!
SUPERGIRL: Who didn't?
ETHAN: That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
SUPERGIRL: You love me?
ETHAN: My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
SUPERGIRL: We have to have a long talk about all this.
ETHAN: I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
BIANCA: Home?
SELENA: No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
BIANCA: Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
