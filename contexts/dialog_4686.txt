ABBOTT: No. We can't risk it.
CONKLIN: Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago. Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge. This is it. He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear. You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
ABBOTT: This doesn't go upstairs.
RAWLINS: Mr. Kane... Come right in...please...have a seat.
BOURNE: Thanks.
RAWLINS: Well... I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
BOURNE: Really.
RAWLINS: We thought you were gone for good.
BOURNE: Did you?
RAWLINS: Well, I mean it's a tough business, isn't it? Cutthroat.
RAWLINS: Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better. I'm assuming you're still in the market. It's the same vessel?
BOURNE: Yes.
RAWLINS: We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
BOURNE: Okay.
RAWLINS: Was it the break-in?
BOURNE: Excuse me?
RAWLINS: We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking. Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
BOURNE: I hadn't heard.
RAWLINS: Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
BOURNE: That'd be great.
MARIE: I found it. It took six calls. I found Kane. I found the body.
BOURNE: Let's go -- We got to get away from this phone.
