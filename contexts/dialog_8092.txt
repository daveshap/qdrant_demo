TREVES: Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
MOTHERSHEAD: Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
TREVES: Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
MOTHERSHEAD: I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
TREVES: Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
MOTHERSHEAD: But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
TREVES: Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
MOTHERSHEAD: I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
TREVES: You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
