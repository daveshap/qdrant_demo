SARAH: Fifty-seven.
EDDIE: I'll be up later.
BERT: Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
SARAH: We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
BERT: I want to talk to you.
SARAH: Do we need words?
BERT: Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
SARAH: You know what's good for him?
BERT: To win.
SARAH: For whom and for what?
BERT: For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
SARAH: You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
BERT: All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
SARAH: No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
BERT: Well, nobody has to sell.
SARAH: You bastard.
BERT: Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
BERT: I'll make it up to you.
SARAH: How?
BERT: You tell me.
