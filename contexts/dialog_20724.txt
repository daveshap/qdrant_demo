RENEE: Geoff? Anybody see my boy?
GEOFF: Right here, Mom...
RENEE: How long have you been here?
GEOFF: Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
RENEE: How did it go with your father last night?
GEOFF: Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight... I mean... he misses you, Mom...
RENEE: I miss him too...
