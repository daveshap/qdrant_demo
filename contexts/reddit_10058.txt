Advice
Hello everyone! I am here to vent/ & or seek advice from professionals that are already working professionals in Student Affairs. I am currently one year post BA in Psych & was/still am interesting in pursuing a career as an academic advisor for undergrad/or graduate students. I am located in the Los Angeles area. I have been trying to apply for jobs to break into the field so I can look like a competitive applicant for admissions. Although recently I have become reluctant in pursuing a degree in higher ed/college counseling at all. I wanted to know how difficult it is to succeed in this field if I wanted to pursue a career in advising? The reason I ask is I am scared of the job market, I notice there would be one or two advising positions here and there and I heard they were really competitive, e.g 500 applicants for one advising position? I know it’s based on experience which I have been trying to get but won’t even get hired for entry positions at local universities. I have started looking into Human Resources as another possible career path because there is a huge demand in employment. I am stuck because although I’m not enthusiastic in pursuing business and management and my expertise is not in the field I feel I would only pursue it because of job security but my passion is to be a Latina In Higher Ed & eventually maybe someday be a program coordinator or director, but I’m scared if I get a MA in Student Affairs it would be hard to find a stable job & also accumulate debt... does anyone have any insights or advise?
