I went outside today after 6 months of not leaving my house.
It all started when I got an appointment to my therapist, but with two days before the appointment day my body and mind went crazy. Started having panic attacks, couldn't eat or sleep and in the end I cancelled the appointment. That was the thing that made me say: "fuck this, I need to do something" - called one of my close friends, and we walked and talked for almost three hours. I still had awful sensations but not that intense compared with two years ago when I started having them.

Edit: grammar 

L.E.: Today I went to the mall, buyed myself some clothes and went to eat in a fast-food with my friends. I don't know what will be tomorrow, maybe I'm not gonna' leave my house for another 6 months, but today I felt like a human being again.
