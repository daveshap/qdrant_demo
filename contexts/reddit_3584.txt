Why I like being single
Yes, I know this is a dating subreddit, but I figured it might help to share the view from the other side.  (I should probably mention that I'm ASD (formerly Asperger's), so my perspective is different from the norm.  YMMV.)

There's a lot to romantic relationships.  Stages, timings, things you should or should not do or say, etc.  Being single means I don't have to worry about or keep track of any of those.  There's the darker side of relationships--manipulation, abuse, cheating, divorce--that I completely avoid.  There's also the perils of dating that I avoid--getting ghosted, getting stood up, being led on, being used, and being stalked or worse.  Being single means that I'm the only one driving, and have full control over how I spend my time and money.  Finally, there's a strong sense of security and stability when you are the only factor in your life.

While I'm sure that "the right one is out there," the cost and risk associated with being in a romantic relationship just isn't worth it for me.  Maybe I'll bump into someone who'll make me reconsider, maybe I'll be one of the lucky few who find "the one."  Until then, I have a career to pursue, a house to  buy, competitions to win, a furbaby to raise, and a host of video games to play (so psyched for Cyberpunk!).

TLDR; Being single isn't a curse.  Just like being in a relationship, it has it's own pros and cons.  You can prefer one over the other, and still be happy in both.

Be kind to each other, tip your waiters, learn to love yourself as you are (not how other people may or may not see you).
