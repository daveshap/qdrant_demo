Comparison of measurement methods I have three sets of measurements (A, B, and C) of the same thing. One of them is the gold standard (say A). I want to determine if B and C overestimate or underestimate the true measurement (which is A) and by how much. Can I simply use the sum squared error between A and B, and A and C? If not, which other statistical tool can I use to determine that?The measurement is a distance in centimeters and there are 32 subjects in the study.
