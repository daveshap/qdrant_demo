Got contacted by a possible scamming staffing agency
Hey guys 
I got a call from a guy from Coders Data saying he's interested in finding me a suitable job. They will provide me infinite interviews until I secure a Job as well as pay for travel costs for interviews.
 Catch is I have to pay $500 upfront to ensure their services. This money is a security deposit to ensure I don't leave during the hiring process . I was reluctant and they kept on pressing me to take their services. The guy calls me everyday for it. When I wasn't convinced, he transferred me to his manager who kept insisting to take his company's services. 
I looked up the company and it looks legit but IDK if I should take it or not. 
Thoughts ?
