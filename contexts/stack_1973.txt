Limitations of 'unless' in remote conditionals Regarding the use of unless in a remote conditional*, The Cambridge Grammar (p755) says:<blockquote>  Unless occurs in open conditionals and, less freely, remote ones:    [52]    ...    iv I wouldn't suggest such a plan unless I thought it was feasible.    ...    The implicature of the remote version, as in [iv], is that not-P is false or probably false: [iv] conveys that I do think it is feasible.</blockquote>Although The Cambridge Grammar says unless \"occurs less freely in a remote conditional\" than in an open conditional, [52iv] is the only example in the Cambridge Grammar of unless being used in a remote conditional. Therefore, the book fails to address the limitations of unless occurring in remote conditionals.What are the limitations? For example, does this work?<blockquote>  I wouldn't have suggested such a plan unless I had thought it was feasible.</blockquote>For those who are not familiar with the Cambridge Grammar terminology, a remote conditional is explained as follows:<blockquote>  The remote construction differs from the open in that it entertains the condition as being satisfied in a world which is potentially different from the actual world.</blockquote>And the remote conditional corresponds to the second and third conditionals in traditional grammar.EDITThe question specifically asks about the validity of <blockquote>  I wouldn't have suggested such a plan unless I had thought it was feasible.</blockquote>As the title suggests, however, what I'm looking for is a more general answer detailing the limitations of 'unless' in remote conditionals as only vaguely suggested by the Cambridge Grammar, than simply discussing the validity of the given example sentence.So please don't be limited by the example sentence and feel free to add other example sentences to better answer the question, as you see fit.
