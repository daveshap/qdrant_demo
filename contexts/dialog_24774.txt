KYLE: Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
MR. MACKEY: So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
CARTMAN: Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
MR. MACKEY: Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
CARTMAN: You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
MR. MACKEY: Eric!!!! You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
CARTMAN: Help yourself prickfuck!
MR. MACKEY: I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
