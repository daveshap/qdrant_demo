What tools are available to compare a 'before' and 'after' security baseline of a Windows machine? A vendor deals in software that provides secure-messaging software to medical practices, which integrates with popular clinical systems.  To install it, they're requesting an hour of unattended remote administrative access using 'Team Viewer' to the server which holds the SQL database where all the sensitive patient data is held. As the collector of the data, our practice is legally responsible for its use and disclosure to 3rd partiesSupposing I were to permit this (which is currently not likely), what tools are at my disposal to enumerate how the system state changed after the tech has left the machine, so that I KNOW what the did, and what they didn't do?  (As regards the final state of the machine).To make things slightly easier, the machine is a Hyper-V VM.Such tooling would consider changes to at least:file hashesfile-system permissionsuser accounts &amp; permissionsnetwork shares sharedfirewall rulesnetwork ports listened onservicesregistry keys &amp; permissions
