Apparently May is Mental Health Month and Iâ€™ve officially decided to seek help!
Iâ€™ve been on medication before and I donâ€™t love it-but thatâ€™s not to say that it doesnâ€™t help. I just didnâ€™t like it for me. However, Iâ€™ve never really had continued help. So now that covid is taking over and my anxiety is getting a lot worse Iâ€™ve officially decided to reach out to some therapists in my area. Fingers crossed I find a good one!

Edit: thanks so much for the love everybody! we are all in this together and need to do whatâ€™s best for all of us, individually. ðŸ’œ
