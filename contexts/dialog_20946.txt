ZIRA: 'I am not a missing link.'
CORNELIUS: Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
ZIRA: Well, maybe they're not.
CORNELIUS: No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
ZIRA: Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
CORNELIUS: Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
CORNELIUS: Dr. Zaius --
ZAIUS: Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
CORNELIUS: Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
ZAIUS: You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
CORNELIUS: Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
MAXIMUS: What is that?
ZIRA: A man, Dr. Maximus.
MAXIMUS: I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
ZIRA: Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
MAXIMUS: Why special?
ZIRA: We're -- conducting a new experiment.
ZAIUS: Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
ZIRA: Yes, Sir.
