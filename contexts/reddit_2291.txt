To Rising Seniors: Just remember...
In about half a year, our applications will be done. I know it seems like a long time, but our high school career has gone by with the blink of an eye. Suddenly, we're all seniors. Suddenly, we're all adults. And in at most 264 days from now, you'll be saying "I have proudly committed to \_\_\_\_\_\_'s Class of 2024." Hold your head up high and keep your expectations low. Only then will you be content with the final results, no matter what they are.

Class of 2024 Forever <3
