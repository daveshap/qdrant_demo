[Modpost] PSA: OP's, please don't be afraid to start a dialogue with people that comment on your threads. They can do a lot more than just listen, if you are in need of that.
I wanted to let you guys know that it is ok to just vent for awhile, but it's also ok to interact with people too, and if you had any initial hesitation to do so, it's alright. Talking with people that really care is a good way to form personal connections, resolve problems, and even make friends. Hope you're all doing well.

Regards,
