STEW: Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one. What's Michael tearing the paper about?
GRAYSON: Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
STEW: Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
GRAYSON: No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
STEW: Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
MRS. SCHUYLER: Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandâ€”and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
STEW: Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
STEW: Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
GRAYSON: We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
STEW: A statement? Good.
GRAYSON: I have it here.
STEW: Good.
