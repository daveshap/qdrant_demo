MICHAEL: I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
JACOB: If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
MICHAEL: The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
JACOB: So why tell me now?
MICHAEL: Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
JACOB: You come here often?
MICHAEL: Sometimes. When it's convenient.
JACOB: How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
MICHAEL: Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
MICHAEL: I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
JACOB: Never?
MICHAEL: I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
JACOB: What is it?
MICHAEL: Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
JACOB: I don't know.
MICHAEL: Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil
JACOB: One drop?
MICHAEL: It's strong stuff.
JACOB: I think I'm falling asleep.
MICHAEL: Pleasant dreams.
JACOB: I can't move.
MICHAEL: Just relax.
JACOB: What's happening? Help me.
