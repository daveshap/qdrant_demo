Poverty finance?
This sub has turned into a place for people who obviously don't have any financial problems bragging about how they paid off their loans in 1 fourth off the time or paid off 50000 dollars in credit card debt in 2 years etc. While im very happy for you guys, you wouldn't know poverty if it bit you on the ass.
