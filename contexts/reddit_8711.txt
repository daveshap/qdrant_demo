What are the arguments for and against expunging marijuana convictions in legalization legislations?
I was recently reading an article in the NYT about marijuana legalization laws hitting a wall in New York and New Jersey.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/nyregion/marijuana-legalization-ny-nj.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/nyregion/marijuana-legalization-ny-nj.html)

One of the points the article mentions about New Jersey, when talking about possibly reviving the legalization movement there, is that:

>...in New Jersey, the proposal’s sponsors have discussed changing the current bill, including removing an expungement provision that would have cleared convictions for people who were caught in possession of up to five pounds of marijuana.

It seems the expungement of marijuana convictions is a controversial topic when trying to pass these legislations. Looking at other states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, the topic of expungement is indeed controversial: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prosecutors-can-help-erase-old-weed-convictions-so-why-arent-they\_n\_5ae9e76fe4b06748dc8ed3da](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prosecutors-can-help-erase-old-weed-convictions-so-why-arent-they_n_5ae9e76fe4b06748dc8ed3da)

Given what' I've read, the arguments **for** seem to relate to fairness as well as civil rights:

>“I think the simplest way of looking at it for us is just that these people have convictions that if they were to commit them today they wouldn’t be a crime,” Jiron said. “So it seems unfair to basically saddle them with a conviction for something that is now legal.” 

And on the Civil Rights front:

>The nation’s war on drugs has disproportionately harmed low-income and communities of color — blacks are nearly 4 times more likely to be arrested for possession of marijuana than whites, despite similar rates of use of the drug, according to the[ American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/issues/mass-incarceration/smart-justice/war-marijuana-black-and-white).

On the **against** side, the article quotes this argument:

>Some prosecutors can be hesitant about retroactive relief over concerns that a marijuana conviction may be just one of many charges that were once filed against a defendant, Eisen said. That’s because more than 90 percent of felony convictions at both the state and federal level are the result of plea bargains. If a defendant is facing multiple charges, the plea process allows for them to plead guilty to a lesser crime, while not facing a trial, and possible conviction, for the more serious charges. But charges that weren’t brought shouldn’t necessarily be held against a defendant, Eisen said.

So my questions are:

1. How do jurisdictions that have legalized marijuana address these concerns about other offenses that are not in the books?
2. Are there any other arguments for or against expunging marijuana convictions (as part of legalization efforts OR after the fact)?

Side Note: New Jersey and New York are special in this case as they are the first **states** ([some territories have](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/09/21/governor-signs-marijuana-legalization-bill-making-history-in-us-territory/#539b23f027ea))  to try to pass recreational legalization by state legislation ([https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline\_of\_cannabis\_laws\_in\_the\_United\_States#/State](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline_of_cannabis_laws_in_the_United_States#/State)). All other states which passed recreational marijuana did so by ballot initiative.
