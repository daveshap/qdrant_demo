EDDISON: What were you doing up there?
HARRY: I'm a private detective. I was hired to follow somebody for a few days. A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
EDDISON: Tapert. So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
HARRY: Tapert's got nothing to do with this. He came here to get his palm read.
EDDISON: What makes you so sure?
HARRY: I got a file on him two inches thick. He's a petty fraudster. This is something else. Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
EDDISON: New one on me. Okay. Let's see him.
EDDISON: Where the fuck is he?
HARRY: He got up and walked.
EDDISON: After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
