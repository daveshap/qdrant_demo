NINOTCHKA: Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
LEON: No. Nobody will find us.
NINOTCHKA: Are we going to build our little house?
LEON: Yes... a little white house.
NINOTCHKA: Not white, darling.
LEON: All right, we'll make it red.
NINOTCHKA: No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.

NINOTCHKA: And we won't stretch up our arms...
LEON: No! No!
NINOTCHKA: ...and we won't clench our fist...
LEON: No! No!
NINOTCHKA: Our salute will be a kiss.
LEON: Yes... a kiss... salute!

LEON: I know... it's the Russian soul.
NINOTCHKA: Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.

NINOTCHKA: Much happier.
LEON: All right.
NINOTCHKA: I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
LEON: Let's turn on the radio.
NINOTCHKA: Radio! What is radio?

NINOTCHKA: Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
