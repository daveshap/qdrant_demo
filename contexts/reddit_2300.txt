Unpopular Opinion: Some of y'all really brought these rejections on yourselves
Please, dear god, apply to a range of schools of varying selectivity. I see some of the 2020 gang applying to all the t10s and their state school and being completely shocked when they get 1 acceptance. I don't care how good you think your application is, unless you're Greta Thunberg, you should apply to a range of schools. Apply to some with a 15% acceptance rate, but also some with a 50% acceptance rate and definitely a couple with a 70%+ acceptance rate.

**It kills me** to see some people on this sub who have accomplished amazing things and gotten fantastic GPAs and test scores have no choices besides community college and taking a gap year. Of course, those are two perfectly fine options, but it sucks if you are being forced into those options, and you deserve to have a choice.

**Don't even come at me** with that "but my SAT was in their 25-75 percentile! I never could have predicted rejection!". You have to know that a school with a <30% acceptance rate will look at things besides your SAT score. Having stats in the range of t20s doesn't mean you are likely to get in. It opens a door for you to be considered admission (disclaimer: of course there are those who have stats lower than the range but make up for it by being fantastic in all other aspects and you all are amazing!)

If you did not know that, I'm sorry you had to be disillusioned like this. My friend had a 36 ACT and 4.0 UW GPA and was appalled when she didn't get into Stanford today, because she thought that her stats were enough, when really, **it's so much more than that**. I'm not saying the system is right or wrong, but that's what we're working with.

Also, some of y'all are like "but I did 3 internships and wrote a published research paper and volunteered 300+ hours and started a nonprofit but only got into my state school wtf1!1!!" And to that, I say, I'm sorry. That sucks. But, when you look at the schools these people apply to, many of them just apply to HYPSM and then one safety school, and ask themselves where they went wrong.

It's just really sad, because there are so many amazing applicants that shotgunned all the t20s or Ivys or UCs and got rejected/waitlisted from all of them, when they would have gotten accepted at t40s or t50s. For example, if you love Yale, by all means, apply! But also apply to some other low reaches/high matches/low matches/safeties.

See here, a balanced profile: Yale(6%), Boston University(18.5%), Northeastern(19%), University of Florida(31.4%), Purdue (58%) , Clemson(51%), VATech (70%), Loyola University New Orleans,(90%)  University of Maine(91%)

See here, a foolish profile (sorry if I call you out): Ivy league, MIT, Stanford, UC Hicago, Caltech, some selective UCs OOS, and the University of Wyoming.

I know that this is not a popular belief, especially right after rejection season. I've gotten many rejections as well, and it hurts big time, but Class of 2021, you just **need to be practical** about your applications. I know that a t50 doesn't sound as exciting to those of you who are conditioned to only accept ivy leagues or UCs, but if you don't like your state school/safety, you need to find some more safe options. **t20s and even t30s are NOT your safety/match schools** (rare exceptions of course), so find a range of schools. PS (GATech isn't ur fucking safety school if you're OOS!).

I swear to God, if I see any of you 21ers out there next year like "shit got rejected from my safety, UC Irvine and my match, Cornell/SUNY Ithaca", blood will be shed in this chat!

Sincerely,

A concerned senior
