GABRIELLE: Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please. Lila.
NATHAN: Shit. Hi, honey.
LILA: So, how's it going today?
NATHAN: Good. Making progress.
LILA: Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
NATHAN: Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
LILA: Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
