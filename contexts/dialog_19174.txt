WAYNE: You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
MICKEY: You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
WAYNE: Tell me about the purity.
MICKEY: It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
WAYNE: Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
MICKEY: I'm sure we will.
WAYNE: Describe Mallory.
MICKEY: Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
WAYNE: Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory. What's up here? What's in here?
MICKEY: That's indescribable.
WAYNE: Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
MICKEY: Says who?
WAYNE: Says the United States of America.
MICKEY: When have they ever been right?
