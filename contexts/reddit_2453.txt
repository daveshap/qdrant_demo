Who changed their career to something completely different in their 30s or later?
As someone who is currently happy to still have a job but nevertheless deeply unsatisfied with their work life, I was wondering about stories of people who have changed to something completely different after 10 or so years in an industry.

Like banker to electrician, or programmer to language teacher. Whatever, that kind of stuff.
