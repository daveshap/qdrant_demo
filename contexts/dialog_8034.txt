TAMMY: What do you want?
PAUL: Oh. Hi, Tammy. I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
PAUL: I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
TAMMY: Okay, Paul. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
TAMMY: Now could you leave me alone?
PAUL: Yeah. Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything. But that's okay, you know. l respect your privacy. I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister. Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
TAMMY: Sure, Paul. No hard feelings.
PAUL: Okay. Great. I feel good.
