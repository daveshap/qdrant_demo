TRACY: Anything wrong?
DUTTON: Let's hope not. License and registration please.
DUTTON: What's with your friend there?
TRACY: She's... sick. Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
DUTTON: But you, you've had them.
TRACY: Not tonight. Honest.
DUTTON: If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
TRACY: Look, I'll tell you the truth. Jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but I mean... look at her.
