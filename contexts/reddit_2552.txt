How important is it to you that your job aligns with your values?
The older I get, the more I realize just how important it is to me that my job aligns with my values. Feeling good about the work I'm doing and the purpose behind it has become vital to me. When I was younger, I didn't see it that way because all I was focused on was making money and getting a better title. But now I see that there is so much more to it than that.

Are you currently in a job that aligns with your personal, core values? If not, would you switch careers in order to do something that would be more meaningful and fulfilling for you?
