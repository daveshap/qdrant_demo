Is the shutdown a "canary in a coal mine" for income security and retirement preparedness in the United States?
The continuing partial government shutdown  has highlighted a continuing challenge for the affected government  workers and for American society as a whole - nearly 80% of workers are  living "paycheck to paycheck" ([https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-highlights-that-4-in-5-us-workers-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-highlights-that-4-in-5-us-workers-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html)).   As a corollary, roughly half of U.S. consumers  don’t even have one  month’s savings, and couldn’t handle a single emergency, like an  unexpected transmission repair (or a partial government shutdown) ([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/once-again-americans-are-not-saving-enough-2018-08-28](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/once-again-americans-are-not-saving-enough-2018-08-28)).   And, not only do many Americans not have short-term cash reserves,  they are also unprepared for long-term (retirement) monetary needs ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateashford/2018/02/28/retirement-3/#723d771a6935](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateashford/2018/02/28/retirement-3/#723d771a6935)).   In fact, 35% of American households do not participate in \*any\*  retirement plan and of the 65% that do, the median household has only  $1,100 of retirement funds ([https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/first-quarter-2018/many-americans-still-lack-retirement-savings](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/first-quarter-2018/many-americans-still-lack-retirement-savings)).

Does  the U.S. government have a responsibility to provide a "safety net" for  affected government workers who do not have adequate short-term  reserves to weather the shutdown?

Is  there any bipartisan support for changes in government policy to help  address the lack of both short-term and long-term savings for most  American households?

Are any proposed solutions to the partial government shutdown addressing or commenting on these challenges?
