Will lubuntu 17.10 work as a server? after checking on google for the light weight linux distro, I just started using Lubuntu 17.10. I was thinking, in windows there's a service IIS to make it work like a server in local network. Does Lubuntu have something like that? Does Lubuntu work like server by default or do I have to enable something. By installing 3rd party software like xampp/lamp it may work but do I have to install it really? TIA
