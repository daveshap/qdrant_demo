ATHOS: None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
RAOUL: I care only about Michelle. Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving? I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
ATHOS: Perhaps this will help.
RAOUL: Mother's ring. I can't take this.
ATHOS: She died giving you to me. And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
