Bekenstein Bound This info is from WikipediaIn physics, the Bekenstein bound is an upper limit on the entropy S, or information I, that can be contained within a given finite region of space which has a finite amount of energy\u2014or conversely, the maximum amount of information required to perfectly describe a given physical system down to the quantum level.Upon exceeding the Bekenstein bound a storage medium would collapse into a black hole.This finds parallels with the concept of a kugelblitz, a concentration of light or radiation so intense that its energy forms an event horizon and becomes self-trapped: according to general relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy.My question is is there a known quantity of info or anything that is the limit of Bekenstein Bound or needed to overcome it?
