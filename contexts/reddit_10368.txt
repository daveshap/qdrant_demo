It's not depression, my life objectively sucks
I'm 28, schizophrenic, probably autistic (can't get a diagnosis in Ukraine), live with parents, still a virgin. We are poor, our apartment is falling apart. I used to make music, but not anymore because it gives me insomnia (a weird side effect of schizophrenia medication). My psychiatrist is uncooperative and nasty. 

I have to avoid anything exciting (like music), so I sleep 15 hours a day if I can and browse sad subreddits the rest of the time. Can't focus on TV or books, feel restless because of the pills (a side effect that is more common than my weird music insomnia thing). I can't live like this.
