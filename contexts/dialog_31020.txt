TED: Where are we going?
JULIE: To the best hiding place in the world.
TED: I can't believe your dad built this for you.
JULIE: He didn't. He had it built.
TED: Whatever.
JULIE: Not whatever." It's two different things."
TED: He cared enough to want you to have it.
JULIE: He phoned it in.
TED: I see.
JULIE: I doubt it.
TED: Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
JULIE: The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
TED: You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
JULIE: Your dad taught you everything.
TED: I mean my father.
JULIE: A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
TED: It's all so complicated.
JULIE: It's incredibly simple.
TED: I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
JULIE: Eventually you'll let go.
TED: And then what?
JULIE: Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
TED: You're amazing.
JULIE: I know.
TED: Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
JULIE: But you never do.
TED: If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
JULIE: Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
TED: In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
JULIE: That's two words. And I'm out of the exposed" business
TED: There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
JULIE: You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
TED: He shut down your paper! You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
JULIE: A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
TED: Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
