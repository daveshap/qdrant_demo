MICKEY: When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
GRACE: Yes you are.
MICKEY: What was the color of Tim's belt?
GRACE: The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.
MICKEY: Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
GRACE: Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
MICKEY: Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
GRACE: Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
MICKEY: Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
GRACE: That's what Tim said.
MICKEY: So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
GRACE: Yes, I would.
MICKEY: Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
GRACE: Yes, they were.
MICKEY: That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
GRACE: Yes, you are.
