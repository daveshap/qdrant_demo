MIGUEL: I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
RUSSELL: We should leave too.
MIGUEL: There's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. I think we should follow them.
PHILIP: Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
ALICIA: It's really nice of you to help us.
PHILIP: I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
ALICIA: We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
PHILIP: Cool.
