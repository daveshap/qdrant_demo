My friend has started avoiding me after I said I didnâ€™t like him. What should I do?
I (female) have a friend (male) who has been acting weird around me lately. His mom thought I was dating him since he would come over often to play Call of Duty with me. My mom cleared it up with his mom and made it VERY clear that I do not like him like that. After that, he has started actively avoiding talking to me or sitting near me. He is one of my only friends, and it would be a huge shame to lose him as a friend. What should I do?
