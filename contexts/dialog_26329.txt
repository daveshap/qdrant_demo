ETHAN: There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
SUPERGIRL: What's that?
ETHAN: Let me kiss you.
SUPERGIRL: No.
ETHAN: You're not afraid are you?
SUPERGIRL: Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
ETHAN: If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
SUPERGIRL: Well...I guess one is all right.
SUPERGIRL: Is this how?
ETHAN: Terrific.
