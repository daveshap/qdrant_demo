PEGGY: Who was that man?
MRS. KELCHER: It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
PEGGY: It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
MRS. KELCHER: Would you get that, dear?
PEGGY: Sure, Mom. Hello.
MRS. KELCHER: Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
PEGGY: It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now. I'm sorry, Grandma.
