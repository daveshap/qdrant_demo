Conceptual Question: Best Way to Map Multiple Layers I'm familiar with using QGIS, so this is not a technical question; it's more of a conceptual question. I'm mapping attendance of households at different meetings, and I specifically want to show which meeting or meetings households have attended. I've tried to show this using points, but the map is so large, it makes it look like the meetings haven't had many attendees. (We want to show that the meetings have been well attended.) Instead, I've been using polygons over each house parcel. The issue is that there are households that have been to multiple meetings but the map only shows whatever layer is on the top. I've also tried having the polygons with a line fill, but that didn't work too well. Does anyone have any suggestions for improving this?
