Are China's trade policies unfair to the US, and if so, to what degree are they to blame for US economic problems?
There has been an escalating [war of words between the US and China over trade policies and potential tariffs.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/trump-threatens-tariffs-on-100-billion-more-china-goods-beijing-ready-to-strike-back-idUSKCN1HD0NW)

[This article](https://www.theepochtimes.com/why-trade-with-china-is-not-free_2320640.html) lays out the case for how China's trade policies  have unfairly damaged the US economy and why the tactics of previous US administrations have failed to stem the losses. Among other points, it asserts that since accession to the WTO, China's subsidies, currency manipulation and high tariffs have ballooned the trade deficit and cost millions of American jobs.

On the other hand, economists widely agree that [the benefits of free trade outweigh the costs.](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/free-trade) Previous experiments with trade sanctions have [temporarily preserved small numbers of jobs at a huge cost to US consumers.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-tariffs-has-the-u-s-tried-in-the-past-and-how-did-they-work-out/)

Questions:

* Are China's trade policies widely regarded as "unfair"?
* Have those policies caused the widening trade deficit and/or a decline in US jobs?
* To what degree have China's trade policies affected the wider US economy, both positively and negatively?
