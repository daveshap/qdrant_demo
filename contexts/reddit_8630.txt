What are the ramifications of North Korea "halting nuclear testing", and opening dialogue with South Korea.
It was announced that Kim Jong Un says its ["quest for nuclear weapons is 'complete'"](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/20/asia/north-korea-closes-nuclear-site/index.html), and have begun diplomatic engagement with South Korea and the US. What is the motivation in such a statement, and why now? More specifically, what does NK have to gain from this, or is it just for show?
