DR. LECTER: Your bleeding has stopped.
CLARICE: How did - It's nothing. A scratch.
DR. LECTER: Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
CLARICE: Why? Do you know something about him?
DR. LECTER: I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
CLARICE: Why don't you tell me about Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?"
DR. LECTER: His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under Missing Person" - which
CLARICE: If you didn't kill him, then who did?
DR. LECTER: Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
CLARICE: Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
DR. LECTER: And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own. How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
CLARICE: Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
DR. LECTER: Ahhh... Why?
CLARICE: Because you weren't wasting my time.
DR. LECTER: Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
CLARICE: I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
DR. LECTER: Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
CLARICE: I never thought about it.
DR. LECTER: Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
CLARICE: That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
DR. LECTER: Not anymore. Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
CLARICE: I don't know. Is it?
DR. LECTER: Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
DR. LECTER: Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
CLARICE: Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
DR. LECTER: I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
CLARICE: Who killed your patient?
DR. LECTER: Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
CLARICE: Buffalo Bill...? Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
