DEREK: What can I do for you guys?
GEORGE: We want some grass.
DEREK: I know what you want. But, first of all, are you cops?
GEORGE: No.
DEREK: Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
GEORGE: We're not cops. We're from Massachusettes. I mean, does he look like a cop?
DEREK: I guess not. Okay. You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
GEORGE: What the fuck is that?
DEREK: It's your grass.
