How many files are created by default using WiredTiger storage engine? So, I got a question on a test (without answer unfortunately) that left me with a big doubt whether it's true or false.The question is this: \"By default, WiredTiger storage engine creates one file per collection and per index\".I went to check all the documentation, but I couldn't find a really satisfying answer to this question. I would assume by logic that it of course creates one file per collection and one per index, but how to be sure about that? I think those files are managed by the DB system and thus are not visible to the user.I just remember that somewhere there are the files of the database looking like dbname.0 and when it grows after a certain threshold, it creates another file dbname.1 etc. so I would assume the collection is inside that file and not a separate entity, thus making the test statement wrong?
