DEIRDRE: Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
SAM: You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
DEIRDRE: I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to. when I was a - Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with. You know: any man who needed setting up. Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed. Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam. To most of the men I with I was always the girl. Send the girl to do it." "Tell The girl to take care of it." "Have the girl fuck him." But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more
SAM: You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
DEIRDRE: Exactly. And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
DEIRDRE: I better be getting that.
SAM: Duty calls?
DEIRDRE: Just business.
DEIRDRE: Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we? What's your job?
GREGOR: I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target. I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
DEIRDRE: Next.
LARRY: You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
DEIRDRE: Which leads us to...
SWEDE: I ride with fat-boy...
LARRY: Eat shit and die slowly...
SWEDE: After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
LARRY: I blast the lead car into oblivion...
VINCENT: While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
DEIRDRE: Leaving...
