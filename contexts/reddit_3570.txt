Texts like this hit me in the feels

I’m trying to date this woman.  We’ve been texting to set up a meeting for this weekend.  I texted her saying that I’d be fine doing something simple like lunch, because I just want to spend time being with her.  

She texted back reciprocating... and it made my heart do the thing.  We’re not “in a relationship” yet, but I’m excited to see where this goes.

Not a question.  Just a bit of a celebration that things are going well in the dating front.

edit; note to any ladies reading this.  if you want to make your man melt, call him 'meaningful'

edit.  we've been talking for a bit over a month.  we've had two in person dates so far, and things seem to click between us.
