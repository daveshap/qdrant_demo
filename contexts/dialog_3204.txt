MARTHA: Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
BEAVIS: Yeah, we're gonna score.
MARTHA: I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
BEAVIS: Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
MARTHA: Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
BEAVIS: Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
BUTT-HEAD: Cool. Huh huh huh.
MARTHA: It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
BEAVIS: Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
MARTHA: Oh, that's nice.
