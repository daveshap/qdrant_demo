MRS. WOLFE: Are you my two o'clock?
BATEMAN: No.
MRS. WOLFE: Can I help you?
BATEMAN: I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
BATEMAN: Doesn't he live here?
MRS. WOLFE: No, he doesn't.
BATEMAN: Are you sure?
MRS. WOLFE: You saw the ad in the Times?
BATEMAN: No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
MRS. WOLFE: There was no ad in the Times.
MRS. WOLFE: I think you should go now.
BATEMAN: But I think...I want to know what happened here.
MRS. WOLFE: Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
MRS. WOLFE: Don't come back.
BATEMAN: I won't...don't worry.
