I DO NOT WANT YOUR GOOD MORNING TEXTS
Its so annoying when I’m talking to a guy I’ve just matched with on an app and a day or two into the conversation he starts sending those good morning cutesy texts. No. Don’t. I don’t want to be cutesy with a stranger and frankly, I’m not super invested yet. We haven’t even met. Sorry to be harsh but it just grinds my gears. It’s such a turn off. Does anyone else feel that way?

Idk maybe I’m just gay...but that’s for another post lol
