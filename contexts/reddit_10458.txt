I am ending my life tonight
Tonight, I’m finally ending it all after 21 years of living.  I was neglected by my mother when I was an infant, her neglect and inattentiveness led to me being sexually abused by my caretaker. This has led to many psychological problems such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, OCD and borderline personality disorder. I have wanted to die since I was 6 years old. I see no hope in living anymore. 

I ruin all my relationships. The love of my life broke up with me a month ago. In a state of despair, I hooked up with random men to fill the void. My ex said he would never get back together with me if I slept with other people. I see no point in living. I’m an abusive pile of shit who isn’t capable of being loved because I hurt the people I love most. I have been in therapy for years and I continue to be a fucking monster. 

I ordered refills for medication I have been hoarding. Tonight, I’m going to drive to a place that was special to my ex and I. I am going to end it all tonight. There’s no point in living if my brain will never be fixed. There’s no point in being alive if I’m a terrible human being who never even had a chance. This is my last goodbye.
