Is it possible to securely connect 20AWG wire to CR2 battery terminals? I\u2019m trying to securely connect a positive and negative 20 AWG thickness wire to each terminal of a CR2 battery.From what I understand, they don\u2019t make terminal connectors for these types of batteries as the negative end is flat and positive end has a nub like most small consumer batteries. For the time being, I am wrapping electrical tape around each end of the battery to hold the wires in place.I am aware that this is only a temporary solution and would like something that would be much more secure. Any suggestions/tips would be greatly appreciated!
