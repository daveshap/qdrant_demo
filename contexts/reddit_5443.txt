Any certifications that can be completed during this quarantine/ social isolation time?
Hey all!
I'm currently in between jobs and since it seems I'll be off for the rest of the summer due to the whole quarantine situation I was wondering if there are any certifications or training out there that could be completed during this time.  Preferably free but I won't mind paying if it's a good one.

Thanks in advance !
