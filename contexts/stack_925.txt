How can one have a little music track listing that can drop down from an indicator applet? I wanna play my sweet sweet slow jams but I ain't got no track listing in my VLC indicator applet drop-down in Unity on 16.04! Friendos, in all of this green and blue planet, how might this me done?EDIT: When I try using the speaker drop-down menu with Rhythmbox, I don't see a track listing, only controls. I need to see like a listing of maybe 6 or so tracks, like 3 just played and 3 upcoming, something like that.
