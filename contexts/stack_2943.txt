COM frame in Relativistic particle physics I have a home work:<blockquote>  Consider a head-on collision of a 'bullet' of rest mass $M$ with a stationary 'target' of rest mass $m$. Prove that the post-collision \u03b3-factor of the bullet cannot exceed:$$(m^2 + M^2)/(2mM).$$   [Hint: if $P, P'$ are the pre- and post- collision four-momenta of the bullet, and $Q, Q'$ those of the target,show, by going to the CM frame, that $(P' \u2212 Q)^2 \u2265 0$; in fact, in the CM frame $P' \u2212 Q$ has no spatial components.] </blockquote>I have solved problem from the hint that $(P' \u2212 Q)^2 \u2265 0$ and $P' \u2212 Q$ should have non-spatial component.The first hint is easy, because four-momentum is time-like hence it should always be non-negative. What i don't understand is that why $P' \u2212 Q$ should have non-spatial component in COM?
