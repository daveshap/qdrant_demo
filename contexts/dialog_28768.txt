COOCH: This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
RAY: -- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
COOCH: We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
RAY: We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
COOCH: No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
