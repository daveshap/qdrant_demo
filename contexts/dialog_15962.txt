TONY: Have you ever been in Messina, son?
RINALDI: Yes... Twice.
TONY: Did you fish in Messina? The pesce spada"?"
RINALDI: No...
TONY: It's a specialty down there. It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
