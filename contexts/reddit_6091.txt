Temporarily laid off yet still being asked to work.
I work in design and sales in residential construction and about 6 weeks ago was laid off temporarily due to a lack of business. Unfortunately we still have ongoing projects (some of which I was heavily involved in) and I am now being contacted daily by my employer and sub contractors with questions and problems. My supervisor even asked me to visit a job site yesterday to inspect the progress. I told him I was taking the health warnings seriously and wont leave my home unless its essential.

I dont like the situation at all. My nerves are on edge all of the time and my stress shoots up once I hear my phone ring. I'm expecting more calls today and I'm not sure what to do. They've told me to record my hours and they will compensate me when I return but to be honest I'm skeptical of that and even so ... the 10-15 minutes I work on the phone is not worth the interruption or the stress. 

I'm the only person in our small company that can answer alot of these questions and so I worry about bringing up my problems with it. I think it could have a negative impact on my reputation and also affect my references further down the line, not to mention the clients who I might be letting down by refusing to assist.

Has anybody found themself in a similar situation? Any advice?
