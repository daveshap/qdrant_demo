DAD: Son ... are you awake?
JIMMY: Yes.
DAD: We're going to be moving, son.
JIMMY: Do we have to?
DAD: I know, son. But you'll like it where we're going. I'm getting a good job. It's a pretty part of the country.
JIMMY: I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
DAD: You'll meet new friends. I know ... it's rough. But I have to move, son.
