I just realised that people don't really care about my mental health. They just care that I'm not a whining bitch anymore.
Ive learned how to supress my emotions. No more crying. No more screaming at the top of my lungs when I'm in pain. No more hitting myself when I'm angry. No more panic attacks in front of others. I'm still in just as much hurt as I was before, now I just know nobody wants to deal with my bullshit. 

And you know what? Fair. Not even I wanna deal with my bullshit. But at least don't act like you do care when you don't. Nobody tried to help me solve my problems. They pretended they did. All they did was get me to a point where my problems were no longer anyone else's problems and called that me "getting better." Despite the fact that I am very visibily just as equally as bad as I was before. 

I swear this is just even more proof I'm seriously just a burden. My silence has seemed to drastically improve the lives of those around me. So imagine what literally just not existing could do.
