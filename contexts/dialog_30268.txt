DONEGHY: You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are...?
GALVIN: Hold on a second.
DONEGHY: I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
GALVIN: It's all right, Mickey.
DONEGHY: You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours... You don't have to go out there to see that girl. We been going four years. Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
GALVIN: I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
DONEGHY: What you thought!? What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
GALVIN: I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
DONEGHY: You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
GALVIN: If I could accept the offer right now, I would. They took it back.
DONEGHY: I understand. I went to the Bar Association. They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
MICKEY: Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
LAURA: How'm I doing so far?
MICKEY: So far you're great. You got a cigarette?
