My girlfriend has a lot of guy friends, and I feel uncomfortable for some reason
First of all, I just want to say that I know it's wrong to say that she shouldn't have any guy friends. Also, this isn't what I'm saying. I'm just saying I don't like the way she talks to all her guy friends so regularly. 

Basically, she has a ton of guy friends. Like, a ton. And I don't know any of them. They're all either from her work or from her old schools. She texts them a lot, really regularly. As well, her female friends text these guys from her phone. So one of her friends might use the phone to hit on the guys, without the guys realizing it's someone else. That's worded kind of confusingly - basically, a friend will text a guy using my girlfriend's phone. The friend will call the guy 'sexy' or something, without telling the guy it isn't my girlfriend. So the guy will think my girlfriend is calling him sexy. 

Also, I feel uncomfortable with her talking to all these guys because they're either her exes, or at some point have had a crush on her. Each one has confessed their attraction to her, and she's turned them down. That hasn't stopped her talking to them, though, and they're accidentally being led on by her friends. I just really wish she wouldn't talk to them quite like that. Another thing is, when talking to her friends about them, she'll call them sexy and hot. Like, right while I'm there. It doesn't really help my self esteem. 

I'd love some advice on how to change my opinion on this. I don't want to make her stop being friends with anyone, I just wish I didn't feel so uncomfortable with this. Thanks in advance.

Also, as a sidenote, her lesbian friend makes advances on her all the time. They both joke about it, but I don't really like how this girl can do inappropriate things and pass it off as a joke. Plus, she totally hates my guts. Like, she will give me a death stare any time my girlfriend isn't looking.
