I drove to the gun store , parked , and drove back home
Was having such a hard time with depression. I made the decision I was going to go to the gun store and kill myself the next day (last night). Woke up , took a shower , got dressed and built up the courage to go... I got in the car and put the nearest gun shop in my gps. Not playing any music whatsoever on my ride there, total silence for the 13 minute drive. Mind racing 300mph. I parked next to the store and was trembling with fear , there it was the gun store. I tried to unlock my seatbelt and my hand was shaking. I was able to unlock my seatbelt , but that was it. I didn’t have the strength to get out the car and go inside. I ended up crying and calling my cousin asking if i could spend a few days at his house because I’m at a low point and I live all by myself. He said of course and so i turned the car back on drove back home packed a bag and headed to his house . I’m here at his house now and we just got dinner with his kids. I still feel like utter shit and want to die but something in me wouldn’t let me pull the trigger ( no pun intended). A small voice in my head is proud of me ..... but I’m still fighting this war of suicidal ideation and depression constantly and I feel like I’m losing . Just had to share with Someone.
