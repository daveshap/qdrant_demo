HOOKER: Twist? I told him the tale. He wants to see ya.
TWIST: All right, when?
HOOKER: Tomorrow, after 4:00. Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya. And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
TWIST: Okay, Tootsie.
GONDORFF: Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
HOOKER: I thought I'd lost him.
GONDORFF: Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
HOOKER: Nothin'. I told ya everything there is.
GONDORFF: Then why'd ya move outa your room?
HOOKER: It was too noisy.
GONDORFF: You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
GONDORFF: You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
HOOKER: All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
GONDORFF: You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet. You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains. And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
HOOKER: A couple days; that's all I'm askin'. I can stay clear that long.
GONDORFF: Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
LORETTA: You done?
HOOKER: Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
LORETTA: It isn't any better.
HOOKER: Where's June today?
LORETTA: She don't work here no more. I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
HOOKER: Where you goin'?
LORETTA: I don't know. Depends what train I get on.
