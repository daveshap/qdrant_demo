How valuable is PTO to you?
I know this is ultimately a personal decision but would love some opinions. 

I have a job offer with 21 days PTO (including holidays but not sick time) and my current job has 47 days (also including holidays but not sick time).

The new job is in a better city - warmer, more things to do, etc. It definitely seems like a great fit for me lifestyle wise, but my current job is close to family whereas the new one is a 5 hour connecting flight away.

My husband and I want to start a family soon so it seems crazy to give up all that PTO ...26 days difference - over a month more time to live life instead of be in a 9-5 office. 

I think I know the answer already.... I just feel so trapped by this awesome benefit! No companies I look at are even close. Oh also salary is only marginally more, not enough to make a difference.
