What are the pros and cons of Scotland becoming part of Canada?
[The BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39510351) is reporting on [a proposal](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/its-time-for-scotland-to-find-a-new-home-in-canada/article34583830/) that Canada should invite Scotland to become a Canadian province.

The proposal states that Scotland could be given an arrangement similar to that between Quebec and Canada. Quebec has a bit more independence than other provinces, having [its own immigration programs](http://www.immigration.ca/quebec-immigration-overview/) and [international relations ministry.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_International_Relations_\(Quebec\))

What are the pros and cons of this proposal?  What would need to be done to effectuate it under the constitutional laws of Canada and the United Kingdom?
