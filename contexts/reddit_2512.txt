Why does office culture like to drink so much?
I can't possibly fathom why. But every culture of office I worked for, loves to drink. And generally it seems after a long hard work day or week, people go to the bars, or drink, or buy alcohol. Popular mainstream has also conditioned us to drink. But what is it about drinking that people like? It burns, it tastes awful, and it's expensive. Why would you do any of those combinations solo, let alone combined. Where is the correlation of a long hard work day and a beer involved?
