BRIMMER: Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
JUDGE: What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
BRIMMER: I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
JUDGE: Brimmer you're fucked up...
BRIMMER: Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
JUDGE: Who's they?
BRIMMER: Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
JUDGE: Who? I mean besides the FBI?
BRIMMER: I don't know. Except, it's one of you. Maybe not a Panther, but it's someone from the neighborhood. Judge. Look, just go. Get away. It's over. You lost. We all lost.
