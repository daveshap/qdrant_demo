SYKES: Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with his hands in his back pockets.
WINTER: You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
SYKES: Yeah.
WINTER: Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
SYKES: Lucky nothing. I had to empty my damn gun into him.
WINTER: That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
WINTER: Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one. We're just about to start cutting in. You're welcome to stick around if you want. It's really fascinating stuff.
SYKES: Yeah, I'll bet.
SYKES: What's this? What's going on?
JETSON: Nothing.
SYKES: Nothing?
JETSON: Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
JETSON: What is this?
SYKES: A rubber. A condom. You know... Coney Island whitefish? Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies. You need this for anything?
