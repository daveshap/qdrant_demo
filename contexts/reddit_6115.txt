What's the most absurd/bad thing your employer has told you during the covid-19 lock down?
I was lucky and it was business as usual where I work, apart from everyone working remotely.However, a friend of mine got fired and just got the papers via courier and some other people I know were told "when people work remotely, they only work for 4 hours so you're going part time". Has anything similar happened to you during this pandemic?
