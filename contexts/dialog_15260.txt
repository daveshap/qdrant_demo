MISHA: How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
TELLY: You think so?
MISHA: Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
TELLY: He still does.
MISHA: I hate 'em.
TELLY: It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
MISHA: Yeah?
TELLY: You've heard the stories right?
MISHA: No.
