Searching source of Malware in Chromium extensions I installed chromium for Ubuntu. Last night when I opened it up I got some freaky malware thing, warning me to redirect myself somewhere. It occurred not long after I added some extensions from the chromium store, so I'm guessing it might have come with one of them. So I removed chromium. Knowing that I'm completely computer illiterate, (so please go easy on me),;If I reinstall chromium again,will all the add ons still be there? ie the apps and extensions?If so,should I just delete them all, or are there steps I should/could take to see if there is a bug in them?
