Common collector effect of emitter resistor on output impedance I've been trying to figure out why the expression for output impedance in a common collector configuration contains a parallel Re emitter resistor.Looking at the classic circuit, it looks as though the Re resistor is not part of the seen output impedance (similar to the way it isn't in a common emitter configuration)I'm a rather elderly person who has decided to take on myself to self-study analog electronics - so I would appreciate if someone more experienced and knowledgeable could enlighten me about this issue.Thanks,   Sefer.
