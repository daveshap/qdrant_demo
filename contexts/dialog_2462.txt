JENNIFER: Brian.
BRIAN: Jennifer.
JENNIFER: You're back.
BRIAN: You look great.
JENNIFER: Thanks for calling.
BRIAN: Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
JENNIFER: Huh.
BRIAN: So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
JENNIFER: Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
BRIAN: Yeah? What have you been up to?
JENNIFER: I work for city hall.
BRIAN: Really? No kidding.
JENNIFER: What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
