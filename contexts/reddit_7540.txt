I got all A’s!!!!
Long story short, my first year of grad school was...intense, to put it mildly. I’m pursuing a Masters in Food Science having absolutely NO science-ing experience. I was going back to school after about 15 years and had been a creative artist my whole life. Always performed terribly in science and math and have moderate test anxiety. But, I was assured by my program director that I would do fine. 

Last year, I thought I had reached my final mental breaking point and if you know me, you know I’m a tough cookie, so that’s saying a lot. By some miracle I pulled B’s out of my ass for my final grades. Even after getting D’s on some of my finals. 

This year, first term back. Dreaded Microbiology and Chemistry. Took my finals on Wednesday, felt ok. I GOT ALL A’s!!!! I earned 93-98’s in all my courses. I still can’t believe it. I’ve never been a good student or felt smart in any way. I’ve always admired studious “left-brained” people and now I feel like one of them. 

Side note: I also thought I wouldn’t be graduating till December 2020, but I found out I’ll be done in 6 months!!!

TL;DR: Last year sucked. This year is way better!
