How Will the GOP Tax Bill Affect the Economy and the Lower/Middle Class?
This [CNN article](http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/16/news/economy/house-tax-bill-vote/index.html) goes through how the bill will affect individuals and corporations. It seems the most talked about provisions of the bill are reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, creating 4 tax brackets, eliminating the estate tax, as well as changing several deductions and credits. While the Senate and House Republicans claim the bill will grow the GDP and help the economy and taxpayers, Democrats call it a "tax cut for the rich," [criticize what the bill will do to helath care](http://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/363966-for-the-benefit-of-our-children-congress-must-reject-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs), and claim that the bill will grow the debt. 

This bill is very complicated and will obvioulsy have some winners and some loosers. Overall, will the bill have a positive or negative affect on the economy and the middle and lower classes?
