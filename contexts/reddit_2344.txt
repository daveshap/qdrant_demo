Anyone just glad to get out of high school?
For me, high school has been the most miserable years of my life. It was just constantly comparing myself to people who did better than me, whether it be academically or in extracurriculars. To top it off, I didn't really have longstanding best friends, and what little friends I did have basically treated me like trash and I felt like I played second fiddle to everybody else. One of my friends even tried to apologize to me for treating me like a piece of trash or just a backup friend for so long but it doesn't fucking matter. I just wanna leave high school. Hell, if I see my HS friends at uni, I might just retch.
