Transitioning into professional workforce
Hi friends,

Is anyone else struggling with imposter syndrome relevant to applying for professional work? I'm graduating with my Master's in May, and when I think about applying to jobs, I'm excited---but also scared out of my mind that I'm not actually qualified, or that I'll get hired but fail terribly, etc.

Rationally, I know it's just anxiety, but it's pretty overwhelming. I couldn't find community anywhere else, so I wondered if any of you could relate.
