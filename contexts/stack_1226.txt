Design star schema for relatonal database I'm a newbie to data warehousing and I've been reading articles and watching videos on the principles but I'm a bit confused as to how I would take the design below and convert it into a star schema.in this example i assume that the fact table is (order-orderitem-book)And the measures is (category-customer-time)My question is about book author how can we put is as measure? Is it allowed to put many to many relationship in star schema ?? And if i am wrong how to draw star schema to this relatonal db?
