Exporting GeoTIFFs from QGIS I would like to export my map as a GeoTIFF in QGIS. My workflow is as follows: Project - Import/export - export map to image\u2026I have two questions about this: instead of saving the image as a GeoTIFF, QGIS saves it as a normal TIFF file and a world-file. How can I export it as a single GeoTIFF?Also, when I re-import the image into QGIS, it returns the error message that the coordinate system is not defined. How can I export the image correctly with the coordinate system, which I had put for the map?
