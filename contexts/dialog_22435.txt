STEVE: Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
CLAY: I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
STEVE: Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
CLAY: You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
STEVE: Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
CLAY: That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
STEVE: Oh... that's the time you went away.
CLAY: I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
STEVE: Maybe you shoulda killed him.
CLAY: Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder. Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
STEVE: Yeah, it does.
CLAY: But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
