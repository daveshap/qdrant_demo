New job - correct way to update Linkedin?
I'm in the first week of work with a job title that includes the word "Student" (let's say, for the sake of anonymity, that the job title is "Student Office Assistant"). This is because it's designed to be flexible and part-time so that someone who is studying can work there at the same time. However, being a student is not actually a requirement; I am a graduate.

I feel it may be confusing to others if I update my Linkedin to being a "Student Office Assistant" when I'm not actually a student. But at the same time, it might seem wrong to change my job title to one that I don't actually have.

As a compromise, I was considering putting in my full job title under the experience section ("Student Office Assistant - Amazon). And then, for the headline, I could write "Office Assistant at Amazon". Does that seem reasonable?
