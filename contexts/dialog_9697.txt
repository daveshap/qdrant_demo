TITA: Oh my goodness... Bobby...
BOBBY: Hi, Tita.
TITA: Robert Eroica...
BOBBY: Now don't...
TITA: No, I'm not... I'm not.
BOBBY: That's good.
TITA: I just can't look at you.
BOBBY: Don't, then.
TITA: You always do this to me.
BOBBY: Well, I don't mean to. Here's your tea, Tita.
TITA: Thank you... Oh no, don't put it on there...
BOBBY: Sorry.
TITA: This is a very special, very old CB 275...
BOBBY: Oh.
TITA: You know who it once belonged to?
BOBBY: No.
TITA: Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
BOBBY: No kidding.
