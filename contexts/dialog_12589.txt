ROB: Nice, Barry.
BARRY: Rob. Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's. Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins? Is it better to burn out than to fade away?""
ROB: You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
BARRY: We didn't even really have it. I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight
ROB: Not the point.
BARRY: Oh, so what's the point then?
ROB: I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
BARRY: Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?"
ROB: Barry, I'm fucking broke! I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
BARRY: Bullshit. The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway. Why not have a little fun? Big fucking deal.
ROB: What did he ever do to you?
BARRY: He offended me with his terrible taste.
ROB: It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
BARRY: Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker? You're going soft in your old age, Rob. There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street. Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy. You're right, Rob. I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
