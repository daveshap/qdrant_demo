Following-Up On a Verbal Job Offer - Need Advice
Back in March, I interviewed for a job and four days later they called and verbally offered me the job which I accepted. My start date at the time was TBD, because the day they offered me the job, they said they were temporarily closing their office and furloughing some of their administrative employees. About two days after this NJ (where I live and where this job is located) issued their stay at home order, which is still in effect.

I only heard from the manager responsible for hiring for this job once since then, and am planning on trying to reach out again. I just sent him an email and if I do not hear back I am going to call.

I was wondering how long after the email should I follow-up with a call if I haven't heard back from my email? Also, any other tips you can give over how to approach this would be greatly appreciated!
