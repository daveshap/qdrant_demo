I'm experiencing a lot of harassment on my campus lately from political canvassers looking for donations
I'm getting really frustrated with this and don't know if there's even anything I can do, or who on campus I would contact about this. Lately it seems like I can barely walk from one class to another without a canvasser interrupting me and demanding my time. 

It always ends the same way if you listen to their spiel; they want money for Greenpeace, ACLU, or whatever organization they're with. Today one of the canvassers almost pushed me to my breaking point by making a rude comment when I politely said I didn't have time and tried to walk past them, meant to make me feel guilty for not giving them a donation. I basically depleted my life savings to go back to school and am so broke, I can barely afford to buy food and pay my utilities right now. I was so ashamed, I went to the library and cried and have been in a bad mood all day. 

Some of these people are so aggressive and disrespectful and I'm sick of having to either put up with this or waste valuable study time by taking long routes around campus to avoid them. What can I do to get them to back off?
