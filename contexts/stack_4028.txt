OLS regression for not normally distributed data? In a college course I try to measure the abnormal returns (the returns that are below or over the returns of the market) of a companies stock after a specific event based on linear OLS regression. When interpreting the results with t-statistic and corresponding p-value, the professor of the course told me that these abnormal returns I observe have to be normally distributed. Otherwise the t-test would lead to miss specified results. If I am not mistaken, OLS assumes the normal distribution of the error terms. Unfortunately I don\u2019t really get why the effect I would like to observe has to be normally distributed in order to get unbiased results. What Problems arise when the data i observe are not normally distriuted? Do I have to work with approach in this case (not OLS regression)?Thanks in advance
