People should stop using “stoicism” as an excuse for emotional unavailability.
This grinds my reels so much. “My daddy didn’t hug me enough so imma have trouble emoting like a normal human being.. here look at me make a straight face while you try to humor me, I’m just a stoic” NO. You’re emotionally stunted that’s it’s. stoicism is rational emotional response ; not lack of emotional response. 

Jesus! Lot of us grew up in broken homes, heck some of us were thrashed growing up. We didn’t turn out to be complete jackasses who cannot appreciate other humans being nice, neither did we take up after the gross misdemeanour of our parents. 

“Stoicism” to men in their mid-20s is what emo is to teenagers. Im so so done.
