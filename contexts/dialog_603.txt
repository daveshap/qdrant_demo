MARTHA: An unhappy woman...
MOTHER MIRIAM: She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
MARTHA: Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Because I am a moral person.
MARTHA: Bullshit!
MOTHER MIRIAM: Bullshit yourself!
MARTHA: Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
MARTHA: You just said...
MOTHER MIRIAM: What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
MARTHA: Nothing...
MOTHER MIRIAM: What have we done to hurt you? And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do? Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
MARTHA: It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said? She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Stupid woman... and that's all?
MARTHA: That's all? That's enough! She was a beautiful little girl.
MOTHER MIRIAM: And what has that to do with it?
MARTHA: I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me? I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
MOTHER MIRIAM: So you left the Church because you had freckles?
MARTHA: No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
