I got pulled over for the first time. I'm going to be sick.
So, I realize this is rather inconsequential on a grand scale, but I feel awful and I need to talk to someone.

 I was driving to a babysitting job this afternoon, around ~5:15. I am going down a road that is usually deserted. I imagine I was going about ten-ish miles over the speed limit, but I don't know at this point because the experience freaks me out in my head. I am running late to a baby sitting job. 

Then suddenly... A wild police car appears coming from the opposite direction! Fuck. I hit the breaks, but appearantly he has already seen me. I am about to head in to a set of dangerous curves, so I have no choice to but to continue driving for roughly another half mile until I pull in to a post office. 

I am 16. This is the first time I have been puller over. In my state, a ticket could mean a suspended lisecene till 18. So the officer pulls me over, and asks to see my license. I give it to him, and he recognizes my name. 

He asks if my dad is a doctor down at the hospital. He is. For the record, he is also SWAT and occasionally fire department. So he asks me to call my dad and let him talk to him. So I call him, and the officer tells him I was speeding, and then he tells my dad that "he can't prove it but I think that she sped up when she saw me turn my lights on". 

Which is ridiculous because what kind of sense does that make? So he lets me go with a warning thankfully, and I make my way to my baby sitting job. I then call my dad, and we talk. He believes me when I say I in no way sped away, and that we'd talk about it when I got home. I will be home is roughly two hours. 

I am so anxious and nervous I think I'm going to vomit. I don't want to talk to anyone I know because I'm so horribly embarrassed. So, on the off chance the two people I know in real life check my account, pretend this doesn't exist!
