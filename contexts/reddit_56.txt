Should I try it?
Okay, i’ve been crying more and more lately, which I feel like I do for no reason at all.. I keep reminding myself that i’d never have as much friends as the other people beside me, which just causes me to cry. I feel like it’s my fault that I did this to myself and never tried to change. I’m thinking about cutting myself. No, not the really open wound with so much blood spewing out. but just a mild cut that it doesn’t look like I did it intentionally. It feels so tempting, yet so shameful at the same time..
