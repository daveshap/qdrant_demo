How does Congress approve funding for specific projects by organizations like the CIA?
Reposting with a few sources this time,

I am not sure if I am asking in the correct subreddit. I was debating on asking this question here or on /r/AskHistorians. But to me, it seemed more of a political question than a historical one.

In Steve Coll's book, "Ghost Wars", there are multiple instances of Congress debating on increasing or cutting the CIA's funding toward the fighting between the Soviets and the mujahedin fighters in Afghanistan in early 70s and 80s. Seemingly all without the public knowing at the time.

One example of a politician mentioned is Charlie Wilson [[1](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Charlie_Wilson_\(Texas_politician)], a former US House Representative from Texas. 
In Chapter 5 of the Ghost Wars[[2](https://books.google.com/books?id=N8Qxf-33dxMC&pg=PT111&dq=Beginning+in+1984,+Wilson+began+to+force+more+money+and+more+sophisticated+weapons+systems+into+the+CIA%E2%80%99s+classified+Afghan+budget,+even+when+Langley+wasn%E2%80%99t+interested.+Goaded+by+small+but+passionate+anticommunist+lobbies+in+Washington,+Wilson+argued+that+the+CIA%E2%80%99s+lukewarm+attitude+toward+the+jihad,+exemplified+by+McMahon,+amounted+to+a+policy+of+fighting+the+Soviets+%E2%80%9Cto+the+last+Afghan.%E2%80%9D+The+agency+was+sending+just+enough+weaponry+to+ensure+that+many+brave+Afghan+rebels+died+violently+in+battle,+but+not+enough+to+help+them+win.+As+a+resolution+pushed+through+Congress+by+Wilson+put+it,+%E2%80%9CIt+would+be+indefensible+to+provide+the+freedom+fighters+with+only+enough+aid+to+fight+and+die,+but+not+enough+to+advance+their+cause+of+freedom.%E2%80%9D+He+told+congressional+committee+members+on+the+eve+of+one+crucial+funding+vote:+%E2%80%9CThe+U.S.+had+nothing+whatsoever+to+do+with+these+people%E2%80%99s+decision+to+fight.+They+made+this+decision+on+Christmas+Eve+and+they%E2%80%99re+going+to+fight+to+the+last,+even+if+they+have+to+fight+with+stones.+But+we%E2%80%99ll+be+damned+by+history+if+we+let+them+fight+with+stones&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3hpPs3OTVAhUCPiYKHWAODfwQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=Beginning%20in%201984%2C%20Wilson%20began%20to%20force%20more%20money%20and%20more%20sophisticated%20weapons%20systems%20into%20the%20CIA%E2%80%99s%20classified%20Afghan%20budget%2C%20even%20when%20Langley%20wasn%E2%80%99t%20interested.%20Goaded%20by%20small%20but%20passionate%20anticommunist%20lobbies%20in%20Washington%2C%20Wilson%20argued%20that%20the%20CIA%E2%80%99s%20lukewarm%20attitude%20toward%20the%20jihad%2C%20exemplified%20by%20McMahon%2C%20amounted%20to%20a%20policy%20of%20fighting%20the%20Soviets%20%E2%80%9Cto%20the%20last%20Afghan.%E2%80%9D%20The%20agency%20was%20sending%20just%20enough%20weaponry%20to%20ensure%20that%20many%20brave%20Afghan%20rebels%20died%20violently%20in%20battle%2C%20but%20not%20enough%20to%20help%20them%20win.%20As%20a%20resolution%20pushed%20through%20Congress%20by%20Wilson%20put%20it%2C%20%E2%80%9CIt%20would%20be%20indefensible%20to%20provide%20the%20freedom%20fighters%20with%20only%20enough%20aid%20to%20fight%20and%20die%2C%20but%20not%20enough%20to%20advance%20their%20cause%20of%20freedom.%E2%80%9D%20He%20told%20congressional%20committee%20members%20on%20the%20eve%20of%20one%20crucial%20funding%20vote%3A%20%E2%80%9CThe%20U.S.%20had%20nothing%20whatsoever%20to%20do%20with%20these%20people%E2%80%99s%20decision%20to%20fight.%20They%20made%20this%20decision%20on%20Christmas%20Eve%20and%20they%E2%80%99re%20going%20to%20fight%20to%20the%20last%2C%20even%20if%20they%20have%20to%20fight%20with%20stones.%20But%20we%E2%80%99ll%20be%20damned%20by%20history%20if%20we%20let%20them%20fight%20with%20stones&f=false)], Steve Coll talks about how Representative Wilson lobbied frequently for more financial aid to the mujahedin. Steve Coll makes a quick mention about how Representative Wilson convinced an unspecified committee during a particular crucial funding vote. 

My questions are whom in Congress gets to approve this kind of funding? And what measures, if any, does Congress take to prevent the media from discovering these votes?

While I am particularly interested in this specific time period of US history, if someone has a great example from a different time period and/or involving a completely different secret project, I still love to hear about that as long as it addresses my questions about congressional involvement. 


Thanks in advance.
