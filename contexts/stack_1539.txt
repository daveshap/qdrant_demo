The fields and waves associated with a transformer Induction in a transformer happens via a fluctuating magnetic field in coil A inducing a voltage and hence current in coil B. An electric field is associated with a fluctuating magnetic field. Is the electric field at right angles to the magnetic flux lines?Is this magnetic field actually an electromagnetic wave? What part, if any, do electromagnetic waves/fields have in the operation of a transformer? Do electromagnetic waves travel down the wire?
