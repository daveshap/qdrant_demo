After a year of unemployment, I found a job!
After a year of unemployment, and at age 39, I wondered if anyone would ever be willing to hire someone like me.  Thankfully, someone did.  Even though I have huge jobs gaps in my resume, even though I am terrible at interviews, and even though I have had significant failures in my career... I finally found job.  You never know when your luck might change.  Don't give up hope, my friends.  My job offer came about 15 minutes before I had another phone interview with another company.  Treat a job search like a full time job, and the hard work will pay off.
