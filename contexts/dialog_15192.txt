BRIAN: ...I do.
CARRIE: Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.

CARRIE: No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
BRIAN: ...just like that?
CARRIE: Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
