Sort of boyfriend maybe sort of breaking up with me.
I met a guy in January, and we started off just hooking up now and then. We quickly became friends with benefits. And by the beginning of April we were best friends and pretty serious about being with each other. We both left university for summer break in May, and haven't seen each other in person since. We live 1000 miles apart. We text/e-mail/video chat with a rough estimate of 4 hours worth of communication each day. He's been going back and forth between coming back to our university or staying in his home state. My heart has broken each time he decided to stay there, and I've rejoiced each time he decided to return. I'm getting some serious whiplash. Today tuition is due at 4pm, and if he does nothing about it, he has no choice but to stay at home. He has yet to make a final decision. I've been trying to back off and let him make up his own mind. Giving honest opinions of each option (setting my emotions aside I think he should stay there). I want to just leave him alone today so he can think. But I'm just going crazy. 

**Update:** Thank you all for your kind words and advice. He has decided to stay at home, which hurts me, but I know it's what's best for him. And I know I'll be alright - 21 is still pretty young. We've always kept up solid and honest communication, so he knew exactly where I stood on the issue, and that's the advice I'd give to anyone in a similar situation. Again, thanks!
