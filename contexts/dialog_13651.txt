WILLIE: Primitive sexual practices?
INDIANA: You're talking to an authority in that area.
WILLIE: You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
INDIANA: You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
WILLIE: Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
INDIANA: I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
WILLIE: We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
INDIANA: Don't catch cold.
WILLIE: Dr. Jones?
WILLIE: Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
INDIANA: You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
