MILES: I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
MAYA: What about me?
MILES: I don't know. Why are you into wine?
MAYA: I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
MILES: Yeah? Like what?
MAYA: Like what a fraud he was.
