The Trump campaign has details of the proposed boarder wall payment strategy. Is there any precedent for a policy like this? Will any parts need congressional approval? What types of out comes could be expect if implemented?
https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/pay-for-the-wall The plan details.  The wall has obviously been a big part of the campaign and I just don't know enough about trade or international politics to understand if this is a well developed plan.  I don't want to get into any moral discussions, just what the economic and political effects this could have world wide, if any major at all.
