TOM: I didn't think you'd make it.
JANE: Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here. I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
TOM: There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
JANE: Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
TOM: Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
JANE: Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself. I feel like a little solitude.
JENNIFER: I sure know that feeling. Terrific work today.
JANE: Right back to you.
