My girlfriend committed suicide, and I'm worried I'll end up doing the same
My girlfriend of over 5 years committed suicide a few days ago, and I feel like I'm fucking dying inside. On one hand, I feel so much emotional pain that it's killing me, but on the other hand, I also feel so numb and empty and lost. I can't process it.

I wanted to propose to her. The worst part is that the reason she did it was because she was being sexually abused by a "friend" of mine for years, but kept it a secret from everyone because she was being blackmailed by him. 

I feel like it's my fault. I should have realised. I should have stopped it from happening. I can't believe I let that piece of shit anywhere near her. I feel so much guilt that it's driving me crazy.

My head is a mess. I haven't left the house for days. I haven't spoken to anyone. I've been ignoring all the phone calls and text messages from my family and friends because I can't bear talking about it because I don't want to acknowledge that it's reality. I haven't opened the door to anyone who's tried to come and visit me.

I can't sleep properly, I've practically been starving myself. I just keep thinking that I wanna die. In the shower, I wanna drown. In the kitchen, I wanna take a knife and just end it. I can't take this feeling. I just want her back, I love her so much, and I don't know what I'm going to do without her.

I hate everything right now. And that evil fucking son of a bitch is probably gonna get off free and not even gonna go to prison because I don't have any good evidence. 

Everything's just a mess, and I feel like I'm not fully in control of my own actions at the moment. I don't want my family to find me dead, but I feel like it's what's gonna end up happening if I can't get my shit together. Sorry for the long post
