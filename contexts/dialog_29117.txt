MINISTER JOHNSTONE: Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour. For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK: Excuse me, but - I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6. This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: Admiral, are you suggesting -
BOND: Sorry I'm late -
M: Actually, you're just in time. Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
