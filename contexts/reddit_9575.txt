Stuck in job and wanting to job search
I’ve been wanting to get an entry level job in a university to get some experience for graduate school in student affairs. Now, however, I fear that I’ll have to be stuck in my job that I have now for longer with the covid-19 outbreak. I’m curious as to if anyone thinks that it’d be possible in the somewhat near future to take a leap and go job searching in the field. I’d also like to network in the meantime but am having troubles with that as well. Any suggestions or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
