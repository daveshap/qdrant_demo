MEG: He's not home.
FETTES: Where can I find him?
MEG: You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
FETTES: But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
MEG: There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
FETTES: At Pennycuik. I know the inn. I can be there in an hour.
MEG: And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
