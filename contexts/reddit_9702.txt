Dream school, but need to take out loans
Hi all. 
I’ve been accepted into my dream program. It offers me everything I want in a program plus so much more. 
The only downside to this school is that it costs tuition. I qualify for some scholarships, but will need to take loans out. 
This school offers me so many amazing opportunities that I wouldn’t have elsewhere. What is your advice on this?
