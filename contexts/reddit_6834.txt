Employer gave me a letter at the start of the week saying I'll likely be made redundant at the end of the week.
So my Employer gave me a letter basically stating that due to the business, specifically my branch, running at a loss and that I have been chosen as a likely way to cut back costs. they've given me a week notice and in the letter they specifically state that it's very likely. Now I thought that this was very strange, I would have thought that if a business is writing a letter like this they've already made a prior decision.  Any ideas what the purpose behind a letter like this might be?

Someone pointed out to me that this might be some sort of scare tactic to try and get me to leave without paying me out, is that a possibility?

Lastly, are there any downsides to being made redundant that I am too naive to see right now? Because this in my eyes is actually a good thing as I'd been looking for another job already and now I'll be getting a payout along with finally being able to move on.
