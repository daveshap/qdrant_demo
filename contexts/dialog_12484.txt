TREVOR: Sorry.
ALLISON: If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
TREVOR: I understand... I won't-
ALLISON: No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
TREVOR: Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
ALLISON: Just get better okay?
