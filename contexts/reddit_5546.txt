Is online certifications useful for job application? Currently looking at GCP certification course.
I'm new to the workforce and I'm very motivated to gain a better position step by step. I've tried the LinkedIn premium trial account and discovered some online courses that gives certificates. 

However, I'm wondering if they will actually be useful for job search aside from my own genuine curiosity for knowledge.

I'm hoping to get into a pharmaceutical company and one of the often skills listed is good clinical practice (GCP) certification. 
Will they consider free online GCP courses?
