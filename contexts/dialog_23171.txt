DETECTIVE KINCAID: That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
GALE: Shit. Sarah Darling. I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
GALE: Who?
DETECTIVE KINCAID: I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
GALE: But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
GALE: Please, call me Gale.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
