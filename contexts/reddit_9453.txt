Does anyone else feel terrible about having $0 in their Savings Account?
Okay, so hear me out guys. I’m nineteen years old, working a lil’ job maybe making upwards of $160 a week, plus more if I choose to do some side work as well. I should be going to college, but I’m kinda putting it off for now. I live with my parents, and don’t really pay bills outside of my phone bill, and the occasional flight here and there.

But let me tell you, when I see that $0.00 in my savings, I feel like shit. Everything else good in life just fails. I completely and utterly feel as if I have no hope, like everyone else that is successful in life started saving way before me. I don’t know if the excessive worrying and intrusive side to my depression disorder is making me overreact and feel terrible, or if I’m actually fucked and I should just give up, continue to blow my money on food and drugs, and ultimately feel like everyone in the world has passed me by.

I would absolutely love to hear your input. Thanks, guys. ❤️



EDIT: oh my god, I wish I could reply to every last one of you 💓😭. your advice, criticism, and insight has genuinely made me feel better about the situation I’m in. I’m going to work on my mental illness and start saving my money! And Once I move next month, I’m gonna work to tone it down on the drugs, and get into college. I’ve read every last comment, and will to continue to do so in the future, always reminding myself that it’s not too late for me! 

From the bottom of my heart, i thank each and every last one of you 🖤
