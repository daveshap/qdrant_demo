ALEXANDER: ... Well, you wanted to see it.
KALEN: This is it?
ALEXANDER: Around here.
ALEXANDER: Yes. Just about here.
KALEN: But there's nothing here.
MARA: It was different then.
ALEXANDER: My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is. Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
MRS. WATCHIT: I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
PHILBY: And you've no idea where he went?
MRS. WATCHIT: No, sir.
ALEXANDER: And this would be my study. There was an elm tree outside the window then.
PHILBY: I'm glad.
MRS. WATCHIT: Sir?
PHILBY: I'm glad he's gone. Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
ALEXANDER: This... was my home.
PHILBY: His home.
