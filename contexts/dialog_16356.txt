SAM: Mrs. Bledsoe?
MINNIE: That's me.
SAM: I'm Sheriff Deeds--
MINNIE: Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
SAM: Yeah, that's the story of my life.
MINNIE: You ever play one of these?
SAM: I've seen 'em.
MINNIE: Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
SAM: You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
MINNIE: I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
SAM: He had the club out on the old trail road--
MINNIE: We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
SAM: So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
MINNIE: Not if I can help it.
SAM: You had to deal with him in running the club.
MINNIE: Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
SAM: He squeezed money out of you?
MINNIE: Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, Buy yourself a drink
SAM: And my father?
MINNIE: Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
SAM: People didn't complain?
MINNIE: Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
SAM: Do you remember the last time you saw him?
