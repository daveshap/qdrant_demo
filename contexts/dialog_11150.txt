CLAY: What was that about?
WHALE: Nothing of importance. Just two old men slapping each other with lilies. Shall we have a drink?
CLAY: Who's that?
WHALE: David. The friend I thought was in New York.
CLAY: No. The girl.
WHALE: Girl? Oh. Elizabeth Taylor.
CLAY: Is that really her?
WHALE: David produced her last picture.
DAVID: What are you doing here?
WHALE: Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
DAVID: I was, until last night. Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
