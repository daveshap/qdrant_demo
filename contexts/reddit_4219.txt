Is it just me or is Tinder absolutely awful?
Maybe I’m a little biased because I met my ex on Tinder, but I feel the app has gone down hill since I last used it 4 years ago. I feel like nobody on the app takes it seriously at all and are just doing it for the meme. My ex and I split last year and I’ve been using Tinder since November. I swear I’ve only met two people who I matched with since I started using it. Obviously I’m aware that less people are comfortable meeting with people due to COVID going around, but I’ve met plenty of matches from Hinge. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think any dating site is perfect and there’s plenty of downsides to online dating in general. However, Tinder just seems particularly shitty. Maybe I’ve just been out of the dating game too long and I’m not doing it right? I’m only 25 so I’m definitely still in the target audience for Tinder. Anyone else feel the same way or am I just giving off “old man yells at cloud” vibes right now?
