JONAH: It was sinking.
SAM: What was?
JONAH: Our house. There was water coming in all the windows.
SAM: You're worried we're going to be all right. We're going to be all right. I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby. Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
JONAH: Bye bye blackbird.
SAM: Is that what she used to sing?
JONAH: I miss her. What do you think happens to someone after they die?
SAM: I don't know.
JONAH: Like do you believe in heaven?
SAM: I never did. Or the whole idea of an afterlife. But I don't know any more. I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway. So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
JONAH: I'm starting to forget her.
SAM: I know. But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you. And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
SAM: I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
JONAH: Good.
