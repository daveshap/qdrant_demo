Don't be loyal to your car insurance. Just saved $1000.
I live in a state where car insurance is mandatory. A few years back I was unemployed and completely broke. Like -$200 to my name. My car insurance was canceled and a few months later when I was working again I was trying to get insurance. The fact that I had lapsed for so long made it nearly impossible to get insurance. Finally I was able to get [Company A] for around $190 a month. Recently I got a different car. I paid $500 cash for this car. I switched it over on my car insurance and they upped my policy to $300 a month. I called to find out what happened and tried to negotiate. I ended up bringing it down to around $250 a month or $1490ish every 6 months. I told them it was still unacceptable as I don't want anything more than the absolute basic coverage. In two months I would have paid as much in insurance as I paid for my car. If my car gets hit to the point of being non functional I am junking it. It's nearly 20 years old. 

Anyway I started shopping around and ended up switching to [Company B]. I got basic coverage through them and it ended up only costing me $487 for six months if I paid up front (around $600 if I paid month to month). I don't have a lot in savings but I felt this was a good reason to use some savings funds. The idea that I'm going to saving nearly $200 a month is a good feeling. Even compared to my old policy I'm saving around $100 a month. I feel silly for not switching earlier. 

TL;DR: Insurance company jacked up my policy to nearly $1500 every 6 months, shopped around and was able to get a policy for around $500 every 6 months. 

P.S. be prepared to get a million emails and phone calls if you put your information into any sort of car insurance quote site.
