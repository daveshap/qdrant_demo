WOODY: I always wondered what happened with us.
KAT: I haven’t thought about that in years.
AMY: Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
KAT: Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
KAT: She’s drunk. -er than me. But I didn’t really dump you, did I?
WOODY: Hard.
