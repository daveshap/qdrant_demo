most annoying college ever?? BLOCKED BAYBEEE!!!
FINALLY getting to block all of the colleges that I didn’t apply to 🥴🥴 and I’m SO EXCITED TO BLOCK CASE WESTERN!!

“I want to see your application”

“I’m looking forward to reading your application”

“Where is your application you dirty wh*re”

Case is just always up my back about applying to them it got BEYOND annoying. Now, I am glad to say goodbye to their emails.

Any other opinions about what the most annoying college is??

P.S. I didn’t block them earlier because I’m paranoid and indecisive and considered applying
