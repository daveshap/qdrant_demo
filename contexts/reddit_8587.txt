Is Herman Cain qualified to sit on the Federal Reserve Board?
Yesterday, President Trump [nominated](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/437467-trump-says-he-will-nominate-herman-cain-to-fed-board) [Herman Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Cain) to fill one of the vacant seats on the [Federal Reserve Board,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors) which oversees the central banking system of the United States. 


Cain was formerly a presidential candidate, CEO of Godfather's Pizza, and CEO of the National Restaurant Association.

[Some have argued](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/trump-herman-cain-federal-reserve-gold-standard.html) that he's unqualified for the position and his nomination ["puts the institution at risk."](https://www.ft.com/content/b818fd1e-5730-11e9-91f9-b6515a54c5b1) 

However, during a four-year period in the 1990s, Cain was a member and then chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, so despite not being an economist, he does have high-level experience in this organization. 

Does that make him qualified?
