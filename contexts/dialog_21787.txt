VICKIE: You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
JAKE: Yeah --
TONY: It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
JAKE: What time is it?
TONY: Nine o'clock.
JAKE: At night?
TONY: Yeah. At night.
JAKE: How many pounds I gotta lose?
TONY: Three more, I figure.
JAKE: Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
TONY: I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
JAKE: Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
VICKIE: Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
JAKE: I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
VICKIE: Jake --
JAKE: What?
VICKIE: I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
JAKE: OK. Talk.
VICKIE: Why don't you just call him up?
JAKE: What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, Joey
VICKIE: No, not that.
JAKE: Then what?
VICKIE: I don't know.
