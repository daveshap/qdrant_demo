DAY-DAY: Roach...Roach, come on.
ROACH: Where's Craig?
DAY-DAY: He's inside the house?
ROACH: Why did he go in the house?
DAY-DAY: Don't worry about it. We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now.
KARLA: You did all this for me?
CRAIG: Most of it. I just hate to see you in this situation.
KARLA: Thanks for noticing. It used ta be peaceful before they got out. Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
CRAIG: Why didn't she put'em out?
KARLA: Easier said than done. We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
CRAIG: I'm sorry to hear that.
