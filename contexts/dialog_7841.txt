REVEREND MOTHER: Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
PAUL: Not all of them... I know which ones will.
REVEREND MOTHER: Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
PAUL: What is it?
REVEREND MOTHER: The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
PAUL: Where?
REVEREND MOTHER: Do you know of the Water of Life?... the Truthsayer drug?
PAUL: I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
PAUL: Did they try and fail?
REVEREND MOTHER: They tried and died.... Jessica!
REVEREND MOTHER: I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
PAUL: I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
