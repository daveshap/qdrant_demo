How does one convert a dmg inside a DVD to individual videos or watch the dmg DVD file in an iphone? Since DVDs are essentially becoming obsolete or at least the macbook laptops do not have accessibility to them anymore, I thought it would be good to back a backup for them before I get rid of the DVD reader laptop and thus still be able to watch my videos.The issue is that I don't know how to watch the DVD inside of my iphone even if I have access to the dmg file. One solution could be to have some app that access the DMG through dropbox/icloud and then open it with the app. Does that exist?What I thought was more sensible was since some of these are lessons divided into separate videos, to convert the DMG to individual mp4 or .mov files which are easily watchable in the iphone. Is that possible?
