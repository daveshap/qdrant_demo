Suicide is becoming a more and more attractive option each passing day.
I don’t know what to say except that. I’m so fucking done. I’m not going to do it and I don’t plan to. But, even when I tell myself tomorrow is going to be a better day, it just isn’t and killing myself seems more and more an actual option.
