Mid/late 30s Career change, any interest in this story?
I see a lot of posts on this forum looking for help on how to go about changing career after the reality of an industry hits home, or after spending a long time in an area and feeling trapped, or just a general lack of passion.

I have felt this pain, and I wonder if I can help a bit.

It has been a proud couple of months for me - I both turned 40, and started a fantastic new job that I had been targeting for a very long time, after finding myself unhappy and depressed in a dead end job in a separate industry at 35. I was able to do this without taking a pay cut.

It has been a long, and at times painful journey fraught with difficulty, but is it one that might offer some value to someone out there.

Would anyone be interested in reading such a story?

Edit: Ok I will write it up. Will need to be tomorrow morning though. I would like to do a good job of writing it, and I need some sleep.

**OK here we go:**

Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that my experience will not be applicable to everyone. We all have a different situation, and some of the things I describe will not be possible to replicate. That said, it is my hope someone will get something out of it, even if it is just motivation rather than a strategy or practical advice. 

Secondly, I also need to recognise that luck played a part. I would like to believe that some of the luck was created through hard work, but at certain points people did things for me that they really didn’t have to.
I will try and keep it brief, but my story takes place over a long time with lots of twists and turns, so you might want to grab a coffee! Anyway, here goes.


Five years ago, I had painted myself into a career corner. 12 years working in a technical role for large Telecommunication companies left me with a very specific set of skills in a profession I had no passion for. (I don’t want to divulge too much detail about the role, as I don’t want to offend anyone who does it). I had grown very competent at it, but it wasn’t for me. Added to this, the only way “up” was through general management, which held little appeal for me, and in an area where people traditionally retired after doing the same role for 40 years or more, there was also very little opportunity for development or movement.


Anyway, one day I had an epiphany (won’t go into detail), and decided I absolutely must change something, anything.


Trouble is, and I think there are a lot of people in this boat – *I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do.*


My first step was to look around for other jobs at the company I worked for, as I figured it was probably practical to make an internal transfer in a company that trusted me, than go in “cold” elsewhere. I had a good relationship with my Line Manager, who was very understanding and supportive. He didn’t want me to leave, but he understood that I was unhappy and that in the long term it would be no good for him or for the team to try and make me stay. I suppose you could say that my first stroke of luck was having a good relationship with an intelligent and supportive Manager. 


We devised a plan. Under the guise of “professional development” in learning about the company, he arranged for me to spend a day with other teams, based on job descriptions I saw on the company Intranet. All had partial skills matches with what I did already, and on paper a role within any of the teams would represent meaningful career progression. I did this about three times, and I certainly learned a lot – about what I didn’t want to do. Here was a lesson learned for me, no matter how amazing a job description sounds, the reality can be much different.


I kept going. Then, a stroke of luck: while this was happening, my team were “treated” to a training course. It was the first piece of official training most of the team had had for nearly a decade, so we were looking forward to it. I was on a specific piece of software we were migrating to, and it was very hard to use. It was so specific in fact, that the trainers had to be flown in from Europe at great expense. 


They “phoned it in” as they say in the US. The trainers were poor, and one of them was offensive and rude, particularly to older members of the team who were having trouble picking up the software. I ended up assisting, as I had used the software extensively before and had an affinity for technology. I managed to defuse the situation, (aforementioned trainer was going to get punched).


Afterwards, I fed back to my manager what I thought of the training (awful). He challenged me to do better. I had some good feedback from the team, and was already mentoring new starters, so I thought – why not? I was convinced I could not do any worse. 


Our contract with the training provider was not renewed, and there was a training gap, so I volunteered to deliver a course. I had no idea really what I was doing, I only resolved to do two things: Ensure everyone learned everything they needed to, and treat everyone in the room with dignity.  


It went brilliantly, and I loved it. It caught me by surprise, I am normally a very quiet and reserved person, so public speaking in front of colleagues should have terrified me, but it didn’t. My parents had warned me off education as a career prospect early on, as they were both teachers and said there was no money in it. In the Public Sector, this was (is?) certainly true. I was determined to do make this work however, and decided to do some research. 

*What if there was some way I could combine something I was good at (technology), with some I actually cared about (education), and not take a pay cut in the process?*


*Technical Training* was what I found, and that is what I do now.


Of course, I was only half way there, I had found a potential career, but I wasn’t actually doing it yet. I applied for some Training Roles, but got no responses. It became evident that I needed the experience. It was at this point I had another knockback, and a blow to my confidence. My Manager set me with a meeting with our HoD. My mission was to convince him that our department needed a full-time trainer, and that I was that person. I was naïve however, and didn’t realise that what I needed was a bulletproof business justification – this was after all, a penny counting operational department. For all intents and purposes, I was laughed out of the room. Awful moment for me.


I didn’t give up. My company was big enough that we had our own training department, and I kept my eyes open for job opportunities there. I wanted nothing left to chance - when an opportunity came up I wanted to be 1st in line. To that end, I volunteered for every training delivery opportunity possible. I dressed professionally so trainees felt they were getting a “paid for” experience (they weren’t). I did my very best to ensure the training was fun and engaging, everyone left the training room armed with what they needed to know, and I made sure they felt 10 feet tall. I created an online community using our corporate intranet, recording and uploaded lots of tutorial videos to it which people found useful. At this point some of my colleagues thought I was a suck-up, but I didn’t care, I was too far invested and had a plan.


I played the long game. It took maybe 6-9 months of this, but my reputation grew. Managers from over the country started asking for me specifically to deliver training, and they negotiated with my Line Manager to free me up from my day job so I could.


Eventually, I got the attention of the training department, and I interviewed for the next available position as a Technical Trainer. They were very impressed with the work I had done on my own, and sought feedback from the people I trained – which (I assume) must have been positive. My strategy had worked, I was the person they wanted!


After the interview process, I was offered the role - at 15% less than my current salary. To train people to do the role that I was currently in. I went from elation to disappointment in a heartbeat. Another awful moment. My Wife and I were saving every penny for a house deposit, and there was no way we could take that kind of income hit. 


Despite all the hard work getting me to this point, I had to tell them no, I could not accept a base salary cut. I needed them to counter. It was a gamble, and one of the most difficult conversations I have ever had.  


It was a calculated gamble though. I was miles ahead of the other candidates, and I deliberately left salary negotiation as late as possible in the process in case they low balled me. I figured, the longer they went without completing the hire, the stronger my negotiating position became. Especially if they made the foolish move of informing the unsuccessful candidates before I formally accepted.


Unbeknown to me, this also paid off. The hiring Manager became desperate, and drove for half a day to the HR Directors Office to convince her that he needed me for the job. He was successful, and had a whole new job band created just for me, so they could pay my current salary.


**Success!!!** Everything up until this point took about 2.5 years.


For the next 2.5 years, I set about learning my new field. My story is already pretty long, but I need to mention that this part was also quite difficult. I enjoyed the work for sure, and was good at it – but going from the guy who knows everything, to the guy who knows nothing was tough. Learning from people 10 years my junior, reporting to people 5 years my junior. It was humbling, even a bit depressing at times.


I did a lot of graft however, learned everything I could, as fast as I could. I had fantastic professional development opportunities too. As a result, I outgrew the role. Now armed with a whole lot of relevant experience in my CV, I recently started a new job, in a new company, in a more senior role and I finally feel like the change has been a success. 


If you have made it this far, you can imagine it was a long road. There is actually a lot I have left out, but this post is already too long, so I’ll just say thank you for reading and if you have any questions I am more than happy to answer.


**TLDR:**

-	Use any research method you can think of to find something that you both have an affinity for, and care about.

-	Find a practical way to go about making a change.

-	Don’t give up when you experience setbacks.
