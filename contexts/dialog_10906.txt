JORDAN: Permission to get dressed, sir?
THE CHIEF: It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs. Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives. They don't use women anymore.
JORDAN: Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross. May I ask what you got it for?
THE CHIEF: For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
JORDAN: I see. So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
THE CHIEF: Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant?
THE CHIEF: Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion. Men fight better without women around. And that is an historical fact.
JORDAN: It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir. So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
THE CHIEF: England went out with a stress fracture. That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
JORDAN: McCool's that same rank. We're both j.g.'s.
THE CHIEF: You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer. Remember. There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.
