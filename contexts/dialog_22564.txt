HAN: I would like one of my people to help.
RUSS: Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
HAN: He is very good.
RUSS: As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
HAN: I am not an American, Mr. Russ. My daughter is not an American.
RUSS: I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
HAN: He is already on the plane. I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
