What specific crimes, misdeeds or improprieties are alleged to have been committed under the "Obamagate" moniker and what evidence is there to support or oppose those allegations?
Hello.

There have been various news articles recently about a supposed scandal referred to as "Obamagate," which seems to have something to do with events that took place back in 2016. Here are some examples:

1) Example of a piece mostly putting this into the context of original Obama-Trump conflict, the birther episode: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/obamagate-birtherism-all-over-again/611692/

2) Another piece, which dismisses the proposed scandal immediately (paywall warning): https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-absurd-cynicism-of-obamagate/2020/05/15/03464e0a-96ea-11ea-9f5e-56d8239bf9ad_story.html

3) This piece makes Obamagate sound like a really serious scandal. While it does not conflict with the others on the main facts, it spins the same thing very differently. Essentially, the "unmasking" considered routine in the other sources is apparently not routine at all: https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/fred-fleitz-obamagate-how-obama-administration-apparently-weaponized-intel-agencies-for-political-attacks

I would like to know:

i) What crime (official lawful infraction) is Obama alleged to have committed and what is the evidence supporting or opposing that allegation?

ii) Aside from legality/illegality, what is alleged to be improper about what Obama did?

iii) What statements have been made arguing that Obama's actions were or weren't immoral?

iv) Is this an issue that came out this week, or is it a new narrative based on publicly known information?

v) Aside from embarking on an ambitious research project to find truth every time something happens, is there any way to actually know what is happening during stories like this? Are there go-to sources that can be universally trusted when it comes to deciphering alleged political scandals?

Thank you to all those who take the time and effort to comment thoughtfully.
