Mapping values by Census Tract - California I was able to map values by county in California, but I am trying to map by census tract. I downloaded the census tract file from census bureau and it shows 8,041 values. For the values, I pulled in the census block. How do I get the census block to match up to the cb_2017_06_tract_500k shapefile? The values in this attribute table are StateF, CountyFP, TractCE, AFFGEOID, GEOID, NAME, LSAD, ALAND, and AWATER.
