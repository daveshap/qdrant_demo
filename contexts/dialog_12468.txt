TREVOR: Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
ALLISON: Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
TREVOR: No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
ALLISON: You need to get better first Trevor. Way better. It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
