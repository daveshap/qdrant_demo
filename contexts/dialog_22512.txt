EARL: Shit! We're gonna have to get rid of him. I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life. We can't risk it.
BOOTH: What are you thinking?
EARL: I don't know...
BOOTH: You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one.
EARL: Well neither have I, but it's us or him. If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in. Besides, he's just a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway.
BOOTH: I can't do that.
EARL: Okay then. I'll do it.
BOOTH: That's not what I mean.
EARL: Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do.
BOOTH: He would have done it to us, right?
EARL: Exactly. This is our little secret, partner.
