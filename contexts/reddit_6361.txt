Just got hired to take over a Hookah Lounge, would like to see what your ideas are to help fix it!
So I just got hired and have previous Owner experience to help manage and correct a long standing Hookah lounge in town. When this place was good it was doing 200k a year and ran like a top. Now I am walking into a staff that is disappearing to other jobs, no management structure, everyone is friends with everyone and inter-dating within the business, and giving away product to regulars. The owners are dedicated to correcting everything but they and I have agreed that they can't be the managers and owners and staff and everything in between.

So guys, what ideas do you have for fixing the staff issues, setting up a structure and anything else you can think of!
