What should I expect as a first timer in residence life? (x-post /r/ResLife)
Hey everyone!

It is beginning to look like I will have my first experience working in residence life in the near future, including on call rotations, central office work, advising, and working on programs.

I was wondering if you might have anything that might be great to know/prepare for as I get ready to transition into residence life for the first time (including boundary setting/time management/etc related tips, I'm sure my wife and I could use them!)

Thanks!
