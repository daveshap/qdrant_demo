Finding a job or wait on EI?
For some context. I’m from Canada. I had been working part-time at a gym and was offered full time there. The week that I was supposed to start working full-time, my gym shut down because of COVID-19. It’s been a good month and a half now since I last worked. 

I refused to get onto EI during the first four weeks just because I still live at home and don’t have a lot of bills to cover and cuz I didn’t want to be a burden (as weird as it may sound). I have already apply for EI but I have doubts I may qualify for it as I had only been working part time for the last four months and have yet to start working fulltime before I got laid off. 

Initially my workplace was supposed to open this coming week but I received an email from higher ups saying we will be closed indefinitely until we get the go-ahead from the health authorities and is uncertain when that day will come. 

Right now. I’m deciding on applying out to jobs nearby that are hiring. There’s a cleaning position at a hospital and it pays pretty well. 

Would I be burning bridges with my old workplace if I’m to apply out to jobs? Is this a bad decision I’m making? I have already came across news articles saying that our national lockdown and social distancing practice will continue until a vaccine is created and it won’t be until sometime next year or longer.

To add some more... I would definitely go back to my old workplace once we re-open but because of the uncertainties of our lockdown... I don’t think it’s a good idea for me to wait on IE.
