NICKY: Okay, Sammy.
ACE: Somethin', huh?
NICKY: Yeah.
ACE: Ginger.
NICKY: Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
ACE: Honey, come here.
ACE: This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
JENNIFER: Good to meet you.
GINGER: Hi, Jennifer.
NICKY: Pleasure. Very nice to meet you.
GINGER: Hi, how are you?
NICKY: Okay, Sammy.
ACE: After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it.
NICKY: What do you think about me movin' out here? What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
ACE: No, of course not.
NICKY: You mean, I have your permission?
ACE: Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
NICKY: I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there. Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
ACE: Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
NICKY: Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
NICKY: Ace saw Vegas one way.
NICKY: You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
MARINO: Of course.
NICKY: But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to? So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
ACE: Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky? Nicky was the muscle.
NICKY: Tony.
TONY: Hey.
NICKY: How you doin'?
TONY: How you doin'?
NICKY: All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
TONY: What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
NICKY: I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
TONY: You sure?
NICKY: I'm positive.
TONY: Well, I'm a little confused here.
NICKY: You're a little confused?
TONY: Yeah.
NICKY: Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!
TONY: I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
NICKY: Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
TONY: My fuckin' head.
NICKY: Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
MARINO: Smarten up.
NICKY: You jag-off.
