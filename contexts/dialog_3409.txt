LOTTE: Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
CRAIG: Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
LOTTE: You fell in love with her first.
CRAIG: Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
LOTTE: You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
CRAIG: That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
LOTTE: Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
CRAIG: Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
LOTTE: I need a shower.
CRAIG: I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, he's some kind of monster.""
LOTTE: You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
CRAIG: I love you so much.
CRAIG: But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
MAXINE: J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
LOTTE: We have to meet.
MAXINE: One hour.
