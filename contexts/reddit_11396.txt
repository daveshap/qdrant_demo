My family is imploding.
My mum and dad have had problems for a long time, at least 10 years. My dad drinks too much.

But recently things seemed to be ok. Dad still drinks too much, they argue on and off but nothing major. 

They've been doing the kitchen up recently. Mum decided she wants it open plan. So dad took down the kitchen wall. Argued a bit about it, but it came down.

Then he's realised he'll have to sort the ceiling. There's been a leak for a while. So today my dad had the day off work. He decided just to pull the ceiling down.

Mum came in from work and freaked out, understandably, about the giant hole in the ceiling and the bits of ceiling all over the floor. She yelled a bit, grabbed her car keys and left with my sister.

They came back about half an hour ago, and it's been constant argument ever since. Which is ok, I can deal with that. And then I heard a crash. Thought maybe the rest of the ceiling had just come down too.

And then I heard my mum screaming "what the fuck are you doing? Are you trying to break that too?" Yeah, he threw something at her. Followed by lots of mumbling from dad, and then another loud bump and then my mum yelling "don't you dare punch me" and the sound of a slap. This happened a couple more times, and then my sister's run downstairs crying and screaming to join in the fun.

Edit: my sister shouted at my dad to get out, because no one wants him here. My mum told him to go, but not to take the car or she'll call the police and report him for dangerous driving. My dad doesn't seem to understand what's up with everyone. My sister is now sitting in the bath crying. I'm hungry but don't particularly want to emerge from my room.
