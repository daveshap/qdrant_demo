I’m graduating from college and am worried about employers seeing my social media
I’m graduating in a month and am applying for jobs currently. My Facebook, Instagram, Twitter are all fine in terms of an employer seeing them. My concern is that since I’ve started quarantining I’ve become obsessed with TikTok. I know I’m a child haha. I couldn’t help but come up with ideas and film some of my own. Unfortunately for me I love to drop f bombs and make dick jokes. My TikTok is not my real name and the only thing it is linked to is my phone number. I really care about finding a job but I’m also so bored and love making funny videos. What are my chances of an employer finding these? Thanks in advance!
