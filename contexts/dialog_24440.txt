MORAN: Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin. And forgot the cup.
NELS: Right. In the middle. Of the floor.
MORAN: Maybe.
NELS: I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on. Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
MORAN: Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
NELS: And yet you started the engine right up. With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge. Did that strike you odd?
MORAN: Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
NELS: Does it now?
MORAN: A little. Yes. You have to wonder.
NELS: You have to wonder.
NELS: You found three batteries, you say. A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
MORAN: It is.
NELS: Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery. A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8. It would be too large for the deceased's well.
MORAN: He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting. You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
NELS: But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there. Why not use that?
MORAN: It was dead. We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
