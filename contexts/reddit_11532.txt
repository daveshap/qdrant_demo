I may look okay, but honestly, I'm not strong enough.
I really liked a guy and I know that it would have never worked because I'm not strong enough to be vulnerable without feeling weak. I may come off as this self-assured, loud and confident person, but deep down, I crave love and want someone to like me or just accept me unconditionally without me having to give and give and give until I have nothing left.
  
Then I end up like a dried out insect after a spider is done with it. Just some hollow fucking shell.  
  
Every time I show the vulnerable side. they back out, and I understand. Who would want me? A vulnerable sucker masquerading as a strong girl? I wish I wasn't so afraid.   
  
Maybe one day I'll meet a man who loves me like crazy... But being single is where I'm happiest. I'm too weird for anyone to handle. I'm just a bother. At least I keep myself entertained. Me and my left hand.
