ROWAN: I was born, in New Orleans, too-
MICHAEL: Really...? Your family there...?
ROWAN: Nope- My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth. El1ie was my only blood relation. so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
MICHAEL: Too much... too fast...?
ROWAN: Mm-hmm. Scared- I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
