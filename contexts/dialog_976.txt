PARSONS: It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
HIROKO: What is that?
DILLER: Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system. I found the grating ripped right off. The little fucker was strong.
HIROKO: Where does that lead to?
PARSONS: Central Pumping. All the waste gets treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp. If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
HIROKO: You've checked that end?
