JAKE: It's bad luck.
MILES: Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
JAKE: He'll find us. We go talk to him.
GORDO: Whoa. What?
MILES: We're going to give him the money back?
JAKE: You know what we're doing with the money.
GORDO: And what about Big Al?
JAKE: Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
