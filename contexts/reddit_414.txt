Failing school
my mom is sending me to a private school and sacrifices a lot to do so. i am failing all of classes right now and I have no idea how to tell her. i know i HAVE to break the news to her soon bc  a staff member sent an email home abt two weeks ago asking to have a meeting and somehow she hasnt seen it yet. Once she finds out she’ll probably un-enroll me so if you could offer advice on how to transition to a new school w. a very different atmosphere it would be helpful. This “new” school is much bigger, the kids are (generally) more hostile and im a socially awkward person who has a very difficult time making friends (I’ve been going to my current school which is very small for two years now and I havent made a single friend lol). It is also significantly more academic and I struggle greatly with academics...anyways thanks for reading
