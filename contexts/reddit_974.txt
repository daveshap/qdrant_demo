GOT THROUGH MY FIRST DAY OF WORK WITHOUT A PANIC ATTACK!
Dont get me wrong i was anxious but i was able to get through it and had a good day at work

EDIT: my heart was racing almost all day while I was there because I'm not use to working. Ive been unemployed and unactive for almost a year so it made me anxious about my heart. But i didn't have any chest pains or anything so i guess it was all anxiety related

THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT! YOU ARE AWESOME
