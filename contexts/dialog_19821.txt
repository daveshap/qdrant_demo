CHIGURH: ...You getting anything on this?
MAN: Not a bleep.
CHIGURH: All right...
LORETTA: I thought it was a car afire.
BELL: It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
LORETTA: When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
BELL: Hyah!
BELL: ...I love you more'n more, ever day.
LORETTA: That's very nice.
LORETTA: ...Be careful.
BELL: I always am.
LORETTA: Don't get hurt.
BELL: I never do.
LORETTA: Don't hurt no one.
BELL: Well. If you say so.
BELL: You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
WENDELL: Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
BELL: Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
WENDELL: It could be.
BELL: I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
WENDELL: The old boy shot by the highway?
BELL: Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
WENDELL: That's very linear Sheriff.
BELL: Well. Old age flattens a man.
WENDELL: Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
BELL: Uh-huh.
BELL: ...You ride Winston.
WENDELL: You sure?
BELL: Oh, I'm more than sure. Anything happens to Loretta's horse I can tell you right now you don't wanna be the party that was aboard.
