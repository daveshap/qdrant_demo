Teens would get way more help if being a depressed teenager wasn't a stereotype
Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk


Bye bye

Edit: ok so there has been a bit of an issue here. I believe that I must've read the post somewhere while I was on my medication and it came into my mind and didn't remember that I saw it. So I'm sorry to u/RedditFunnyMan234 Witch is the original poster of this on r/showerthoughts .  I offered to delete the post and they said that they're fine with it as long as they get credit. https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/hpx7uy/what_the_hell_man/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share -link to the post they made about it (couldn't find the original shower thoughts post). Ok sorry for the confusion. Bye bye fr now
