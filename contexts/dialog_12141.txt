PENELOPE: What's the matter now?
SHUTTLE: We got a birthday cake, kid. Did you see the cake?
PAUL: Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
PENELOPE: Who have you been talking to?
PAUL: What difference does that make? Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
PENELOPE: Yes, he is.
PAUL: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
SHUTTLE: That goes double for me.
PAUL: I don't want to live any more.
SHUTTLE: I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything. Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
PAUL: I'll kill myself.
SHUTTLE: The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next? This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I'm concerned. You must be crazy as a fruitcake.
PENELOPE: Possibly.
SHUTTLE: How long has this been going on?
PENELOPE: A week. We were waiting for the right time to--
SHUTTLE: I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
PENELOPE: I'm sorry.
SHUTTLE: Marry me instead.
PENELOPE: Thank you, Herb. You're a wonderful man. You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
SHUTTLE: You're saying no.
PENELOPE: I'm saying no--and thank you.
SHUTTLE: I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it? I was too respectful.
PENELOPE: You were wonderful.
SHUTTLE: What's so wonderful if I lost the sale? You poor kid.
PAUL: Don't touch me.
SHUTTLE: Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
PAUL: No.
SHUTTLE: All my dreams have suddenly collapsed. We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
PENELOPE: It's true.
SHUTTLE: Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
PENELOPE: Is Norbert still here?
PAUL: No.
PENELOPE: Then who flushed the toilet?
PAUL: Father's friend.
PENELOPE: What's his name?
PAUL: Don't know.
PENELOPE: For Heaven's sakes!
PENELOPE: How do you do?
HAROLD: How do you do, Mrs. Ryan? I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are. Am I intruding here?
PENELOPE: Not at all.
HAROLD: I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
