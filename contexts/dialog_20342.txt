CRISWELL: Yes, yes yes I know all that.
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
CRISWELL: I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: It would seem so, Master
CRISWELL: Ahh, but I declare there is still time for <i>some</i>thing.
THE MUMMY: There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
CRISWELL: Ahh, good. Then I will see them. Dismiss the rest.
THE MUMMY: Yes, sir, Master.
BOB: The ropes are coming loose.
SHIRLEY: Be careful!
BOB: I am--It's our only chance.
SHIRLEY: Nothing is worth your life.
BOB: My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
SHIRLEY: I'm frightened. I'm so frightened.
BOB: Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
SHIRLEY: Be careful, oh please be careful. We'll never get out of here alive, I know it. I just feel it.
BOB: You do?
SHIRLEY: Yes I feel it in my bones.
BOB: You're talking nonsense.
SHIRLEY: Oh, no I'm not. These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
BOB: They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
SHIRLEY: I should hope not. I hate you!
BOB: That sudden?
SHIRLEY: Yes, that sudden. If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this. It's all your fault.
BOB: ...And I thought you loved me.
