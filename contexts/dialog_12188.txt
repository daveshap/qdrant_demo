WES: Jake?
JAKE: How did you find me?
WES: I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New York, so I figured you had come out here. What's happening, Jake? What are you doing? Nobody's heard from you. Anne's worried sick. We didn't know if you were dead or alive.
JAKE: Wes, do me a favor.
WES: What?
JAKE: Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
JAKE: Just do what I say. Don't ask.
WES: What is going on?
JAKE: I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
WES: What plan?
JAKE: You don't want to know. Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
WES: What will I tell the others? They care about you.
JAKE: Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
