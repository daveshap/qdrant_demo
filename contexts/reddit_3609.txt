Validating the anger of man under 6'
 

I'm a tall mofo, so I'm not often affected by women's profiles asking for the man to be 6 or taller.

However,  I was just swiping and came across a handful of profiles that asked for  men to be 6 or taller in a distasteful way. If those profiles were  written in this format: "Looking for a man 6 feet or taller" then I  wouldn't have been inspired to make this post. In a single 10 minute  swiping session, I came across these profiles:

1: "Don't be a midget. I'm 181 cm"

2: "I'm a heightist. If you're 5' anything then swipe left."

3: "Short men need not apply"

I  feel bothered by this on behalf of men who don't qualify. I can only imagine how I'd feel if I was the target demographic of these profiles. Sorry,  my bros. Your pain is real.
