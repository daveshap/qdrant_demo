Looking into using a recruiter. Where do I begin the search for a quality recruiter?
So I’m currently employed and love my company. But we are in the midst of a merger/acquisition. As the finality of the merger gets closer I’m starting to feel uncertain that they will keep my team around. With all the “up in the air” feelings around the office, I’ve found that many on my team have already begun their search.
Since I still have a heavy workload I don’t have a lot of time to give toward a job search.
Curious if anyone has tips on finding a quality recruiter that can help me with a Sales/Business Development job search ideally healthcare related. When I look for one, the market is real saturated.
Any direction would be helpful!
