ELLIE: I flinched.
JOSS: Only a tiny bit. Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
ELLIE: That's not doubt. That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct. I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
JOSS: Now you know.
JOSS: ... It's an old story. I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets. By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time. By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that. One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking. Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked. I ended up collapsing in a wheat field. There was a storm... I woke up... And that's about as far as words'll go.
ELLIE: Can you try?
JOSS: I had... an experience. Of belonging. Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
ELLIE: And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
JOSS: Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent. But this experience went beyond both. For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
ELLIE: You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God. To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something. But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real. Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
JOSS: Do you love your parents?
ELLIE: I never knew my mother. My father died when I was nine.
JOSS: Did you love him?
ELLIE: Yes. Very much.
JOSS: Prove it.
ELLIE: What is it? What's happened?
DRUMLIN: We've cracked it. Lunacharsky found it.
ELLIE: You mean --
DRUMLIN: You were right, Ellie. You were right all along.
