LOUISE: Is that how you answer the phone?
JIMMY: I got it. I was afraid I'd missed you. I almost couldn't get a check cashed. It's Saturday.
LOUISE: Who did it?
JIMMY: Friend of mine, owns a club. Dickie Randall. You'd know him if you saw him. His brother was in your class. Terry.
LOUISE: You didn't say what it was for, did you?
JIMMY: No, honey. I told him I was buyin' a car. What is it for?
LOUISE: Good. That was good. Where do I go?
JIMMY: It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel. The address is 1921 North East 23. It's under your name.
LOUISE: And what's the mysterious code word?
JIMMY: Peaches.
LOUISE: What?
JIMMY: That's the code word. I miss you, peaches.
