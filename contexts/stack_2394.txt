How does an Ability Capsule interact with Hidden Abilities? In Pokemon Ultra Moon, I have a Alolan Marowak with the ability Lighting Rod. But what I really want is his ability to be Rock Head. I farmed and tried to give him an ability capsule, but the ability capsule said that it was going to turn him into a Cursed Body Marowak. If I change him into an Cursed Body Marowak and give him a ability capsule again, will it turn him into a Rock Head Marowak, or will it just switch him back into a Lighting Rod Marowak? Rock Head is not a hidden ability.
