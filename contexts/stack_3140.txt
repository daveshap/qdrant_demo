Microwaves in other media I saw a video on how microwaving grapes make plasma. He said that the refractive index of microwave is about 10 inside the grape. Now, we don't know the wavelength of the microwaves in the grape or the velocity. We only know that it has a wavelength of about 12cm and frequency of about 2.45Ghz. Then how do we get the refractive index of microwaves in grapes as 10?
