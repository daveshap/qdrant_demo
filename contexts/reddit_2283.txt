I hate students at Admitted Students Days that brag about the other schools they got into
Like, we *get it*, you got into Brown and Penn with full rides even though you're here touring the same small LAC with the rest of us plebians. Get your head out of your ass and stop trying to assert intellectual dominance or whatever. Why are you even here????

To the rest of you: *please* don't be that kid. You look like an asshole and it just makes the rest of us feel bad.
