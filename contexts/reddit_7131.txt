Web Administrator - Salary Question
I work for a family owned start up in the Firearms industry in the Midwest United States. It is new, but expanding rapidly and we've been averaging $30k daily in gross sales over the past year and have a staff of around 30 employees.

The owner recently approached me to work in my own department managing our flagship website. Something that he has been doing on the daily and is starting to burn him out. The responsibilities would include working closely with him to develop sales/marketing strategies, categorizing our stock digitally, search engine optimization, revising product descriptions, altering pricing of products, and managing on sale items based on what we have in stock working closely with our receiving manager. 

We're supposed to sit down and discuss a raise with applicable bonuses next week. I'm from Hawaii and haven't lived long in the mainland US. The pay where I came from is adjusted for cost of living allowance, thus I don't have an idea of fair and equitable pay for the new work I am being asked to do. I have a degree in Small Business Management and Entrepreneurship and my professional history is helping to run my own family's construction company along with my own business as a marketing broker for prepress publishing firms. 

What would be a reasonable salary to expect for this type of work?
