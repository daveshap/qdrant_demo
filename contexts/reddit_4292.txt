How do I get over this fear and thought?
That I may never get laid. I don't know if anyone finds me attractive. I try dressing up in the best way possible, get that expensive haircut, spray some Cologne, try to smile at people i know. 
I can't flirt or ask a girl out because I fear rejection and being branded a creep by them. I am desperate nowadays and I know sex won't change my life but I want feel love and attraction from someone of the opposite sex..
