WALTER: You know, this is crazy.
VICKI: What?
WALTER: Being here, with me.
VICKI: I know.
WALTER: Most people say the odds are against me.
VICKI: What odds?
WALTER: The percentages --
WALTER: For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
VICKI: Well, most people are stupid. You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
WALTER: Why not tell me now?
VICKI: I got poked around... here and there.
WALTER: Which brother did this?
VICKI: All three -- in chronological order.
WALTER: You must hate your brothers.
VICKI: I love my brothers.
WALTER: No you don't.
VICKI: I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
WALTER: You never asked them about it?
VICKI: Are you serious?
WALTER: Not ever?
VICKI: Not ever.
LUCAS: Hiya, Walter.
WALTER: Cop.
MAN: Sergeant Lucas. May I come in?
WALTER: You are in.
