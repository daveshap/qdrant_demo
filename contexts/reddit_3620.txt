Am i the only guy with this view??
Sex is not even good, I want a loving relationship. I want to feel loved and to share my love. Like at first I thought hey i want sex but when I lost my virginity recently I realised sex isn't all that. Most guys and girls I know talk about sex this sex that but like its not even good to me. I want a relationship that i can build a future around and settle down I dont care to have sex.
