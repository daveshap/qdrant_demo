How long to wait between usage and charging of a LiPo (or Li-Ion) IntroductionLike the most of us I've used Li-Ion batteries in many everyday devices. I also use a few LiPo Batteries in RC-airplanes. In the last years I read about their correct usage and charging. These are some of the things I learned:Discharging a cell below minimum voltage kills it (capacity decreases).Overcharging a cell above the maximum voltage kills it.Thats why you use a balancer while loading a pack of cells in series. It balances the cells to an identical voltage level by discharging the higher-voltage-cells.There's nearly no memory effect. No need to discharge before charging.For long term storage charge it to 65-80%. Not less to avoid undercutting the minimum voltage. More voltage would mean more wear and ageing, because of a higher amount of chemical reactions.You should wait some time after using a battery before charging it again. Which leads me to theQuestionHow long should you wait after usage before charging? For example if I use a battery powered string-trimmer or lawn-mower and the battery has gone empty (and probably quite warm) - how long should I wait before connecting it to the charger?I guess reasons you should wait are temperature, or ongoing chemical reactions. Also I think you should wait longer if the battery had to deliver very high-current like the lawn-mower or a fast rc-airplane which will lead to higher battery temperature.(Sidequestion: if it's about temperature would it help to put the battery in the fridge after use, to be able to charge it earlier?)
