MRS. QUINTANA: I plan to. You want a tip?
PETER: Lemme guess. The lottery.
MRS. QUINTANA: Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
PETER: You know what they say. You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
MRS. QUINTANA: You watch. One day, I'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes. I'll have more money than God.
