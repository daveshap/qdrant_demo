Am I being paranoid? Is my boss trying to get rid of me?
I currently work in a private school.  I'm in charge of the Upper School labs.  I teach also teach a basic CS/programming class, a "computer skills" class (basically power point, office, online research, etc.) and a mid-level math class (Trig/Pre-Calc).

Recently my boss (the Vice Principal, who's also head of HR) has been acting very strangely by giving me a lot of busy work.  For example, she's asked me to correct the test papers of other teachers (edit for spelling/grammar), asking me to cover 1-2 extra classes per day at no extra pay (covering classes is supposed to be overtime), saying that parents aren't happy with the course content (which of course, I have no freedom to decide), and claiming that I'm not being engaged in the community because I am not registered for extracurriculars/coaching.  On the last point, I did try to sign up for some things, but I was rejected (I was the only person who signed up and got rejected).

They said I will have a probation meeting on Monday Morning (with HR and some of my peers) to decide if I will go on probation.  They claim that if I am put on probation, the probation will last only 30 calendar days (typically it is 60 or 90 days), at which point there will be another hearing to decide if I have passed or not.  I think that this is just a way of getting rid of me, but maybe I'm just being paranoid.
