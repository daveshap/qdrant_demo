SAUNDERS: Yes--right here. Just a second-- Miss Paine.
JEFFERSON: *Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke; H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine. Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
SAUNDERS: Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
JEFFERSON: Wow!
JEFFERSON: I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to-- Uh--how's your father?
SUSAN: Splendid.
JEFFERSON: Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
SUSAN: I'm splendid, too.
JEFFERSON: That's--that's splendid.
SUSAN: And how's your bill, Senator?
JEFFERSON: Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean-- I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit. I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
SUSAN: Well! You don't say!
JEFFERSON: It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
SUSAN: Well--I--
JEFFERSON: Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: Clayton
SUSAN: You're not going to take your *suit* off!
JEFFERSON: No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
DIZ: Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today-- How come so early? Get the day off?
SAUNDERS: They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
DIZ: Well, well-- Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, Mr. President
SAUNDERS: I don't mind *who* gets licked in a *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
DIZ: What dame?
SAUNDERS: Paine.
DIZ: Oh--yeah--
SAUNDERS: He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! I'll turn my glamour on him
DIZ: Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
SAUNDERS: Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
DIZ: Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
SAUNDERS: I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
DIZ: Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak. Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side. To genteel crime, kid.
SAUNDERS: And to Don Quixote!
