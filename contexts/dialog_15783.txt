BEN: No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
SERA: To death?
BEN: Yes, that's right.
BEN: I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
SERA: How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
BEN: I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
SERA: Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
BEN: Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
