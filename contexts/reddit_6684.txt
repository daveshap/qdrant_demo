Recruiters reached out and I THINK they assume I'm a programmer. I still want a job there, but just not as an engineer. How can I be honest without getting ghosted after?
I'm jumble-brained right now so I'll bullet point my thoughts:

* My LinkedIn says things about me developing an app and also lists some coding certifications.
* I "understand" some programming languages BUT I'M NOT A PROFICIENT CODER.
* Two ENGINEERING recruiters from big companies reached out and used terms such as "your iOS experience.
* I'm PRETTY SURE they think I'm an engineer \[don't know though because I didn't reply back yet\].
* Don't get me wrong, I'm a "technical" guy and I'd love to build the app I'm working on...but I know my place...I'm just the business / idea guy
* I want to be honest with them if they ask me about coding, but I don't want to scare them away because I'd still love the opportunity to work at those companies as another position.

My question:

* What should I say if I want a job, but they're looking for an engineer?
