DEBI: Which would you rather...?
MARTIN: Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
DEBI: Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
MARTIN: --She's not dead---
DEBI: It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
MARTIN: Wow. I have to give this some thought.
DEBI: No time.
MARTIN: Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
