JOHN: No, I've got it.
GRACE: What happened to your hand?
JOHN: Accident.
GRACE: You should be more careful.
GRACE: It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
JOHN: No trouble at all, really.
JOHN: Wasn't nothing.
GRACE: Oh, this isn't my car. It's down a ways. I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy. I could drive up.
JOHN: That's all right. I got it.
