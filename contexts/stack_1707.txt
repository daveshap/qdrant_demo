Linear Regulator PCB placement I'm designing a PCB with some noise-sensitive components (FPGA, RF mixer, etc.). For the power systems I've decided to chain switching regulators to LDO regulators so that I get less heat dissipation and better noise performance than either alone. However, I'm unsure as to the optimal location of the LDO regulators. My thought is that they should be placed near the outputs of their corresponding switching regulators so that switching noise is confined to the edge of the board. Or is it better to place them near the loads they drive? The second setup could result in a slightly more accurate voltage across the load since less of the LDO output voltage will drop across the power traces, but since my board isn't too big and I have room to make the power traces wider if need be, I'm not too worried about that. I'm also not too worried about trace inductance because the bypass capacitors should take care of that.What else am I not considering here? Is there a typical way this is done?
