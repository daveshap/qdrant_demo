LIEUTENANT: It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
HAWKEYE: Your enemy...
LIEUTENANT: What did you say?
HAWKEYE: I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
LIEUTENANT: Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
HAWKEYE: First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio. Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
LIEUTENANT: Will you men help us stop the French?
HAWKEYE: ... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
