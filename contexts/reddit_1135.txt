Anyone else get anxiety over just making a Reddit post?
It seems when I want to post something, I'm excited about it because it's a subject of interest and I want to discuss it. But then when I post it and get replies..there's always at least one person who is really rude and implies that whatever Im talking about is dumb. 

Then I get anxiety. I get defensive at times too. Sometimes I get close to deleting the post because I don't like people disrespecting me when I know damn well I don't deserve it
