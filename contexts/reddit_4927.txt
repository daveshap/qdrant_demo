I feel unwanted and unloved
I’m 19yr girl. I’ve always had a rocky life. I’ve had an eating disorder since I was in 6th grade and,I’ve always thought that I was never enough.Then in 2017 I went through this long period of having severe health anxiety to the point where I would think my hand would stop working if I thought about it too much(Ik it’s weird)...lately it’s been my bf who’s made me feel like I wanna die. He has basically been cheating on me this whole relationship.we’ve been together for a year and 6 months. Today he told me he almost had sex with some random woman he met on the street. 
(Basically she asked him if he wanted to have sex and agreed then he changed his mind )Before this he has only cheated on me with people online,but this really destroyed me.i basically have no self worth anymore.ive been emotionally wrecked by this.i feel like I have no reason to live.Hes my only support,if I leave him I will be alone.i just need some help rn .I’ve felt depressed for many years now but I feel like nothing ever seems to get better.
