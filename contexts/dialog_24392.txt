PADICHE: No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
SERNA: Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
PADICHE: Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
SERNA: Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
PADICHE: ... Jesus... what for?
SERNA: -- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
PADICHE: Wow.
SERNA: Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
PADICHE: Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
SERNA: Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
PADICHE: That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
SERNA: Yeah, I can front this.
PADICHE: Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
SERNA: That's the punchline, y'ready?
PADICHE: Shoot.
SERNA: A million flat.
PADICHE: No shit.
SERNA: None whatsoever.
