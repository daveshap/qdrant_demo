PETER: Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
REGGIE: I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
PETER: Sorry. Which view would you like?
REGGIE: The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
PETER: Peter Joshua.
REGGIE: I'm Regina Lampert.
PETER: Is there a Mr. Lampert?
REGGIE: Yes.
PETER: Good for you.
REGGIE: No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
PETER: Please, not on my account.
REGGIE: No, you see, I don't really love him.
PETER: Well, you're honest, anyway.
REGGIE: Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
PETER: I'm not sure I --
REGGIE: Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
PETER: Oh. I guess.
REGGIE: Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
PETER: Yes, but we're divorced.
REGGIE: That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
PETER: Is your husband with you?
REGGIE: Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
PETER: Mr. Joshua. Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
REGGIE: Now you're angry.
PETER: No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
REGGIE: Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?"
PETER: Shakespeare never said that.
REGGIE: How do you know?
PETER: It's terrible -- you just made it up.
REGGIE: Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
PETER: Are you in the book?
REGGIE: Charles is.
PETER: Is there only one Charles Lampert?
