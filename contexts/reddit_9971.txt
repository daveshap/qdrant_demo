Supervising students vs. Grads vs. Entry level Pros in Student Affairs
What are your thoughts? For me- 

Students are normally volunteer and trying to get Leadership experience to build their resume for the future. Task oriented. Do.

Grads - Want to go into field. More of a learning experience. They want to know more of the whys and should be educated on the processes and how what they are learning in the classroom applies to the work they are doing in their assistantship.

Entry level pros - Mostly in it for the long haul. Looking for experience to get them to the next step. Make sure they have their job/responsibilities down before allowing them to get that extra experience.  Learning their vision for their role and professional development to help them find methods to take them one step closer to their goals
