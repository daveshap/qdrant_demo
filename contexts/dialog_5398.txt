CHUCK: Permission to come aboard, sir.
CHUCK/CAPTAIN: Permission granted.
CHUCK: May I ask, where are you bound?
CHUCK/CAPTAIN: San Francisco. And you?
CHUCK: As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
CHUCK/CAPTAIN: Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess. Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
CHUCK: No please, join me. Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
BADCHUCK: They're never going to see you. You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
GOODCHUCK: They're on autopilot.
BADCHUCK: They're always on autopilot. Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave. They'll never see you.
GOODCHUCK: Damn it! Don't be so negative!
