Can I use a Step-up Power Converter with Arduino instead of a Relay? I want to make two projects that use a 12v input, a solenoid valve and a electrical lock. Both need a 12v current to work. I've seen some exemples for both projects that use a relay and an Arduino to activate mechanisms that need more than the 5v Arduino\u00b4s output. I was wondering, however, if I could use a Step-up Power Converter connected directly to Arduino\u00b4s Digital Pin. Is it possible? And is it safe?
