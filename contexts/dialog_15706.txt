CRAWFORD: Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here. Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
CLARICE: There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...? What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
CRAWFORD: Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming...
CRAWFORD: Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
CLARICE: He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
CRAWFORD: Why?
CLARICE: What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
CRAWFORD: Why not?
CLARICE: He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
CRAWFORD: Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
CLARICE: Like I have a knack" for Dr. Lecter?"
CRAWFORD: Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
CLARICE: You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
CRAWFORD: What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
CLARICE: You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
CRAWFORD: Are you finished?
CLARICE: He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
