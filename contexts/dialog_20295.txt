TERRY: I think we're O.K.
EDIE: Thanks. Steel pipes and baseball bats.
TERRY: They play pretty rough.
EDIE: Which side are you with?
TERRY: I'm with Terry.
EDIE: I'll get home all right now.
TERRY: I better see you get there.
MUTT: A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
TERRY: Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
MUTT: One little dime you don't need. I know you— you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint— –only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
