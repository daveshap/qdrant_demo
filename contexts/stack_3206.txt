Man leads a group out of a dark forest using his heart as a light Does anyone know the name of this story about a man who courageously led a group of people out of a forest? The details are murky for me but this group was frightened to try to leave and he lead them out.Throughout the story, they entered a really dark place and he ripped out his own heart which shined brightly and used it as a light to lead the way. At the very end, when everyone had made it out, he collapsed, and someone stepped on his heart to extinguish the light. It's not a novel, it's a short story if memory serves correctly.
