JANINA: No one thought they'd hold out so long.
SZPILMAN: should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
JANINA: Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
SZPILMAN: Yes, so did the Germans.
JANINA: They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
SZPILMAN: Yes, but what good did it do?
JANINA: What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else? Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
GEBCZYNSKI: Get your things together, you have to leave!
SZPILMAN: What's happened?
GEBCZYNSKI: I'm on the run!
SZPILMAN: What's happened?
GEBCZYNSKI: The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
SZPILMAN: Where do you want me to go? Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
GEBCZYNSKI: That's your decision. But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
