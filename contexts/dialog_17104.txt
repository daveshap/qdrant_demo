REBA: Is that you. D?
DOLLARHYDE: Yes, are you okay...?!
REBA: I'm fine.
REBA: Good morning... If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
DOLLARHYDE: No! Don't go back into the house... It's too nice outside.
REBA: My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
DOLLARHYDE: I have work to do at the plant.
REBA: I'll get my purse.
DOLLARHYDE: I'll get it. Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
DOLLARHYDE: Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
REBA: I'm fine, Francis.
