I requested more financial aid from one of my universities, here's how it went.
One of the most prestigious schools I was accepted into was also one of the most expensive for me, a full $7k more a year than a peer institution. I called the financial aid office to see if they could bump up my grant package last Monday, and explained the whole situation, and told them that without more grant money I would probably be unable to attend, and how one of their peer institutions was offering me a far more viable package. 

Well, they said they'd get back to me shortly, and about 20 minutes ago they called back. They increased my aid by fully *eleven thousand dollars,* just about halving the cost. They did more than match. I really feel like I can't refuse now. 

Don't hesitate to ask for increased financial aid. The worst they can do is say no, and it really helped me!
