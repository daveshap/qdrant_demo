UT Austin has the most inhumane decisions process of all time.
So first they make you wait through wave after wave of decisions that come out every couple days instead of doing it constantly rolling or all at once - so every time it's announced your heart starts racing and you login to the portal only to see nothing.

And *then* they pull this shit they pulled tonight. They released a wave of decisions tonight, and *every single one of them* was an Out of State Rejection.

Screw the UT admissions office.
