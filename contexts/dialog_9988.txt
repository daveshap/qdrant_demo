SAL: Everything's smooth. Beautiful. I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
CHARNIER: You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington? I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
SAL: Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
CHARNIER: Are you having trouble raising the half million?
SAL: Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
CHARNIER: It has to be by the end of this week.
SAL: Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
CHARNIER: It's your problem.
SAL: It's yours too!
