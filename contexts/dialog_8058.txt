JIM: Good for you. Good for you
JIM: So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
TRACY: Sporty.
TRACY: Where to?
JIM: Anywhere you want. Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
JIM: Handles pretty good, don't you think?
TRACY: Yeah.
JIM: Plenty of pep, too.
TRACY: Uh-huh.
JIM: And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
TRACY: That sounds good.
JIM: So Tracy?
TRACY: Yes?
JIM: Why are you doing this?
TRACY: Doing what?
JIM: Coming to see me. Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
TRACY: Nooo. I just thought... l mean, I am looking for a new car. But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends. And then things would be different. Don't you think?
JIM: Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
TRACY: I've got an idea.
JIM: What's this?
TRACY: My house.
