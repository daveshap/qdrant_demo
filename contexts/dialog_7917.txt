BELA: Why are you here??
ED: Shit! Bela, what's with the gun?
BELA: Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
ED: Norma. She changed her mind. She doesn't wanna marry me. Can you put down the gun?
ED: What are you doing?
BELA: I was thinking about killing myself.
ED: Jesus Christ, what an evening. What happened?
BELA: Eddie, I received a letter from the government. They're cutting off my unemployment. That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
ED: Don't you have any savings?
BELA: I'm obsolete. I have nothing to live for. Tonight, I should die. And you should come with me.
ED: Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
BELA: It'll be wonderful. We'll be at peace. In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
ED: Bela, I'm on your side. C'mon, give me the gun... If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink. What are you drinking?
BELA: Formaldehyde.
