GNOME extension \"Internet Radio\" not working while session locked I am using the GNOME extension \"Internet Radio\" under Ubuntu 17.10. It works perfectly fine, except that it is automatically switched off every time the session is locked. I would like it to continue working even while the session is locked. I tried googling several of these keywords, but it returned nothing, so I do not even know where to start.
