DR. REDFIELD: Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
EVAN: I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
DR. REDFIELD: The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
EVAN: It's coming... argh! I can't!
