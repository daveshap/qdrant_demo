MIRTHA: What are we going to do?! What are we going to use for money?!
GEORGE: Please, Mirtha. I'll start working for Augusto. I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
MIRTHA: Don't touch me. Tell me. Just answer the question. What do I spend? What? How will we live?
GEORGE: Not in front of the kid.
MIRTHA: Don't give me that shit. You just better do something.
GEORGE: Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
KRISTINA: What's happening to us?
GEORGE: I don't know.
KRISTINA: Are we gonna split up?
GEORGE: No, never. Don't even think about that, it's impossible. I love your mother. And you are my heart. Could I live without my heart? Could I?
GEORGE: There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
MIRTHA: Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
GEORGE: Hey, why don't you just put a I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car. What is your fucking problem?"
MIRTHA: My problem? We're broke, that's my fucking problem. And you're a fucking spy.
GEORGE: What?
MIRTHA: That's right. Always spying, always judging. Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy. You let Diego fuck you in the ass. Maybe you are a fucking faggot. You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
