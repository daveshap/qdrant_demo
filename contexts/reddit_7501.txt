I'm kind of lost so If you can explain it better
So currently im on my last year of my Master's in Medical laboratory diagnostics and everywhere online that i've read, you can do a PhD after this Master's and thats what I would wanna do. But what i donâ€™t understand is the terms "undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate". So in my country (Croatia) I would have to do now a postgraduate after the Master's (and the Master's is a graduate i guess). One lady at the ERASMUS support service office said i can't do a PhD instantly after the Master's, but first the postgraduate. BUT, on the other hand, online I see under the description of "postgraduate" falls a Master's and PhD. So yea, im kind of all over the place haha, so If anyone could make it a bit more clear I would greatly appreciate it.
Thank you! :)
