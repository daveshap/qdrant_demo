A snake friend
So I hangout with a group of friends, well there's a friend of mine who hates them and bitches about them and there's a female friend of mine in this group who is kind of my best friend. So who bitches about the group also bitched about her, so I told them (cause I trust them more than him) what he did, they said they wanna talk to him and resolve it and confess infront of him that I hate him....but I don't want them to cause he (who bitch about them) lives almost with me, I hate him but I don't want him to know that I hate him also don't want anything shit happen, Just want everything neutral should I Let them talk to him or Do something by myself when he talks shit about them
Not only he bitched about them he also tease me infront of another incel friend cause I hangout with them and also hangout with her too much, "oOoO anon where are your bestfriends", he also said that they (people I hangout) bitch about me, but I asked them if they bitched about me to him, cause they also hate him too for a dick move in the past
I and others (people whom I shared this issue) think that he wants to wipe me out of them
What should I do now
