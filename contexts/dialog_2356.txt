CYNTHIA: Out with Belinda?
LANDON: That's over. Way over.
CYNTHIA: I can't know things if you don't tell me.
CYNTHIA: You saw him?
LANDON: We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
CYNTHIA: After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
LANDON: He wants to show now.
CYNTHIA: You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
