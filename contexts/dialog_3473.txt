JOSEPHINE: I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
EDWARD: Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
JOSEPHINE: Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
EDWARD: Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
EDWARD: There was one time when I was eleven...
JOSEPHINE: You were talking about your wedding.
EDWARD: I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
JOSEPHINE: I like your stories.
EDWARD: And I like you.
