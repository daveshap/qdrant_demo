At what point in your careers you experienced an actual substantial growth?
I hope that my wording is correct. 

At what age or after how many years in your field you started making really good money and/or received a really good title?

\- What is your field?

\- How did you start off? (Your first title, salary)

\- How long it took you to actually get some substantial results?
