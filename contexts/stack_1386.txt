Shock from Capacitive Coupling In an AC supply which is not earth grounded, I see a small amount of current flowing to ground from both wires of the supply (live wire has higher) even though the circuit is incomplete. It is due to capacitive coupling? Can anyone explain it? And why do I get more current from the live wire to ground than the neutral to ground even though neither are grounded? Here is a photo for context.
