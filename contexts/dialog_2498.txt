SHADOW: That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
BRIAN: What?
SHADOW: I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts.
BRIAN: But he killed these guys.
SHADOW: But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
BRIAN: What reason?
SHADOW: Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
BRIAN: That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
SHADOW: No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
BRIAN: Are you going public with this?
SHADOW: No. Do that and I guarantee you'll scare him off. I don't want him running away.
JENNIFER: Hi.
BRIAN: Hey... So are you dating your boss or what?
JENNIFER: If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed. Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
BRIAN: Sorry. Are you dating anyone?
JENNIFER: You think that's really any of your business?
BRIAN: Well, you did invite me here.
JENNIFER: Marty did. But I wanted you to come to.
SWAYZAK: Mr. McCaffrey...
BRIAN: Nice boat.
SWAYZAK: It isn't mine. Let's get a picture.
