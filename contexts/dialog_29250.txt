HARRY: I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
MARSH: Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
HARRY: Those boys never did have good luck.
MARSH: You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
HARRY: Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
HARRY: What's the problem here?
SUZIE: She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
