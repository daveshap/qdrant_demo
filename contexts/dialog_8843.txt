KARRAS: Have we met?
KINDERMAN: No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
KINDERMAN: William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
KARRAS: What's this about?
KINDERMAN: Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
KARRAS: Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
KINDERMAN: Always.
KINDERMAN: You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
KARRAS: I've seen him.
KINDERMAN: You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
KARRAS: Only what I read in the papers.
KINDERMAN: Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
KARRAS: I once did a paper on it
KINDERMAN: Really?
KARRAS: From the psychiatric end.
KINDERMAN: I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
KARRAS: Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
KINDERMAN: And Dennings, you read how he died?
KARRAS: Yeah, a fall.
KINDERMAN: Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
KARRAS: Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
KINDERMAN: It's possible. Possible however…
KARRAS: Unlikely.
KINDERMAN: Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
KARRAS: You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
KINDERMAN: Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
KARRAS: Sick priest, is that it?
KINDERMAN: Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
KARRAS: I don't know anyone who fits the description.
KINDERMAN: Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
KARRAS: No I probably wouldn't.
KINDERMAN: Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
KARRAS: Is that a threat?
KINDERMAN: No, I mentioned it only in passing.
KARRAS: Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
KINDERMAN: Hey, Father? You like movies?
KARRAS: Very much.
KINDERMAN: I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
KARRAS: That's to bad.
KINDERMAN: Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
KARRAS: Who's in it?
KINDERMAN: Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
KARRAS: I've seen it.
KINDERMAN: One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
KARRAS: Come on!
KINDERMAN: Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
KARRAS: Alright. You know who I think really did it?
KINDERMAN: Who?
KARRAS: The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
KINDERMAN: I could have you deported, you know that?
