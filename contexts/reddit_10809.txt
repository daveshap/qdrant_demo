Not today
I talked to her. She doesn't want me anymore. She said she wants ETERNAL PEACE. Was planning to give her that kind of peace. I talked to her mom, who I considered a mother.  She tried to talk me out of it. I still drove to the mountains and was planning to drive the car to a cliff. Someone called me, a friend. She asked how my day went and I cried and told him everything.... I just came home from the mountains... not today..
