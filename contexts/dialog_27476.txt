DANNY: Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
LINA: Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
DANNY: We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
LINA: So what Jew would you kill first?
DANNY: Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
CURTIS: An investment banking house.
MRS. MOEBIUS: He's Jewish? Manzetti?
DANNY: Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
CURTIS: How would you kill him?
DANNY: I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer.
CARLA: Why no silencer?
DANNY: You want it to be an event.
