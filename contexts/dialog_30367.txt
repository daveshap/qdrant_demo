LIZ: Do you love me?
FISHER: Of course.
LIZ: How much?
FISHER: With all my heart.
LIZ: Kiss me...?
MICHEAL: That's just insecurity.
FISHER: I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
MICHEAL: Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
FISHER: What does that mean?
MICHEAL: It means she's insecure.
FISHER: About what?
MICHEAL: Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9. I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
FISHER: I just want her to be happy.
MICHEAL: Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button... Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes... Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343. Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
FISHER: I'm not breathing right.
MICHEAL: You're not breathing right?
FISHER: Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
ADAM: We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
MICHEAL: First of all...
ADAM: No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
MICHEAL: You're interrupting a personal conversation.
ADAM: Sorry Fish.
FISHER: We'll be ready Adam.
ADAM: I know you'll be. Three hours.
MICHEAL: I don't care for him.
FISHER: He's your brother.
MICHEAL: So?
