Does anyone else think about suicide/death a lot but won’t actually do anything?
I just feel like death is constantly in my mind. I wonder when it will be. I wonder if it’ll hurt and what happens after. I often fantasize about dying in a horrible accident that way it wouldn’t be as bad as suicide to my family. Just to think whenever I’m driving it’s just a pull towards a tree and I wonder what’s stopping me. 

I’m not trying to promote this thinking at all! Just wondering if anyone else gets these thoughts? It’s just like death wont leave me alone.
