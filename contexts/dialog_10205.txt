KATE: What's going on?
RICHARD: We're having a wet bikini contest, and you just won.
JACOB: It's okay, honey. Everything's going to be all right.
SETH: Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid. You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
SETH: Where are the keys to the motor home?
JACOB: On the dresser.
SETH: Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard up, and drive it up front.
KATE: Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
RICHARD: Sure.
