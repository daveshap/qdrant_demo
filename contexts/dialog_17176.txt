THOMAS: Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
MRS. PILLETTI: Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
THOMAS: Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.""
MRS. PILLETTI: The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
THOMAS: Right.
