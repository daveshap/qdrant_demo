The appeal of female virginity?
So I am a 22 year old female. I have decided to not have sex until I am married, as I wish go devote myself to one person only. And I wish to build a life with that person. I am not religious. I just belive that love and sex is intertwined and should be between 2 people who will take on the world together. (also take into account my definition of virginity means no sexual acts of any kind) 

So there is a man I am interested in, and we have been chatting for over a year now and finally the topic of sex came up and I explained my views that I am waiting for marriage to have sex and I explained my views on the subject.

His response was first shocked, he first asked how can a attractive woman not have sex into her 20s? And then went on talking about how my views are a bit childish, but good at heart.

Since telling him this information although we chat everyday he is more interested in me. Although he has brought up marriage in the past with me before this conversation twice (I rejected him both times before), he seems to be pushing for marriage again. And wants to meet my parents and tells me about how he can be a good provider.

My question is why is it now that he knows I'm a virgin is he pursuing me even more than before, it's almost like he's scared to loose me now that he knows.

I would love a males perspectiveðŸ˜Šthank you
