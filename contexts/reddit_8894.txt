What models exist for state law patches if Obamacare is repealed federally?
The incoming Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have been planning what's called ["repeal and delay"](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/us/politics/obamacare-repeal.html) which would enact a repeal of many provisions of Obamacare, but delay implementation for [up to 4 years.](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/republicans-obamacare-how-long-will-it-stay-232693)

[Some have predicted](http://www.vox.com/2016/11/17/13665184/obamacare-repeal-delay) that this would cause much more immediate problems in individual marketplaces as insurers pulled out once they saw there was no long term future. 

Obamacare [was modeled on](https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8311.pdf) a state law program implemented in Massachusetts by Governor Mitt Romney, so there's some precedent for state-level reforms there.  Other state-level programs under Obamacare have had less success, [such as the failure of Vermont to implement single payer.](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1501050#t=article)

[This piece](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/patching-obamacare-at-the-state-level/) discusses one option of a state introducing its own individual mandate even if the Federal mandate is repealed.

What other programs have states implemented that might be successful, and what models or papers are there out there on some other possible state-level reforms?
