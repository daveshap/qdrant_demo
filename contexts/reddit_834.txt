[UPDATE] after almost canceling a job interview due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!
I GOT AN OFFER!!!!!!

I went back to pessimism and expecting the worst after a few days of not hearing back, but I did today, and they offered me the job!!!!! Higher pay, almost double the PTO, amazing benefits... I’M JUST SO EXCITED!!!! 

I know on my first day I’m gonna have massive anxiety and second guess everything and wish I stayed in my comfort zone but I don’t even care because this just proves to me that if I push through those nasty feelings I really can do anything!!

Thank you so so so much to everyone that gave such kind words of support and encouragement. This has been a HUGE life changing step for me and it’s amazing to be able to share it with all of y’all.

Edit: I promise I’m done bragging on myself after this but I just negotiated a (slightly, not by much but still!) higher salary as well! I’m over the moon, I can’t believe I’m me and I did this haha. 

Thank y’all, the support in this sub is unbelievable and I’m so glad these posts were able to motivate people. :) every single one of y’all has it in you!
