IRANOFF: Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
NINOTCHKA: You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
IRANOFF: Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
BULJANOFF: It is high time you got out of Russia.
NINOTCHKA: I must be stern with you.
