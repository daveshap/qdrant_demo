FOX: Recognize this?
MAJOR BELL: It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
FOX: Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
MAJOR BELL: They must have picked it up in space.
SHERMIN: Then it's not an accident that they found us.
FOX: We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
SHERMIN: Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
FOX: We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
SHERMIN: That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
FOX: We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
SHERMIN: Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
FOX: You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
