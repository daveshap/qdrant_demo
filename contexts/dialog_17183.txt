MARTY: You say something?
DR. KEEGAN: Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
MARTY: I'm stag.
DR. KEEGAN: Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
MARTY: What?
DR. KEEGAN: I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
MARTY: Are you kidding?
DR. KEEGAN: No, I'm not kidding.
MARTY: You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
