I don't know what to do
so i created this throwaway to ask this quesiton.  I dont really have anyone to talk to abt this so im kinda desperate.  Im entering highschool and ive been dating this girl for around two and a half months.  Ive known her since i was in kindergarten.  Becuase we go to private schools we can choose what school we go to.  I am going to a school that is around 45 minutes away from my house.  My older brother also goes there so he will be able to drive me there every day.  My girlfriend is going to a school that is around 10-20 minutes away from my school.  Because she has a rich grandmother she will have an apartment out there.  She will be at the apartment Monday-Friday and will be back at here house that is 15 minutes away from mine on the weekends.  There are really two questions im going to be asking. We are really clingy and can barely be away from each other for a few days without missing each other a lot.  I am wondering what i should do.  I dont want to breakup with her because i am not very attractive, on a good day a 6, but she is sooo beautiful and amazing.  I really wouldnt be able to do better than her, which makes only seeing her once a week even harder.  I just don't know what to do.  The second question i have is about her and her friend.  I live in Pennsylvania, about a 15 minute drive to new jersey.  But my girlfriends best friend is going to be moving to new york city for school in a week.  Because my girlfriend and her are best friends, they're both taking it pretty hard.  I really hate it when my girlfriend is sad and lately with her best friends move to new york city its been happening more and more often.  I want to know if there is a way that i can make her feel better about this move.  I would really appreciate any help.
