MAURICE: Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
ELLEN: Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
MAURICE: You don't think I love you?
ELLEN: I want to be shown... Maurice would you do anything for me?
MAURICE: Yes.
ELLEN: Anything?
MAURICE: What do you want from me? Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you? Yes... Yes I would. You know that.
ELLEN: No I don't. I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me.
