I was so excited for college and now I'm possibly dying
yay for literally the saddest ever title.

throw away because i don't want this on my actual account. many of you have probably interacted with me through this community. i've certainly been here enough to warrant that.

now, it all seems pointless.

recently I'd been coughing a lot. *A lot.* got myself checked in a hospital, and the reports  came back saying i have cysts on my lungs or something. my doctors are telling me it's kinda rare and that my lungs may collapse at any time, and even surgery is super risky and may not work out too well.

basically, i have a fair chance of dying. yay.

Before the report, all i could think about were colleges and an amazing future, and now i may not have that.

i'm not even sure why i'm writing this, but i refuse to tell any of my friends yet (they have their entrance examinations and applications to focus on, I'll tell them eventually) and boy howdy is my family does taking this well (can you blame them?).

i needed to get this off my chest somewhere (on that note, WHAT THE FUCK, NON CORPOREAL DIETY GOVERNING MY LIFE?!?!? WHAT THE LITERAL FUCK??! sorry) 

This community is awesome and super supportive and been such a huge part of my life these last few weeks, so it seemed like the right place to write this. I'll probably delete this later, sorry for messing up your day with my weepiness.

tl;dr was excited about colleges, found out i'm maybe dying and now i'm just sad, confused, eating a whole tub of ice cream and deflecting way too hard with humor
