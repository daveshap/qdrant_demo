Nearly risked my job today while trying to get a promotion. Is there any chance of recovering?
Its been a very bad week. I had an off day a couple of days ago and made made many mistakes that my manager was not happy about. Today I made a great comeback amd my boss said that I was doing amazing and I was sure I would get promoted. Although at the end of the day I was humiliated in the work groupchat when our closing shift was looking for the keys... I opened the store. Very serious problem.  And of course, the person I am competing the position with had spare ones saved the day and my boss praised her. How can I bounce back? What is gold to a manger's ears?
 Please help me destress I cannot sleep
