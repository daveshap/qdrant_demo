Hippotragine Antelopes: A Suitable Alternative For Actual Horses? The hippotragines are a small subfamily of antelopes that bear physical resemblance to horses.  There are three separate genera--Hippotragus, Oryx and Addax.  As grazers, rather than browsers, the \"Hippo\" in Hippotraginae refers to the slightly horse-like characteristics of body size and proportions: long legs and a solid body with a relatively thick muscular neck. What's more, they are built for environmental extremes and live lives that might be suitable for domestication:The Arabian Oryx, as the name suggests, lives in the hostile deserts of the Arabian Peninsula, and it lives in mixed-sex herds of 2-15 (though herds numbering 100 have been reported.)  The Scimitar Oryx can go for a long time without water and can even thrive in temperatures too high for most other mammals, hence their natural location in the Sahara Desert.  The Gemsbok lives in herds of 10-40, led by one dominant male alongside a few other subordinate males.The Addax gets all the moisture it needs from the plants it eats and, like the Arabian Oryx, lives in mixed-sex herds.So the question is, can any of the listed species be suitable alternatives for horses in the art of domesticating for the sake of cavalry?  Or do they have personalities that would make domestication not worth the effort?
