Does my humanities MA give me any kind of edge in job hunting?
Long story short, I wanted to be a German professor. For many reasons, both professional and personal, I decided to leave academia and master out of my program.

Now I have an MA in German Studies and I have my eyes on a couple fields: HR and/or logistics.  My question: does having an advanced degree give me any kind of edge in the job market?  Does anyone have any experience leveraging an MA into getting an entry-level job (especially a humanities degree)?  It doesn't have to be about getting into the two fields I mentioned, but after months of job hunting, I just want to hear other people's experiences and advice if only for the sake of knowing I'm not alone.
