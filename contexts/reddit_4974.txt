Am i only one in the world who has no friends IRL.
 I hate it when i see other people with their so-called "BFF" and when i see people on social media showing off their adventures and support for each other while i'm sitting here alone in my own darkness and thinking during my terrible time in high school and was close to becoming the next Columbine shooter to get rid of the popular kids now called normies by today's standards and i wish Hollywood would stop making teen sitcoms because they are riddled with friendships when in reality most people including myself don't have any friends at all and they try to make us look bad and i wish that i had real true friends but unfortunately that's not going to happen anytime soon.
