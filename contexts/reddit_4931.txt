Everything was going great and then it went downward spiral
I don't know what to do and it's too early for me to be crying. But my ex (who I still love and care for so much) just messaged me this morning asking to hang out because he's moving and we might not see each other again.

Background of the story: we broke up maybe 2 weeks ago and he's been battling depression, hence why I am here to learn more and help him about his situations. Never thought I would be the one actually seeking help here for myself. (I can't really think of anything else right now, I'm too sad about it).

I don't know, but I feel so down and broken right now. I just need someone to talk to about this and I don't know what else..
