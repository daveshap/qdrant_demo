LENNY: Okay, let's get you wired up. I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
EDUARDO: What's all this squid shit?
LENNY: Superconducting QUantum Interference Device. SQUID. Got it? There's gonna be a test.
EDUARDO: Hey, fuck you, man.
LENNY: Easy, Eduardo, easy. Preserve a sense of humor at all times. Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder. See we call it being wired
EDUARDO: Yeah, right.
LENNY: Some tips. Don't dart your eyes around. Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself. OK? You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event. But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn. And don't act natural. Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on. Got it?
EDUARDO: No problem.
LENNY: A star is born.
