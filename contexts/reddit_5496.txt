I'd prefer to leave by job and work elsewhere in Accounting since it's what I taught myself but I don't feel my knowledge is legit nor do I feel educationally qualified.
So I'm reaching out today because I've decided to quit my job sometime in the future but I haven't the slightest idea how to quit or even how to begin looking elsewhere for work since I have, what I feel, is basically nothing to show potential employers. Like, I understand I do a lot and both my boss and my co-workers routinely tell me I'm "not allowed to leave" and if I do, "the company won't last ten years." It's always said with a solemn tone and tbh I'm a little tired if hearing it.

I'm 30 years old. I've been at this company nearly six years. I was hired through a temp agency. I have never had a different job nor have I ever had an interview. I have learned a lot through this company though. For the sake of easier reading, I'll try to bullet point this out.

- I spent the first two years working as a grunt in the production department. The boss and I got along about as well as oil and water and our screaming matches could often be heard over the deafening sounds of the machines. Nevertheless, I was kept because I often out-worked my co-workers. What took them three days to complete, took me only one. I'm not saying this to brag; it's what was told me as the sole reason for hiring me and what continues to be the reason as to why they keep me on.
- Due to the irreconcilable differences between the boss and I, HR (who doubles as my current boss) intervened and gave me a position in the office. Due to having zero prior job experience and zero education (other than a GED which I don't have a copy of), I was supposed to be their filing clerk. This company still uses an outdated paper filing system so I have six large rooms I must maintain to ensure every employee can find the paperwork they're looking for. I must also cull through the files at the end of each year because we only keep seven years worth.
- Two weeks after my transfer another employee unexpectedly quit. Her Accounts Payables duties were split between me and another co-worker. My new partner received all of the training from the departing co-worker because she already had prior experience. I didn't get any training whatsoever. Unfortunately I soon discovered my new partner felt this was entirely unfair and she should not be required to do these duties. It has been an astronomical learning curve but over these past four years I've taken away from her nearly every single aspect of Payables and single-handedly run this dept myself. The only thing I don't do is print the checks each month.
- 3 weeks ago my boss informed me that this same co-worker has been discovered to be slacking in her Receivables duties for the past three years. It is now my job to rectify our customer's accounts of their past due balances and open credits. No, I will not receive any training nor will my co-worker be punished. This is a moot point anyways because I have already resolved all of the accounts.
- Because a different co-worker is getting older in years, I have also been rather unceremoniously tossed into the position of being a back-up receptionist. I answer calls, transfer folks where they need to be, take messages, etc.
- In addition to these duties, I also do a lot of things which go unnoticed by my boss. I have a lot of freedom in my position tbh. I print labels, I type up paperwork, I maintain our first aid cabinets, I have the flexibility and training to help in multiple departments (inventory control, production, and shipping) due to me being tossed in those departments any time my ex-boss and I were fighting, I can receive in mail, I order products for various projects I need and charge them to my co-workers company's credit card, etc.

I guess my fear is that I may have my GED but I technically did not progress past the 9th grade so I don't feel well educationally qualified. I don't have the funds to go back to school. A lot of what I do know, I've taught myself but I don't even feel confident in this knowledge because this company is ridiculously outdated. (We still use electric typewriters on a daily basis except for my co-worker who still uses a real, old-fashioned typewriter.) This company is family-run and well respected in its field so I do have that going for me though.

If I looked for another job, would I even be considered for an Accounting position? How would I even explain to potential new employers the extent of what I do know without it sounding so far left-field (which is how I feel like it comes across)? I am currently paid nearly twice the current minimum wage. Could I get this again if I left and became employed elsewhere? Honestly I'd rather not stay in this wretched place any longer than need be but I never thought I'd want to leave so desperately. Until this past year, I have never really thought about it. Now that it is in my thoughts every day though, I'm completely at a loss on what to do, what to expect, or where to even start. And should I even leave? How would I present this to my boss who, I know, would be distraught? I'm sure they'll ask me what it'll take me to stay so how I can say it's just time for me to move on? (The motto of this company is, "It'll drive you to drink," which is what I'm currently struggling with as well because my drinking has increased ten-fold. This has been incredibly detrimental to my mental health but I've been reluctant to leave because I need the money.) Am I even required to give them a reason on why I'm leaving? Finally, when I leave for a week or more, at least five co-workers must step in and cover for me so do I need to let my boss know more than two weeks in advance before I quit?

I've never had any prior experience with any of this so I'm rather at a loss in this matter.
