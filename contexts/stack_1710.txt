Removing the smallest supply decoupling capacitors in multilayer boards Hello  I want to make PCB for ADF5901 24GHz power amplifier, it says use 3 capacitor for each supply pin, 10pF, 1nF and 100nF. we have about 6 supply pin.Can we remove 10pf bypass from all pins, If using 4 layer board with 2 parallel power plane?How we can become sure that this is correct decision?Answer that I've found from guys advise and answer, the engineers world is EV-boards and manufacturers recommendation, specially if you have no test equipment and time.
