I think my fiancée is going to leave
I met her last June and we started dating a couple days later. We hit it off very quickly and had great chemistry. A month after we started dating, her boss who she was close with, killed himself. She’s never totally recovered from that. Then this year we got engaged at our 1 year anniversary. Since then it’s been a run of just hard things. Her brother was limiting her contact with her nieces, which the oldest was like a younger sister. That was a hard patch and then last month they moved 700 miles away and she likely won’t get to see them. The oldest doesn’t turn 18 for 3 more years. I’ve tried to be there for everything and I’m not perfect. I also started a new job this year and I don’t like it. It was a mistake. 

It all came to a head yesterday. I know I can lose my cool and acting like a child I hit my fridge. Broken hand. Which of course is a trigger for her past and now has her unsure of our future. I just don’t want to think about what may happen in the next couple of days
