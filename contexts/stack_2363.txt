Gen 1&2 catchable Pokemon in Heartgold I will start playing Heartgold, but no trading will occur with outside of the game itself.My goal, except from becoming the very best ( :) ), is to catch all the available Gen 1 &amp; 2 Pokemon in this game, and evolve them as much as I can.Do you know which these Pokemon are? I cannot find a concrete list while surfing the Internet..
