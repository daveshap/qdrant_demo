A recruiter contacted me on linkedin - I am a little skeptical
Yesterday a recruiter got in touch with me on LinkedIn out of the blue. She said she had an opportunity at a client company (which is a big one in my field) and that mostly matches my skills.  


It seems legit enough, I could easily find the company she works for in google and I looked her up in some social media and she is a legit person. However, I got a little skeptical as she did not ask for my portfolio and this is an artistic role.  


Also, I am a recent graduate and this would be my first job in the field.

Maybe I am just being paranoid, but idk...
