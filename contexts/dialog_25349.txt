GALLATIN: What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
PICARD: Do you know how to disable the injector?
GALLATIN: But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
PICARD: If we could lure him away from the bridge...
GALLATIN: It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
PICARD: What if he doesn't realize something's happening... Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help...
