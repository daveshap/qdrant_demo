Lost 100% of my trust and respect for my girlfriend [21]after a cruel prank.
Last week my girlfriend was on a 5 day vacation with her friends, on day 1 she thought it would be a hilarious prank to announce that she is pregnant via text and obviously encouraged all of her friends to play along with it just to wind me up. She told me she was planning to keep the baby, doesn't believe in abortions and all that stuff. When she got back she revealed to me that it was all just a hilarious prank and gave nothing but a half assed apology after I told me how she made me feel over the week.

The first day I was panicking so hard I was vomiting and on the verge of tears, I genuinely thought she was pregnant. Obviously I told my parents and friends because I have absolutely no clue how to deal with what I was going through. By the end of the week I finally come to terms with what was going on and accepted that I might have a child.

She has absolutely no clue why what she did was so terrible, I haven't been able to speak to her since.
