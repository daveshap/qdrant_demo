Boot my Ubuntu external drive on every computer I have a problem, I installed Kubuntu on my 4TB external drive, and used it on my computer. My goal was to be able to boot it on every computer. The only computer I had at the time was a macbook and when I was starting grub an error message appeared, so I thought it was somehow related to the fact that it is an Apple product. But when I got back home, I tried the external drive on other computers, none of them worked and they all showed the same error message. I searched a solution with no success. The only thing I've found is something about video drivers. And, indeed, I had to install Nvidia's drivers in order for my computer to have a correct resolution, which could explain why it only boots on this computer. I haven't tried to change the driver and boot on another computer yet, but it seems to me the most obvious reason. All that brings me to my questions:Is there an universal video driver that could work with all GPU (Including the GTX1060 I have in the initial computer)?Is there a way to change the driver depending on the computer we are booting on?Is there another problem to you?Or maybe another way to solve my issue?Thanks for your time.
