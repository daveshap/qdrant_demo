Should I leave my degree off applications and resume when applying to minimum wage jobs?
I have a BA in biology- job search is not going well so I’m think about taking a certification class to enhance my resume and skills.

In the meantime, I’m trying to get a third shift job so I can go to class in the day but still make some money at night. I currently work fast food but hate it and need to leave.

I was thinking about trying to get a job at a gas station or convenience store on overnight shifts. Should I take my BA degree off my resume and applications? I’ve heard that when places think you’re “overqualified” they’ll be less likely to hire you.
