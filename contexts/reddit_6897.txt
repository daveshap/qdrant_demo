Are you always at a risk of losing your job in any job?
I had a pretty bad experience in my previous company where I was terminated during my probation but from the very beginning of my time I was always reminded that I maybe fired if I donâ€™t meet expectations. So everyday I used to wake up in fear of doing something wrong and not being able to fully concentrate on the tasks in hand.

Is this common for every workplace though? Or is it only me who had a pretty bad couple of months?
