Today I realised that the only person who has ever got me, is me. I used to need reassurance from people around me that I am going to be okay, but the only person I ever needed to hear it from was myself.
When I’m anxious and slowly feel myself starting to spiral down into my anxious thoughts, I was always reaching out to other people, just needing to hear someone tell me I’m going to be okay. Now I have realised the only person I need to hear those words from are myself. I am slowly learning that a lot of the time it really is mind over matter; and oh boy, is my mind strong. I don’t need to depend on other people to reassure me I am okay. I can’t. I need to break the cycle. 
I feel I have come so far. I can sit there and tell myself I am going to be okay, and I can sort of believe it. It is so fucking hard to do, and it is so exhausting. I know each time I can do this I am making myself stronger. 

I don’t know why I am posting this. I guess I just had a sudden outburst of feeling somewhat empowered.
