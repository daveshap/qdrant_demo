ELLIOT: Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
NICKY: I don't want to hear about it.
ELLIOT: A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
NICKY: Shut up, Elliot.
ELLIOT: Quietly effective.
NICKY: You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
ELLIOT: Press a button and they give us money.
NICKY: Ride with me. We need a haircut.
ELLIOT: How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
NICKY: She wants a divorce.
ELLIOT: Don't talk like that.
NICKY: It's over, finished and done with.
ELLIOT: That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
NICKY: I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
ELLIOT: But didn't we know it would happen?
NICKY: Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
ELLIOT: Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
DRIVER: We must abandon.
NICKY: What do you mean, we must abandon?
DRIVER: Ruptured steam pipe.
