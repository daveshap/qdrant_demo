LONGSHANKS: What news of the north?
EDWARD: Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
LONGSHANKS: While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
EDWARD: I have ordered conscriptions...
EDWARD: Wallace has sacked York!
LONGSHANKS: Impossible. How dare you bring a panicky lie.
