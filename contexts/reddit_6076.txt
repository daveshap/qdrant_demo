Would an employer be understanding if someone else were to drop off your resume while you’re in isolation?
I’ve been out of a job for 4 months now (quit my job and moved at a bad time) I’ve been able to use savings to pay for everything but I am in need of a job badly. I live in a very small town (2000 people) and a place I am interested in is hiring but only allows applying in person, however, I just had surgery and am high risk for covid-19 so I am self isolating and my roommate is the only one who leaves the house and I would like him to drop off my resume at this place. Would this be inappropriate? Or should I just wait until I am able to go in myself? I’ve already tried calling to ask if they accept emailed resumes but they never ended up getting back to me.
