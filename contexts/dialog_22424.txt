MARY: Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
CLAY: Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
MARY: But you eat, don't you?
CLAY: Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
MARY: Where do you keep the can opener?
CLAY: In the grub box. Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
