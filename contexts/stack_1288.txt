Replacing 2 prong with 3 prong outlet Recently I have been replacing my 2 prong outlets with 3 prong. I found out it is dangerous to have an open ground 3 prong. To update this to code I am wondering if it is ok to put a gfci in the most upstream receptacle of the circuit, so the ungrounded 3 prongs will be up to code and safer, I am also wondering if the ungrounded 3 prongs that are on the gfci circuit need to be tamper resistant? My county uses the 2014 NEC code. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
