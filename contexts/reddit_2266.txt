Didn’t get in to my dream school and I’m...grateful?
My dad went to Stanford. I have been attending reunions, football and soccer games, and other events on campus since before I can remember. I even met Elon Musk, one of my idols, there. I’ve been wearing Stanford sweatshirts since 4th grade and my house is littered with Stanford shit. At a very young age, I made it my goal to attend the school, and as I grew up, I fell deeper in love with it and envisioned my life there. Stanford was my dream school in every sense of the word. 

Yesterday, I was rejected. Obviously, I didn’t expect to get in, but the rejection was initially painful nonetheless.

As time passed and I gained distance from the news, a few things crossed my mind. Anyone who has or will face a college rejection should consider these things:
- As we travel through life, we find ourselves facing forks in the road at important moments. One of these roads was just blocked. I have little doubt that the path we find ourselves on will be more beautiful than we ever could’ve imagined, and that we will be incredibly grateful for the rejection in the long run.
- We know our accomplishments. We know how hard we’ve worked. We know how good of a friend we are, the joy and laughter we bring to others, the contributions we make in and out of the classroom. Don’t let a college be the source of your validation. Recognize the things that make you awesome, and understand that the amazing people in your life are a reflection of who you are. 
- Just because we didn’t get in doesn’t mean we aren’t smart or accomplished enough to do well there or that we aren’t smarter or harder working than the people who go there. Considering the other people from my school who got in, I know that for a fact lol.
- FIDO: Fuck it and drive on. No point dwelling on it except to learn from the situation and grow.
