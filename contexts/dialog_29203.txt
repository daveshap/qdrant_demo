MAVERICK: What do you do when you come here?
CHARLIE: I sit. I think. I play games.
MAVERICK: What kind of games?
CHARLIE: I like to play reality"."
MAVERICK: How do you play reality.
CHARLIE: It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
MAVERICK: Strip reality! How do you play that?
CHARLIE: It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing. One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
MAVERICK: You're crazy. That's a pretty silly game.
CHARLIE: Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
CHARLIE: Want to play the game?
MAVERICK: How does it go?
CHARLIE: You say the truth. Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
MAVERICK: What truth?
CHARLIE: The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
MAVERICK: Goose is dead.
CHARLIE: True.
MAVERICK: Now?
CHARLIE: Take something off.
MAVERICK: Off me or off you?
CHARLIE: That's up to you.
