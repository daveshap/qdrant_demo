attaching an external device: udev, hal, dbus and ... mini-ubuntu If I've well understood, in the modern linux distributions, attaching an external device (usb stick or ide/sata hard disk) to a PC, Udev, HAL and Dbus allows to manage it.udev - identify the hardware component which is plugged into and run a specific application, Dbus - is used for inter-process communicationHAL - gets information from the Udev service, notifying the corresponding desktop application to open the mounted device.QUESTION:I want to install mini-ubuntu to have a basic configuration that avoid the previous steps (autorun, automount, autoplay, ecc...).Please, can you tell me what happen when I attach an external device in a minimal Ubuntu configuration ? that is, in other words, which is the process'chain informing Ubuntu kernel that an external device has been attached ?Thanks in advance.
