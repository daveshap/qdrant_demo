Apple spaces switching screens after sleeping I have a 2017 Macbook Pro. I connect to two external screens via a Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock HD. They are arranged external|external|internal left to right. I have my 'menu bar' dragged to the far left external screen in the Displays preference pane, which is where I want my dock (on the far left hand side).My issue is that whenever I wake the machine from sleep, the internal and central screen switch spaces, which is infuriating as I have to drag them all back to the correct place all the time.Some other places say try switching the screen the menu bar is on, but this isn't appropriate for me as it would move my dock position.I have 'Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use' disabled in Mission Control settings.Is there any way to solve this problem, so that the spaces remain on their correctly affiliated screens, or failing that a quick way I can (preferably with a keyboard shortcut) cause the spaces on screens 2/3 to switch all in one go without the laborious dragging of up to six spaces back and forth?
