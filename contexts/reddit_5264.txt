My co-worker is trying to get me fired.
I work at the corporate office for a large gym and handle things such as customer service related issues and also schedule times for people to stop into the gym and possibly get memberships set up. There are about 10 people that work in the corporate office and we are all quite good friends.

The way my job works is that us workers at corporate schedule appointments/answer questions for the multiple gyms we have scattered throughout a couple of states. From there, if a potential client decides to go into the gym after we schedule them; it is completely up to the gym workers there. We just get people there and move on. However, there is a certain manager at a gym, let's call him Dan, who has been giving me nothing but a hard time lately.

The first incident was over something that wasn't at all my fault. Dan sent out an email to 3  people: My boss (let's call him Ted), my assistant manger (calling him Kyle), and me. This email claimed that I had "yelled" and "cursed out" an employee at their gym over deleting some of my records. I am not one to yell or even raise my voice, I cry way too easily. I did call over to the gym and ask why my records were disappearing since they were associated with that particular gym, and they weren't able to give me a solid answer as to why. And contrary to Dan's claim, their assistant manager actually yelled at ME, claiming she didn't do anything wrong. My boss talked to me and apologized on behalf of that ridiculous claim I received, saying that he had Kyle talk to Dan about why he accused me of such a thing, and he admitted it was their error since they were tidying up the systems (which is a part of MY job, no theirs). Also me yelling? Well we record ALL of the calls we receive, including the ones from fellow gyms, and the assistant manager who yelled at me got a warning for her behavior towards me.

I thought that was the end of Dan, but today I got yet another email. Addressed to only Ted, Kyle, and I. No one else in my office.

>***"Can we make it clear to (my name) that someone can not come in and set up a pass for their significant other? We need a waiver signed and if they have no intention of joining then we should not book appointmentsÂ for a spouse to come in and get a "free 5 day pass". We book appointments with the intention to join (isn't wanting to pick up some paperwork for her husband to sign an "intention to join"?), not so anyone can come pick up a pass for a friend or spouse."***

However, once again, this was a false claim. You CAN book for someone to come in and pick up paperwork for someone at the gym. I asked all of my co-workers and they agreed that they have all done the same and have never gotten scolded for doing so. All they're doing is picking up paperwork for someone to sign ***with the intention to join***; there's nothing in our manual about that, at least nothing that my co-workers or I were made aware of. Maybe there is in the gym rule book, but NOT ours. If there was, I see no reason why Dan would send out yet another email to my boss, assistant manager and I only instead of calling me directly and discussing it. Instead he had to call me out. I don't see his logic behind it, and upon talking to my co-workers, they didn't either and all agreed that he was trying to get me in unnecessary trouble.

My boss didn't talk to me this time about it. He just replied to the email saying "I'll talk to her". But now he's out of the office and I don't believe I will be receiving said talking to. I think my boss knows full well what Dan is trying to do here just because he is mad that his previous lie got called out, however it still makes me feel very on edge.

**Edit**: Dan just got reported to HR for harassing one of my corporate co-workers who came into his gym just to work out last night.
