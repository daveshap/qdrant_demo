Military spouse leaving the field for two years and then want to get back
I graduated with my masters in May 2018. We moved to Hawaii and I started a job as an academic advisor immediately. With the new supervisor my mental and emotional health has gone down the drain.
I’ve addressed my concerns with my supervisor who took no responsibility and no ownership of his inability to see me as an equal to my colleague because of my age. In Hawaii, age discrimination laws only apply to 40 and up. Not less than 30.

There is a potential opportunity to work a government job at a military base as an admin (similar pay). It has NOTHING to do with student affairs, but I need to get out, and the university system is union based. You can’t get in unless it’s at the lowest position and you work your way up. I’m well overqualified and I’m only going to be here a couple more years (no time to jump around within an institution).

Long story short: how bad would it look/would you hire someone who hasn’t been at one location for more than 2 years?

1) moved from one to another for double the pay within the university
2) went to grad school
3) this is my job after grad school
4) mentally and emotionally unhealthy because of where I’m at now

There’s A LOT more to my history, so if something’s not clear, let me know.
