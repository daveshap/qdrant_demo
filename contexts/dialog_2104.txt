ELECTRA: Two way?
RATH: Transmits and receives.
ELECTRA: Cheap as shit.
RATH: I paid a lot for these.
ELECTRA: They saw you coming a mile away. If I had known we'd be using --
RATH: It's too late now. Okay? We'll have to deal with these.
ELECTRA: Fine.
RATH: This is the bank. This is the hotel. In the morning I will enter the bank.
ELECTRA: Check.
RATH: He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd. He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
ELECTRA: But he won't shoot you right then?
RATH: No. It would be amateur. A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming. Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
RATH: You'll be here. A restaurant. A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
ELECTRA: Okay. Then what?
RATH: Then, we wait.
ELECTRA: Aiiee. More waiting? I don't know if I like this plan.
RATH: It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself. He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
RATH: The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed. 5:45. 5:50. He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
ELECTRA: Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
RATH: He won't be able to. He'll have to go inside. He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there. If the bank closes, he won't know for sure. He'll come. I'm sure. And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
ELECTRA: What? What if he brings it with him?
RATH: He can't. The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
ELECTRA: That means you won't have a gun.
RATH: That's right.
ELECTRA: And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
RATH: If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
ELECTRA: You'll have the money. How do I know that you won't --
RATH: I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed. You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
ELECTRA: We split the money?
RATH: Five million apiece. You get on your plane, I get on mine.
ELECTRA: Sounds pretty well figured out.
RATH: I've been thinking about it for a long time.
ELECTRA: Except --
RATH: What?
ELECTRA: Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
RATH: I told you, he will.
ELECTRA: You can't know for sure, how can you? I mean, you're not him.
RATH: I was.
RATH: Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
ELECTRA: For Nicholai?
RATH: Yes.
ELECTRA: You killed him here? In this city, outside that bank?
ELECTRA: What is it? I don't like this at all. What is going on here?
RATH: I don't know. It just happened. I was here ten years ago, I'm here now. That's it.
ELECTRA: I don't believe that.
RATH: It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear. Things happened beyond my control. I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
ELECTRA: Ten years ago.
RATH: Yes.
ELECTRA: What happened?
RATH: I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank. He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
ELECTRA: What did he want?
RATH: He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business. To disappear to some empty Greek island.
RATH: What did he say?
RATH: He said I couldn't win. That no one wins at this game.
ELECTRA: Was that it?
RATH: Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
ELECTRA: You didn't take it.
RATH: No. I went back to the hotel. And waited.
ELECTRA: Ten years later, here you are again.
RATH: Yes. Here I am again.
