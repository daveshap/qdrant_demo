High School Graduate - New Job, what to do, and what not to?
Hello fine folks of reddit! 
I graduated High School, and have gotten my first 9-5 job(I started last week). The  term job is suppepose to end in august, but it has been quite a rough start, and the tools and skills I have to learn ( manufacturer job) is  a lot. I feel like I have not been doing anything productive the past few days, and I do not even know if I can finish the project they set me to do. I am stressing over it after work, and cannot even seem to relax, mostly I  do not even know how to act in a job setting. Should I just quit or, is there any approach I can take to be a better co-worker?
