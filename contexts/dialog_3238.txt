ADAM: Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
BARBARA: Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
ADAM: God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
BARBARA: Oh no.
ADAM: It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
JANE: Hi, Barb! I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
BARBARA: That's right, Jane. Complete vacation.
JANE: Honey -- today I am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
BARBARA: No! Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
JANE: Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real! From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
BARBARA: Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
JANE: You could double the size of your hardware store! You'll be rich.
BARBARA: And live in what, our station wagon?
JANE: Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now. This house is too big. It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
JANE: Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
BARBARA: 'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
