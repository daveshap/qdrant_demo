I finally made a doctors appointment on my own!
I have general anxiety and social and really hate making phone calls as most people with anxiety do but today I finally made a appointment on my own .My husband usually calls stuff for me but I'm tired of letting this control me. I've been having some health issues and keep putting off going but I know I need to go.I was so nervous to call at first but then I realized theres no reason its not like she was judging me and even if she is who cares.I was so proud of myself all day for something normal adults do all the time lol. My appointment isn't for 3 weeks which sucks and now I'm a little nervous for that but I know I can get through it. We always make things out to be worst than they end up being, its so weird.
