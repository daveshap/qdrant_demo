BRODY: I got something for you to do tomorrow.
MIKE: I kind of had plans....
BRODY: Sailing? Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats.
MIKE: Hey, come on....
BRODY: No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there. You can work until school starts.
ELLEN: All summer?
BRODY: He wanted a job, he's got one. I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
