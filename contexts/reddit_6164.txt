I was just hired with the county and having in-person onboarding and training tomorrow, but as my luck would have it I have started to not feel well. Can they rescind their job offer if I tell them I am sick and need to reschedule?
I have a feeling they would not just fire me over being sick, especially with the state of current affairs. But I really want this job and am super paranoid they will not want to wait the 2 weeks if I need to quarantine. Obviously I will not risk getting others sick just for a job but am looking for some words of encouragement that they won't fire me.
