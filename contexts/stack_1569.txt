Single tone signal generation at microwave frequency with best phase noise and spurious performance What is the best way to generate a single tone signal with best phase noise and spurious performance?Is frequency multiplication the best way? single stage multiplication or multi stage multiplication?I want to produce a single tone 6 GHz signal with a 100 MHz Sine Wave OCXO by multi stage multiplication.For best phase noise and spurious performance what issues are important to notice?Best Regards.Thanks.
