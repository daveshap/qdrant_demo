Peltier temperature change speed I currently have four 12V 6A peltiers connected to PID's, heatsinks, a power supply and I use Labview program to control them. What I want to achieve is changing the temperature of the Peltier devices from 35 degrees C to 15 degrees C under 10 seconds. It seems like Peltier devices can't keep up with the changes in voltage, always follow with a delay and reach the desired temperature a little bit later than I want. I need suggestions for this. What causes this delay? With what kind of equipment, input changes I can fix the problem? How to decrease the temperature change time in Peltier devices?
