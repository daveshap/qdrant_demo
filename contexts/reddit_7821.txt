What is the best reference manager out there and how do you personally use it?
I am in my first year of a science PhD program and Iâ€™m starting to collect literature for my project.

I would like to use a reference manager that allows me to save PDFs of the article along with a short summary I can add to know why I saved the reference. 

Let me know your thoughts on what you use and how it makes your life easier. Thanks!
