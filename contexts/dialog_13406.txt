EDDIE: So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
BERT: I'm a businessman, kid.
EDDIE: Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
BERT: Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
EDDIE: Fifty per cent?
BERT: No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
EDDIE: We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
BERT: Aaaahhhh!
EDDIE: Boy, we really gave it to her good.
BERT: If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
EDDIE: And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
