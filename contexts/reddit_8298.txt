By what measure(s) is the Southern Border in 'crisis'? Is the wall intended to address any of these crises?
[President Trump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1082347305699889157) announced he will hold a prime-time Presidential address on Tuesday to discuss: 

> "*...the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border.*"

The President's [Press Secretary also announced](https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1082319456246923267) that on Thursday the President will travel to the border to: 

> "*...meet with those on the frontlines of the national security and humanitarian crisis.*"

The Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, has also used the term 'crisis' [to describe issues arising from the Southern border](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/29/dhs-chief-blames-congress-courts-humanitarian-crisis-border-kirstjen-nielsen-donald-trump/2440143002/).

> “The system is clearly overwhelmed and we must work together to address this humanitarian crisis and protect vulnerable populations,” Nielsen said...

> “We know that if Congress were to act, or the courts were to enforce the law as written, we could address this crisis tomorrow. Instead we continue to do more with less.

> “As I have said before, I ask Congress to please put politics aside and recognize this for the growing security and humanitarian crisis it is.” 

In the past, the President has been accused of [inflating data or using misleading language](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/fact-check-7-things-trump-got-wrong-about-border-immigration-n940516) to promote his message of the urgency that the Southern border needs to be addressed.

In short, the President and his administration are making the case of [a crisis at the border](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/03/conway-border-democrats-1078291) while Democrats are saying the [administration's assertions are inaccurate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-address-border-visit.html) and third party observers argue a real 'crisis' exists in [policy the wall isn't designed to address](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trumps-failure-to-address-the-real-crisis-at-the-border).

I have a few questions:

1: What is the measure of the 'crisis' that the administration is pointing to?

2: Is there any evidence or arguments a wall would address the crises the Trump administration has highlighted?

3: In a historical context, do any of the metrics the Trump administration point to show evidence of a new or developing crisis?
