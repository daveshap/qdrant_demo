TONY: What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk. I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
VINCENT: You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
TONY: All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
SAM: Gaelic.
TONY: You sure?
SAM: I'm sure.
VINCENT: Can you get it?
TONY: The Russian would be easier.
SAM: Why's that?
TONY: Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
SAM: It's the Irish tape we want.
TONY: Gonna be tough.
TONY: Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
SAM: Seamus Reilly.
VINCENT: You know him?
SAM: I know of him.
TONY: Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand. Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
VINCENT: I get the picture.
VINCENT: Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
TONY: I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
VINCENT: It's a matter of respect. Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
SAM: The Irish representative?
VINCENT: Yes.
SAM: What's this?
VINCENT: The address of the Russian production company. Just in case we need to find them.
SAM: Thorough man.
SAM: You sure your friend got the right place?
VINCENT: If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
VINCENT: Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
SAM: Do what?
VINCENT: Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
SAM: It's my job.
VINCENT: Then quit. You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
SAM: Sure I do. You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
VINCENT: It's a cover, then. A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint. You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer.
SAM: I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed. I do dark ops.
VINCENT: Dark ops?
SAM: Dark operations. Wet work. Kidnaping. Assassination.
VINCENT: Very ugly.
SAM: It is at that.
VINCENT: Not very zen of you, huh? Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
SAM: I never made that claim.
VINCENT: I know. Jean-Pierre did.
SAM: You were behind the door?
VINCENT: I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
SAM: You would have done that?
VINCENT: I would have tried not to. But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
SAM: How could you have done that?
VINCENT: Because I owe you. Look at that...
