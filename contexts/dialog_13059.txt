DENISE: Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
MOTHER: No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
JERRY: Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
MOTHER: His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
JERRY: Oh, right.
MOTHER: What do they call you, sweety?
JERRY: Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
BILL: Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
DENISE: I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
