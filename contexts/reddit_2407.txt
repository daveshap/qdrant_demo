Considering quitting my job, which I interact with the same 15 people daily, to protect my elderly relative I live with. I have money saved for est. 7 years of living expenses. Would you choose the job or make sure your relative is as safe as possible and quit?
I go back and forth on this. I'm in one of those thankless jobs you fall into but stick it out for the paycheck. I'm 8 months when the pandemic hit. 15 people were considered essential, including myself. Reading the unemployment rate, I certainly having a new appreciation for just having a job and am humbled by that. It's a large building, though, and several companies are still open. So the real number I encounter, and the risk, is higher. 

On the flip side, I do have money saved and the IRS is giving me money from a mistake they uncovered so my new budget would put me at 7 years of living expenses covered. 

The concern is my mother. After the passing of my dad, I moved in with my mom to help her with little things. It's worked out surprisingly well, she's a sweetheart. 

Now I feel incredible guilt just leaving and coming home daily, putting her at risk. Her health, thankfully, is pretty good. She's a lovely person and I couldn't live with myself knowing I harmed her.

I drive under freeway signs that say to stay home.  I'm so tormented on what is the right thing to do. People scrambling to get jobs, I have a crappy one but, who cares, it's money coming in. If my mom didn't now rely on me so much, I would just move out but she does require a bit of daily care.

What do you think is the smartest move if you were faced with this? Oh, and thank you and wishing you well.
