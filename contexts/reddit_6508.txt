Is preHIRED legit?
Hass anybody heard of this company? They have a fair bit of reviews in many places that I deem worthy such a sales hacker. Their marketing at least on Facebook seems very transparent. If you complete the course on the income based repayment they will only enforce repayment if you make $60,000 OTE ormore with a base of at least 40,000. The total cost is $30,000 if you paid back at 12.5 percent of your income every month for 48 months. Faster if your income is higher than the 60,000 OTE.

I feel like this might be a pretty good idea especially for people making a fair bit less than 60,000 OTE and or people looking to break into the software business. but before I go blindly recommending them even though they have a lot of good reviews video reviews and a pretty good following in a lot of places I want to get feedback first.
