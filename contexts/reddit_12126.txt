I am a jerk and I am not quite shure how to change
Simply said I have been told that I am an ok person to talk to but I have the tendency to correct people and I can't accept opinions without expressing my own opinion and showing why it is better. It is a bad characteristic that I can work on. Does anybody else have a similar problem. I suppose I have to understand that I am not superior to other people, but for some reason it is quite hard for my dumb brain to grasp
