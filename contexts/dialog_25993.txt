JACKIE: Keep Ben's for awhile, okay? Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
ANNABELLE: Until he's old enough to read.
JACKIE: Are you afraid for me? Where I'm going.

JACKIE: Don't be. I'm going. Where we all go. Now how can that be bad.
ANNABELLE: I'll miss you so much.
JACKIE: Good. That's very good.
