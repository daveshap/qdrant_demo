INDY: Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever.""
DONOVAN: The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
INDY: The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
DONOVAN: Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail. Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
INDY: An old man's dream.
DONOVAN: Every man's dream. Including your father's, I believe.
