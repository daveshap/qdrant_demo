DAGO RED: There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
HAWKEYE: I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
DUKE: And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
HAWKEYE: Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice. It's a different ritual but it works the same.
DUKE: What do you think, Trapper?
