SEBASTIAN: You know what? I don't take it back.
ANNETTE: Why are you doing this?
SEBASTIAN: Because I'm in love with you.
ANNETTE: I thought you said we were going to be friends.
SEBASTIAN: I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
ANNETTE: I have feelings for you.
SEBASTIAN: Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
ANNETTE: That's not fair.
SEBASTIAN: Why can't we be together?
ANNETTE: You really want to know?
SEBASTIAN: Yes.
ANNETTE: It's because I don't trust myself with you. I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
