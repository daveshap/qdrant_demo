Is being passively suicidal a thing?
I’m a 14-year-old genderfluid person, and I feel what I think I can best describe as passively suicidal. I have no intention of directly killing myself, but I just don’t have any will to go on. It’s hard to articulate, but I feel kind of like if, for example, a car hit me and I was, say, bleeding out, I wouldn’t call 911 and try to save myself. Is this a thing? What should I do?
