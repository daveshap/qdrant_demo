What files can I keep to reinstall an infected system without getting infected again? I'm quite sure my Windows PC is infected beyond salvation and I want to format it and reinstall everything. However, I have a 128 GB SSD where I keep only the OS and a 1 TB hard disk where I have programs and all of my files. If I boot from Linux to save whatever I can save, what should I save and what should I be careful about completely deleting?I guess all executables are better deleted as a malware with control of the system could've replaced them with malicious versions? And what about other kind of files?In particular I'm concerned about my emulators and ROMs of retro consoles. I'll probably delete all the emulators, but are ROMs at risk? Can they easily be corrupted to become malicious software? And in general, can I keep documents, videos and music?And if any executable slips through and I don't manually execute it, could it cause any damage?
