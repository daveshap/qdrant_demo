Why "Attending Non-University Certificate or Diploma" is a requirement?
If I understand this correctly, it means people who are taking or graduated from university with a Degree/Certificate is not allow?

There are few incidents when I being ask about my education, I replied BA in business economics and the employer never reply or reject my application. I know maybe I am overqualified or whatever, but I want the job and I meet all requirements except this, why not?

Can someone explain why companies want to hire people who is attending non-university certificate or diploma?
