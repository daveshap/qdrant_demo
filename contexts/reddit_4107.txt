Why do men on dating sites insist on meeting straight away, and usually hiking?? (I'm F)
Due to personal preference and anxiety, I prefer to talk to people for at least a short while on dating sites (Tinder, OkCupid, POF, etc.) before meeting up. I've seen this labeled as "pen pal-ing" and is apparently a common frustration for men seeking women. I've also noticed a common first activity suggestion is always hiking, which I'm going to be honest, is the last place I want to go with someone I've just met, especially a man. That's how you get murdered.

The way I see it, I'm feeling out their personality to see if they're worth meeting, and to not go hiking partially because I don't like it very much, but also because I don't want to go into the woods with someone I've never met before. But apparently, this is a huge annoyance.

Men of Reddit who are on dating sites, what's your guys' take on this?



Edit: Wow this got way more attention than I thought it would!!! I just wanted to clarify a few points I see being repeated. 

1. I do live in the PNW, so hiking is a common activity here, but with that said, even on the most populated trails, there are still lulls in the by-traffic that leave plenty of opportunities for harm to be done. Not to mention nowhere on my profile have I mentioned nature nor do I have any nature pictures. Hiking is not an activity I particularly enjoy. 

2. When I say I want to feel out their personality, I dont mean weeks or months. I mean a few days of solid conversation to try to make sure they're not just looking for a hookup, and to make sure our personalities are somewhat compatible enough to be across from the table, bar, whatever. I dont want to be pen pals for months. That's boring. But I dont want the third message out of the gate to be "let's go out" or "can I have your number." Give me just a half a second!

Thanks for all your replies!!
