WELL-MANICURED MAN: You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
MULDER: How?
WELL-MANICURED MAN: The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years. Or it may not.
MULDER: What alien environment?
WELL-MANICURED MAN: Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
MULDER: What about you?
WELL-MANICURED MAN: My life is over. Go.
