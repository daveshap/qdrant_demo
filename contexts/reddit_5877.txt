(Canada) How important are educational institutions when it comes to getting a job?
Hey, so I'm planning on moving to Canada this year and I want to break into the international trade industry.

I'm considering studying at a Canadian institution like BCIT in order to have better access to the local labor market (making contacts, BCIT job board, etc ). 

I would like to know if paying the price of a certificate (some 7500 CAD) from an institution like that is worth it from a job search standpoint, or if I'm just better off looking for a job in the traditional way (applying directly to companies, Zip recruiter, Linkedin, etc).

For example, here in Mexico, having access to the job boards and contacts (both faculty and students) of elite universities is a game changer when it comes to gettting a high paying job, while public job boards are basically useless and have awful job offers.

On the other hand, in Spain (where I went to university) I found university job boards to be a waste of time with usually poor job postings, and few contacts to be made (most of faculty are bureaucrats without private sector experience). In Spain you're better off applying directly to companies or using public job boards.

What I want to know is if Canada is more like Mexico in this regard, or like Spain.

For anyone who studied at a Canadian institution, what ahs been your experience with this?
