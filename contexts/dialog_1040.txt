KAREN: Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
EVE: Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
ADDISON: She was magnificent.
KAREN: Then you've heard too.
ADDISON: I was there. An eyewitness.
KAREN: You were there? At the play - last night?
ADDISON: A happy coincidence.
EVE: We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
KAREN: They certainly don't waste much time.
EVE: Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
