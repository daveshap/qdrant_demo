Token FIPS 140-2 level 3 with support for Android, iPhone and Web I'm testing a SafeNet 5100 token FIPS 140-2 level 3. It comes with programs to access and manage it, but only for desktop machines.I would like to create applications that use level 3 tokens. Is there any level 3 token that provides access from Android, iPhone and web pages?  For example Nano Ledger provides apk library, and web pages access, but it's not FIPS level 3.I would like to create multiplatform apps using digital signatures from secure tokens.Thanks in advance
