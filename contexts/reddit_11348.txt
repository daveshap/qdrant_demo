Overweight and in constant pain, but everyone around me seems to think it's my fault?
Hi all, first time poster so please go easy on me.

My problem is simple: I'm 5"5, and I weigh 14 stone. According to the BMI, this means I am obese. For me, it means I'm fat, plain and simple.

Unlucky for me though, I have ongoing health problems that have been troubling me since I first hit puberty. This just so happened to be only a year or so before I started gaining weight.

Everyone in my life is constantly suggesting I'll feel better if I just lose some weight. The thing is, I've faced eating disorders multiple times now, and while it has never gotten dangerous, it is still a mentality that I could easily fall prey to again. Not only that, but I'm certain my health problems began before I gained weight, and may even be the cause of the weight gain, as exercise in general is extremely painful, and has been for years.

Despite this, the suggestion continues to be to just push through it, and if I lose some weight then I'll stop being in pain.

This endless cycle is really starting to get to me. I'm starting to think there's no end in sight. According to friends, family, and even one of the doctors I have seen recently, the only way to stop being in pain is to lose weight, but the only way I can do that is by doing the thing that causes me pain.

This catch 22 is really getting me down, and I just need someone to tell me this isn't all in my head, and I should just get over myself.

Thank you if you made it this far
