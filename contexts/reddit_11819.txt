I tried to kiss my best friend.
My on-again-off-again ex-girlfriend just broke up with me again (it's over for good now) after essentially 9 months (which in itself is a whole other story). During my relationship with her, I spent lots of time with this best friend in question and began to get very close with her. When my ex broke up with me, this best friend was there to comfort me. After a hike recently, I went in for a kiss, as I thought there were some feelings we shared. I feel like she had led me on, as we danced at a school dance (during a period where my ex and I weren't together). We had hung out alone together in the past and went on hikes and nature adventures frequently, even when my ex and I were still together, but we never made any sort of romantic physical contact. She told me that she understood where I was coming from, but told me that she couldn't. We vowed to not talk about it again, and she said that she only saw us as staying good friends. Even a few of my friends thought she had some interest in me. Basically, right now I'm upset at myself for nearly ruining one of the best friendships I've ever had. Part of me however believes that there was good reason for me to believe that she had romantic interest in me. I'm so confused and upset at myself. Ask me any questions you have. I might post my entire story to /r/relationships, as there are tons more to my story that I need help with.
