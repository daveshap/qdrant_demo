My dream job is a real nightmare. Am I being unreasonable or is my frustration justified?
Hey, guys. I’ve cried once in my adult life and today was almost the second. 

I’m in marketing, for added context

I took my dream job, or so I thought, 2 weeks ago and was stoked to begin. Everything was going pretty well, but in a couple weeks in, it all seems to be falling apart. The first red flag is that there was no formal training besides a short skype (it’s a remote job). I was left to my own devices to learn the very complex systems they use. 

I was hired at a very busy time of year so I’ve had to learn while putting out a shit ton of projects. I’ve been forced to learn by mistake and my boss is bombarding with criticism all day because I’m making mistakes (because I was never trained). Today, HR held a meeting with me and subtly said if I didn’t greatly improve I’ll be let go by next week. I’ve been here literally 2 weeks...what the fuck. 

In those two weeks I’ve completed every task and even did a co-workers tasks while she was on leave. I’ve been struggling to stay ahead so I’ve been working 12+ hour days to keep up. I’m exhausted. 

This is a nightmare and I will be horribly ashamed if I leave this job. But seeing how burnt out everyone is and the insane hours they work, I’m learning that the good pay might not be worth it. 

Anyone else go through this?
