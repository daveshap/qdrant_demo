Just got a job that pays me 17.50/hr
I’m really happy I’m a  21 year old  college drop out when I got the opportunity to work for a molding company. I’m making 17.50/ hour working 40 hours a week I’m finally able to pay my bills and have some money left over 

Edit:Wow I didn’t expect to get some silver! Thank you so much 😁😁
