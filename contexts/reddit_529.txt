Looking 4 genuine friends
I just moved to Toronto 2 years ago and never make genuine friend. I feel like i was out of place most of the time whenever their group of friends arrive which they have known since the  beginning. I think i'm putting effort to be belong but somehow i still feel it.

Mid 20's and asian. I just wanna change my daily routine of work,home and dota. Any advice ?
