BUDDY: Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
ROSE: Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
BUDDY: Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
ROSE: What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
BUDDY: There was this old man that ate his niece.
ROSE: I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
BUDDY: He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
ROSE: I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
BUDDY: Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
ROSE: Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio.
BUDDY: Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
DOLL: Oh, shut up, Buddy.
