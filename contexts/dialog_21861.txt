GUNNISON: Read some good books.
JEFF: I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
GUNNISON: I'll send you some comic books.
JEFF: Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
GUNNISON: Like what?
JEFF: I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
GUNNISON: It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
JEFF: Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
GUNNISON: Jeff -- wives don't nag anymore -- they discuss.
JEFF: Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
GUNNISON: Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
JEFF: Next time, have some good news.
