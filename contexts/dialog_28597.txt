RESTON: How's my favorite President?
KENNY: Busy. But you've got his heart.
RESTON: I want an hour with him.
KENNY: I said his heart, not his attention.
RESTON: Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
KENNY: Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
RESTON: I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
