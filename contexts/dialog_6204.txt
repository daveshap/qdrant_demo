ALEX: Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
CATLADY: What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
ALEX: Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
CATLADY: Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
ALEX: Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
CATLADY: No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
ALEX: You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
CATLADY: Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. He rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.
