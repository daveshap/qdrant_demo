What should I do about my friend who thinks Stanford is real
[My friend thinks](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cn4hlx/what_do_i_do_about_friend_who_thinks_duke_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) Stanford is real and is only applying there. I keep trying to tell him to look at other schools because Stanford doesnâ€™t exist. What should l do? His stats are in top 25% for t20s.
