Used Air (2010) without OS - how can I get up and running? I've picked up a used 2010 Macbook Air. The previous owner seems to have wiped OS X leaving me with only the 'OS X Utilities' application available. I can't use the install option as I receive the 'This item is not available' after signing into the App Store. I've tried creating a bootable USB of 10.6 (original OS) and 10.11 (last installed OS) but either get a Kernel Panic or a stop sign respectively. I've also tried the 'Internet Recovery' option, but can't seem to access it on boot - I've heard it may not be installed.I don't have access to another Mac - only PC.I'm using TransMac for Windows to create the bootable USB. It initially appears successful at setting up the drive but when booting the errors appear.How can I set this machine up?Your help is much appreciated
