JAMES LEER: I'm not going with them.
GRADY: James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
JAMES LEER: I'm not going, with them.
GRADY: James, like it or not, they're your parents.
JAMES LEER: Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
