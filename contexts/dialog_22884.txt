UPHAM: Good luck, Captain.
MILLER: Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
UPHAM: The men said, nine.
MILLER: What do they know? I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out. Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud. I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
UPHAM: That only leaves three.
MILLER: Plenty.
