SUZIE: Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
ROD: Like what?
SUZIE: Like your guitar break.
ROD: It's coming right up. After the third verse.
SUZIE: Second verse!
ROD: Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
KEITH: You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
ROD: Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
KEITH: What the fuck you talking about, man?
SUZIE: He's right. You were behind.
