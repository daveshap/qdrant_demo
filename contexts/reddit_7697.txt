I feel so dumb .. :(
I just finished my first PhD year . And looking back, I feel I did not achieve anything. I am 27 years old. I like to read a little bit the biography of the scientists , who shaped my field. Like Leonhard Euler... he already got his masters at the age of 16.. and many other scientists... and I am here just struggling to come up with any little innovative idea for my thesis. And then I end up spending more than half ,of my defined 40 working hours , just surfing the internet .... and then I read how other PhD students work up to 60 hours a week and then I feel even worse. Don't get me wrong I love my field, I love to gain new knowledge, but at the moment I just feel so dumb and like an embarrassment ....Where do all this people get their energy ? 

Edit :
I want to thank everyone who commented on this post. I read every reply carefully and was surprised how your words made me relax a bit . I want to achieve great research and not be one of the people who spend the last years of their young life doing something no one really cared for . Of course I will never be like Euler , Gau√ü and Markow, and it is ridicules to compare myself to them , but deep in my heart I wish I  could be so brilliant ... where they so brilliant because they worked a lot (which I fail to do ) or because they were super intelligent (which I am not ) ... and do you think is most important quality when it comes to being a PHD student ?
