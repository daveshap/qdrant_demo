Does TLS protocol make encryption at L2/L3 layers redundant? If a pair of endpoints are using TLS protocol for secure data exchanges, does it make the encryption at the network or MAC layers redundant? E.g. if I create a TLS session between two endpoints using bluetooth as transport, then can I turn off encryption at bluetooth level and still get the same level of data communication security?
