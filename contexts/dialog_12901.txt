DAWN: You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
BILL: Well, for the baby, really.
DAWN: Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
GRANDFATHER GEORGE: You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
BILL: I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
GRANDFATHER GEORGE: Only till they get you into the local school.
BILL: With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
GRANDFATHER GEORGE: You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
