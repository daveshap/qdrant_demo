MILO: Lisa.
LISA: You know my name.
MILO: You know mine.
LISA: You're famous around here.
MILO: I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
LISA: I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
MILO: ...Were you?
LISA: We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
MILO: Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
LISA: ...Something like that. Yeah.
MILO: Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
MILO: Did I say something?
LISA: No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
