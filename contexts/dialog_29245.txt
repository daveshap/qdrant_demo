HARRY: A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
PAT: That's nice.
HARRY: Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor.
HARRY: How many people do you all feed?
PAT: Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
HARRY: Good God Almighty, bless your bones. But the problem grows.
PAT: Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
HARRY: Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't. You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
