NORMA: I don't know why you should be so upset. Stop that playing, Max. It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
GILLIS: Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script. There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
NORMA: You'll like it here.
GILLIS: Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
NORMA: You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
GILLIS: I'll take care of that.
NORMA: It's all taken care of. It's all paid for.
GILLIS: I'm used to paying my own bills.
NORMA: You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
GILLIS: Okay. We'll deduct it from my salary.
NORMA: Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters. We won't keep books. Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
GILLIS: Unpack nothing. I didn't say I was staying.
NORMA: Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
