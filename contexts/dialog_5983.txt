MR. ROSE: I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
HOMER: You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
MR. ROSE: Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
HOMER: You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
MR. ROSE: Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
HOMER: Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
