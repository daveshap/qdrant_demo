Do I lose my email account if I drop out of graduate school?
I drooped out of graduate school one year before finishing, in summer. Now, it is the start of fall semester. 

I just received a notification that says "you've been signed out of your account."  For fact, I know that alumni keep their email account forever. How about students who did not complete the degree?
