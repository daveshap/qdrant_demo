Will Democrats swing the election to Trump?
If Hillary is nominated, will the Sanders supporters vote for Trump or will they just stay home rather than vote for Hillary? For the party leadership this may be an invisible issue as none can imagine their base switching to Trump.

Trump is expected to select Kasich as VP. [Kasich is widely expected to be selected by any nominee](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/opinion/sunday/and-the-2016-nominees-may-be.html?_r=0). ["The last candidate to win the White House without Ohio was Democrat John F. Kennedy in 1960"](http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/marco-rubio-is-gop-presidential-candidate-democratic-insiders-think-most-likely-to-win-survey-says-1.11123722). John Kasich is *["more popular with Democrats than with Republicans in New Hampshire"](http://www.redstate.com/jaycaruso/2015/10/20/democrats-support-kasich-trump-new-hampshire/).* His strength in New Hampshire was with independents. The current Trump v. Clinton polls may understate how well a Trump Kasich ticket might do.

The Republicans [had more voters](http://www.thedemocraticstrategist.org/) in both Iowa and New Hampshire than did the Democrats." It is not just about Democrats voting for Trump, it may be even more getting Democrats to vote at all. But Democrats could turn out heavily for Hillary.

* [.".."Well, the Senate GOP might just have ensured the Obama coalition turns out in 16," David Plouffe, a former senior adviser to the President, tweeted on Saturday evening.](http://www.thedemocraticstrategist.org/) Will the death of Justice Scalia really turn out the Democrats?

* [Only 22% of democrats believe that Hillary is honest](https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/01/17/democratic-race-pits-experience-against-honesty/)

The question that everyone is asking, the question that no one can yet answer is: Will democrats vote for a democrat candidate widely viewed as dishonest - or for Trump - or will they just not vote at all?
