ALEXANDER: ... It was a great city. The greatest city in the world.
MARA: You liked it there.
ALEXANDER: Oh, very much... ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think. A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
MARA: Learning was important?
ALEXANDER: Oh very. Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time. Night and day.
MARA: Did you have fires at night?
ALEXANDER: Only to keep warm. For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
MARA: It must have been safe.
ALEXANDER: Oh, it was... ... Most of the time.
MARA: It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
ALEXANDER: Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
MARA: Alexander...?
ALEXANDER: Orion's belt...
ALEXANDER: Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
MARA: You know this?
ALEXANDER: Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path. We're on the carriage path.
