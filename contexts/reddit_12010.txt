A birthday that wasn't
My birthday passed a few minutes back. Nobody wished, except mom. Even dad forgot... Now I'm crying. I just worked all day. Downloaded a movie and watched it alone. Now I think I'm about to start crying... But that's not just today. 

For my 9th or 10th birthday, I thought today is my birthday, I'm going to be happy for the whole day and at least today my sister won't abuse me. But she did... I then told myself, when I grow up, I'll be happy. I failed to do something so simple, be happy.
