GEORGE: You must take a little pleasure in it.
ANDY: Of course! But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support! I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
GEORGE: Andy, you're surrounded by what you create. You are the KING of negative energy.
ANDY: Y-yeah? Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
GEORGE: So how can I help you...?
ANDY: I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. The best show anybody's ever seen!
GEORGE: Do you wanna tour the clubs?
ANDY: No clubs. I wanna reach the TOP! Carnegie Hall...!
