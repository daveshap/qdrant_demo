LUCILLA: You cannot die.
NARCISSUS: Would that Marcus had lived.
LUCILLA: Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
NARCISSUS: He killed his father and then my family...
LUCILLA: Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive. All of them.
NARCISSUS: Where are they?
LUCILLA: Hidden. Where my brother cannot place hands on them. He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all. The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
COMMODUS: Where have you been?
LUCILLA: Taking my pleasure. Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
COMMODUS: You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
LUCILLA: Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother. The people have bread and the city is quiet.
COMMODUS: What is that... wailing?
LUCILLA: The fans of Narcissus. They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
COMMODUS: Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena. The Gods know, I'm tired. Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
LUCILLA: What are you talking about?
COMMODUS: Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
LUCILLA: If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
COMMODUS: But I get what I want, always, don't I?
