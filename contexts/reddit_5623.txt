I got laid off from my job April 1st, I accepted a new job that pays way less out of desperation, and lo and behold my unemployment gets approved 3 days after I start the new job, which pays double what I’ll make at the current job. What are my options?
I’m pretty annoyed.

I didn’t think unemployment was going to happen because it was taking so long and I was having trouble with the website (Florida). 

So I accepted a job at a warehouse who was doing a massive hire(some of their employees were working with covid-19, so half the employees are on leave of absence) which means the job may not even last more than a few months once their regular workers return. I completed my first week of the job yesterday and it’s truly a shitty environment, disorganized, low pay etc. I checked my bank account today and my unemployment benefit went in (more than double what I’ll get paid from this job I just accepted)

Is it possible I can quit and still receive the benefits? Or are you pretty much ineligible the second you accept a new job?

I’d much rather use the time to find a job I could be at long term while collecting the higher unemployment rate because working this job is going to exhaust my savings account as it isn’t enough to pay my bills.


Can anyone give me any guidance?
