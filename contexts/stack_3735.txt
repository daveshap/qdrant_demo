Jonckheere-Terpstra test: two-sided and one-sided, directed and undirected hypotheses I need to perform a Jonckheere-Terpstra test, but I am not sure how to do it and how to interpret the results.I have following data:Three groups doctors1, doctors2, doctors3And how often they ask their patients about their emotional state (0 never - 4 always).I predict such order doctors1 &lt; doctors2 &lt; doctors3In SPSS I chose the non-parametric tests JT and than-\"from smallest to largest\" (groups 1-2-3) and pairwise comparison. My results are p value 0.077 (two-sided)My questions are: I dont really understand what exactly \"from smallest to largest\" means. Does it mean just 1-2-3 order of the groups or is it my hypothesis, that the first group has the smallest value? Second question is - should I divide p value by two? I have a directional hypothesis... if i do it, than i would get statistical sign results. I am really confused.
