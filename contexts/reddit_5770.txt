Embarrassing question: How to start applying to jobs/creating a resume with no degree, basically no work experience and being unemployed for almost a decade?
So obviously this is embarrassing hence the throwaway. Just for a little context, in summary, I've lived at home my whole life, partially because I went through some personal issues and stuff that I'd rather not get into here (extremely luckily for me my parents are way too nice and still let me stay with them) and my last job was pizza delivery almost 10 years ago.

I'm currently going to school (community college trying to transfer to a 4-year), but I desperately need a job so I can get out of my parent's house. I'm just at a loss where to start, or how to present myself in applications, since I have no degree, essentially no work experience and have been unemployed for an unheard of amount of time -- unfortunately obviously I am quite possibly the least hire-able person ever. I don't even know what I could put on a resume. Any suggestions or tips are welcome. Thanks in advance to anyone who replies.
