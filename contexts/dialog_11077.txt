MICHAEL: Where's my brother?
HAGEN: Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami. Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
MICHAEL: I asked about Fredo?
HAGEN: The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam. The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
MICHAEL: I want you to reach Fredo. I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him. Assure him that there will be no reprisals. Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
HAGEN: My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping. Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
MICHAEL: They can come in now.
HAGEN: Wait... there's something else.
MICHAEL: Alright.
MICHAEL: Go on, tell me.
HAGEN: Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
MICHAEL: Was it a boy or a girl?
HAGEN: Mike, at three and a half...
MICHAEL: What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
HAGEN: It was a boy.
MICHAEL: And Kay...she's all right?
HAGEN: She took the Senate Investigation worse.
MICHAEL: Does she blame it on me? The baby?
HAGEN: I don't know.
