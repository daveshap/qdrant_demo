JEFF: Jefferies.
DOYLE: This is Doyle, Jeff.
JEFF: Tom, I've got something real big for you.
DOYLE: Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
JEFF: Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
DOYLE: Your Lisa?
JEFF: My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
DOYLE: I told you that --
JEFF: I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
DOYLE: Like what?
JEFF: Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
DOYLE: A possibility.
JEFF: A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
DOYLE: Like an old hambone?
JEFF: I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
DOYLE: You think perhaps it was old hambone?""
JEFF: In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
DOYLE: Where'd they take Lisa?
JEFF: Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
DOYLE: Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
JEFF: Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
DOYLE: If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
