I've all but given up on this life
UPDATE: Thank you all do much, we had a conversation tonight and we agreed to separate. It was a wonderful to years, but she needs to heal properly before we can go on. I'm also going to get help. I feel better tonight than I did this morning and I think that's important.



I'm only 19. I understand that if I get through this there will be so much life to be had, but things are starting to look bleak. My best friend/girlfriend is dying. She has Ehlos Danlers Syndrome, arrhythmia, and those are both being made worse by the fact that she's developed anorexia nervosa. She's withering away and it's killing me. I haven't gotten out of bed for anything other than work for a half a week. I've been severely depressed my entire life, but this is the first time that I've wanted to kill myself. Not that I want to not exist, but I fully want to kill myself. I need help.
