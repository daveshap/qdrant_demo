HAWKEYE: Very well, Your Majesty. Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
TRAPPER: No, no, that one.
HAWKEYE: Oh, you want to play it straight? I guess I owe you an apology.
FRANK: Godless buffoons, all of them.
HOT LIPS: It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
FRANK: Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you. They ought to be grateful to have you. I certainly am.
HOT LIPS: And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
