GILLIS: Betty, there's no use running out on it. Let's face it, what- ever it is.
BETTY: It's nothing. I got a telegram from Artie.
GILLIS: From Artie. What's wrong?
BETTY: He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there. It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
GILLIS: Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
GILLIS: Stop crying. You're getting married. That's what you've always wanted.
BETTY: I don't want it now.
GILLIS: Why not? Don't you love Artie?
BETTY: Of course I love him. I always will. I'm just not in love with him any more.
GILLIS: What happened?
BETTY: You did.
