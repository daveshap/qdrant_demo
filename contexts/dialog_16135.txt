ALYSSA: I've seen lots of people. It's not a big thing for me.
SAM: Hand me a towel. I'm getting out.
ALYSSA: I'm coming in.
SAM: I don't want you to!
ALYSSA: We're not gonna do anything.
SAM: Why are you so stupid?
ALYSSA: Why are you so uptight?
SAM: I don't even...what do you mean? I don't even know what that means.
ALYSSA: It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
SAM: Hand me a towel. Hand me a towel.
ROBIN: I thought you'd be up with the sun.
GEORGE: My stupid back.
ROBIN: Do you need anything? I'll go to the pharmacy. I have some Demerol at home.
GEORGE: No, I'm...thanks. I took something.
ROBIN: Where's Sam?
GEORGE: He won't use my shower. I don't get it.
GEORGE: You brought your kids?
ROBIN: I kind of said that maybe they could do something. Help. I'm sorry. They really wanted to come. I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me. I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
GEORGE: I'll find something that won't kill them.
ROBIN: Or wound. Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
GEORGE: You're a good mother.
ROBIN: Do you need help?
GEORGE: I think so.
ROBIN: I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep. Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
ADAM: Sam!
