WADE: Please don't cry. Please, honey.
JILL: What are you sorry for?
WADE: I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
JILL: I want to go home.
WADE: You can't.
JILL: That's illegal, you know.
WADE: I know.
JILL: You're a policeman.
WADE: Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
JILL: Oh.
WADE: Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
NICK: It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
WADE: Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
JILL: I want to go home.
WADE: Okay, let's go home, then.
NICK: Wade, I got a message for you. Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
WADE: His office. You mean my old office.
NICK: Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
WADE: He got his deer yet?
NICK: No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
WADE: Going somewhere, Margie?
MARGIE: I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
WADE: Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
MARGIE: Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
