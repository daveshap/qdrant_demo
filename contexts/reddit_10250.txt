i kind of want to fail a suicide attempt just to show people that im struggling
i know this is fucked up, but i feel like no one cares about me, no matter what i do or say. no one ever worries about me, no one ever notices my cries for help. i just feel like the only way to make them notice how shitty im actually doing is by doing something drastic like this. but then again, would anyone even care?
