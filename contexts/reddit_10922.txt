I write this on my way to the top of a building.
As I look out over the cityscape. I feel like I should apologize. Smoking a cigarette, listening to music, I feel free here. This sight is wonderful. 


To my best friend; I'm going to miss you. I'm so sorry about this. I love you immensely and always stay true to who you are because I want you to live for you. I know you get caught up in other people sometimes, and that's fine. Be yourself always. 


To my other very close and best friends, I love you all too, and the amount of stuff you have all supported me through has been immense. Thank you for being there. 


To my mum: I love you mum, I couldn't have asked for a stronger, or better role model. Please forgive me. 


To my dad: please finish the project car, for both of us. I know you might not want to after I'm gone but I want you to do it for us. 


To my brother, make sure your daughter grows up safe. I care about her. I care about you, please stay strong. 


To my other family: thank you all. 


To the people that contributed to this: fuck you. I'll never escape the torment that you put me through. The pain, the uncertainty, making me feel like I'm no longer me. Fuck you for making me feel this way. Fuck you.
