Is it legally possible to ban international graduate students from learning STEM subjects?
Senator Tom Cotton recently suggested in a tweet that Chinese students should not be allowed to study STEM in the United States.

A [Bloomberg Report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-26/gop-senator-says-don-t-let-chinese-students-study-stem-in-u-s) quoted: “The students should be allowed ‘to come here and study Shakespeare and the Federalist Papers, that’s what they need to learn from America,’ he said. ‘They don’t need to learn quantum computing and artificial intelligence from America.’ Previous travel bans include [executive order 13780](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/09/2017-04837/protecting-the-nation-from-foreign-terrorist-entry-into-the-united-states), also known as the “Trump Travel Ban”. 

 My question is: does the law allow the aforesaid intended actions to be actually taken place?
