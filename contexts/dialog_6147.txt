VERONICA: And... he told you all of this?
RANDAL: Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
VERONICA: I... I don't know what to say.
RANDAL: Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante. I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
VERONICA: I'm not sad.
RANDAL: You're not?
VERONICA: No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it! He has his friend do it for him!
RANDAL: He didn't ask me to...
VERONICA: After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
RANDAL: Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
VERONICA: I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
