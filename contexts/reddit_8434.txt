Why did so many Senators, including higher-profile Democrats running for President, vote "Not Voting" on overriding the veto on Saudi Arabian weapon sales?
Today, the Senate voted and failed to override President Trump's veto on a bill blocking sales of weapons to Saudi Arabia through his declaration of a national emergency. [Here is how the vote tallies landed.](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&session=1&vote=00231) While I understand the bill to override had little chance of passing, I'm confused as to the large number of Senators choosing not to vote. Were they simply not in chambers today or is there more of a strategic reason to not vote on this bill? As someone greatly interested in the Democratic primary while also being interested in the inner workings of Congress, it seems odd that so many higher profile Democrats, like Warren, Sanders, and Harris, for example, would sit out this vote. Any insight and opinion on this would be greatly appreciated!
