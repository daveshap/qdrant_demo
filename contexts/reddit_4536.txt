I finally told someone. And now I just feel worse.
Yesterday night I was texting a friend (i had a few drinks) and ended up telling him about my dark thoughts. I don’t even know him that well, but at the time it was so easy. 

He was real kind and nice about it, and reassured me it was good to talk. But waking up today I just felt worse. I haven’t gotten out of bed and we’re well into the afternoon. 

I texted today, but no response. Maybe it was all a mistake. Maybe I shouldn’t burden people with my problems. I’ve always kept em to myself, why not now?
