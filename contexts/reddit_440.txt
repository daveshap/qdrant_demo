I used to be the best
So, i need help coping with the fact that i used to be the best in my choir- compliments every other second. Now my very close friend is the loudest and has the best voice and i realize how bad i actually am. We had a contest today between like 5 people to see who could be the loudest and thats what she was. I didnt compete because i was scared i would do bad but she was still the best. Now i suffer from sever depression and bipolar disorder and on top of the there are a lot of crazy things going on in my life right now so this is very important to me because choir is the only thing that keeps me from taking my own life (dont tell anyone thatðŸ˜‚) and now i find out im actually shit at it. Help? How do i stay alive like deadass no ha ha edgy teen shit im on the verge right now.               

If this isnt the right comunity please let me know!! Thanks
