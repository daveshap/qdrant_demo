I hit on guys in real life now
Ive [27F] been frustrated with online dating for a pretty long time and made a promise to myself to ask out at least one guy on a date this year.

 Yesterday i had my first IRL non tinder date from a guy i picked up at a cafe. We had a blast and just chilled in a park making out. it ended up being a great confidence booster and made me excited to try it again. He said i was really forward and that it was refreshing. 

Basically ill just walk by them,make eye contact, and if they seem to stare back ill smile and say something like, "hey youre a total babe, did you know that?" 

Theyll usually laugh, say thank you or tell me they think im a babe too and then ill ask for their number.

I think we as women are pretty scared of rejection and are quite used to waiting for guys to make the first move. But i want you guys to know that theres something freeing about being open with your emotions
 Asking out men or flirting makes me feel in control and sexy. It doesnt have to be awkward or silly, although it helps if youre quite extroverted.

So heres a question:

Guys: how do you feel if a woman asks you out? Are you creeped out? Do you ever expect it? Does it make you feel emasculated (as silly as that sounds) also, if i use that line, does it sound like i just want to fuck? 

Ladies: would you ever do this? Was it worth it? Do you still do.it?
