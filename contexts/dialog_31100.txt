LULA: I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
MARIETTA: You ain't takin' Pace, though.
LULA: Course I am, mama.
MARIETTA: What time's Sailor's train get in?
LULA: Six.
MARIETTA: Got any plans?
LULA: Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
MARIETTA: Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
LULA: Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
MARIETTA: Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
LULA: Really, mama, I gotta go.
MARIETTA: What if I asked you not to?
LULA: Wouldn't make any difference.
MARIETTA: What if I told you not to?
LULA: Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.
