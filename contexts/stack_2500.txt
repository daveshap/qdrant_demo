storage in dams on a river system above specific points I want to find the storage in dams snapped to a set of polylines defining rivers above specific points on each river.Using ArcMap 10.3 I have the polylines representing rivers, the points denoting dams, snapped to the river polylines, with a storage variable, and the points on the rivers where I want to calculate the cumulative upstream dam storage.How to proceed?
