bye
i’ve been diagnosed with persistent depression. i’m going to overdose on anti depressants, pain killers, and slit my wrists. a few months ago my parents sent me to the mental health center, but instead of comfort they were frustrated and pissed at me for being depressed. i have anxiety that never goes away. i’m spending my last day watching marvel movies and sleeping. i’m not going to write a note. probably leave the house around three am and do it by a bridge. i feel at peace thinking about it. the only thing i’m worried about is going to hell. i’m a christian and i don’t want to burn. i want to see God, but i also don’t want to be alive. tonight i’m going to die. thank you
