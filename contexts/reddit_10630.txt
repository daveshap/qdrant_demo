I'm gonna end it all
Everything is getting worse and worse. My parents value material things more than me and I was almost going to get beaten up today by them. At school everyone is against me and some make the experience a nightmare. I will just run away tomorrow, find a nice tree to hang myself and end it all. The only "friend" I have doesn't give a shit, he only wished me good luck when I told him I wanna run away. I'm gonna make everyone happy tomorrow.
