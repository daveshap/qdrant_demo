Are there any jobs that train and pay you?
I’m looking out there for any IT, Data, Programming, Technology, Engineer jobs(mainly in Florida) that train you? Without having a degree? (Stupid question, I know. But I’m curious) 
I’m planning on going to college of course, but I’d like to know if anything like that is possible. 
Also, off topic but which is best? College or Trade school?
