Quorom Configuration for 3 Node Windows cluster We have 2 node onsite and the 3rd node on DR  and there is no disk witness. Due to maintenance I set the DR site to be primary and the other 2 nodes to be manual in asynchronous mode  and after both the 2 node went down together and the whole cluster went down due to quorum could not achieve disk majority. The Dynamic quorum failed I believe since both the on site 2 nodes went simultaneously. Since this is a 3 node cluster so the node majority quorum will be used, my question is: if I face similar scenario when the on site 2 node will go down together in that case how can I keep the cluster operational on one node / DR site..
