TAYLOR: --a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
HUBERT: Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
MCGANN: He's batty!
HUBERT: Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
TAYLOR: What!
HUBERT: Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
MCGANN: Oh--oh.
HUBERT: He's the hero of fifty thousand boys and a hundred thousand parents. Look at these congratulations pouring in! I tell you, gentlemen, by this one statesman-like act, I have--
TAYLOR: But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
HUBERT: Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
TAYLOR: *But you never asked me*!
HUBERT: Oh--Jim!
PAINE: Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
TAYLOR: Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
PAINE: A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
TAYLOR: Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
