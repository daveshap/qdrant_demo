BRIAN: Okay.
JENNIFER: Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
BRIAN: No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
JENNIFER: Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
BRIAN: Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
JENNIFER: But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
BRIAN: In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
