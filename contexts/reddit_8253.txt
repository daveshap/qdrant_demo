What, if any, are the disputed questions of fact between the Majority and Minority impeachment reports?
Yesterday afternoon, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released its 300 page report on President Trump's conduct in respect to Ukraine as part of the [impeachment inquiry authorized by the House of Representatives.](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/660)

The day before, Republicans on the committee released their own report on the same subject.

Do the dueling reports contain material differences on questions of fact?  Or are they just different views on the same basic underlying facts?  Does either report contain major factual inaccuracies?
