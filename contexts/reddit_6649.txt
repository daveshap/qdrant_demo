How would I ask a recruiter to find me a different position?
A recruiting company helped me get a job as a contractor for a position back in September. The original contract was until January, then it was extended to April and now it’s been extended to August. When the pandemic started the company I am working for ended up letting go of 90% of the contractors and only kept a handful of us.

The pay is good, the people I work with are great, but it’s not really what I want to be doing and the management is horrible. I’m extremely thankful that I’ve been able to work, especially through the pandemic, but I am at the end of my rope with this company I am working for. If there was anything comparable, I would much rather be working elsewhere.

My question is, how would I bring this up to my recruiter without burning any bridges? Do I even bring it up under the current situation? I know I’m lucky to have a job in the first place, but honestly I’m so frustrated with my workplace that if there was an opportunity elsewhere, I want to take it.

My contract can be terminated at any time, by either party.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.
