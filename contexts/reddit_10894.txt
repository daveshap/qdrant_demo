"Committing suicide would be selfish, because it's making your loved ones live in pain for the rest of their lives just so you won't have to suffer." Uh, so then aren't you pretty selfish for forcing ME to live in pain for my entire life just so YOU won't have to suffer?
sorry for title gore - I'm getting so sick of my being suicidal automatically being attacked with accusations of being selfish, because of how much it will affect the people around me if I did it - which, by the way, is pretty much the only fucking reason I'm still here. I've been suffering for a long time, the only reason I'm putting up with it and haven't just killed myself already is basically for my family. So they won't have to find my body, so I won't leave the couple of friends I have alone, so no one else will have to suffer like I'm being forced to. But no, yeah, I'M the selfish one.

I don't WANT to live anymore. You're the fucking selfish one for forcing me to just for your own fucking happiness when I've been telling you for years that I am not. Happy. It hurts. It really hurts. If you truly loved me, you would let me end it.
