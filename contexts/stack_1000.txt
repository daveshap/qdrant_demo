I have somehow locked or removed my access to sudo - how can I fix it? I am fairly new at Ubuntu system and commands. I was trying to follow some tutorial online explaining how to setup using no password to download apps. I was in visudo, and next thing I know I can't use the sudo command, nor download any software/apps. I don't know where to start looking. If anyone could point me in the right direction, that would be an awesome way to start my weekend.
