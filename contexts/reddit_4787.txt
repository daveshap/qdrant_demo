Immediate downward spiral
I've really hit a low spot lately. It feels like everything is going wrong at the same time on purpose. 

I lost my job because of covid and as a result, my apartment. l've moved in with my brother, but it feels like I'm nothing but a burden because I can't find a job and have no money

I have less than 100$ to my name

My car, which in some places, is literally held together with tape, continues to fall apart faster than I can fix it.

I've struggled with depression and extreme self hatred for as long as I can remember. When I was a teenager I started self medicating with weed to help me deal with things like my depression and anxiety, which helps a lot actually. But because I have no money, I can't afford to anymore. 

Things were going fine until covid hit, and then life immediately failed. Like everything shut down all at once. I don't know where to go, I don't know what to do, other than slog through the listings on my brother's computer, trying to find a job.
