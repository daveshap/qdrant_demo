MOTHER: She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
DADDY: Um-hmm. Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
DADDY: See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
BUDDY: Well, it's not very plain.
DADDY: That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
BUDDY: But how would you find him?
DADDY: Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
BUDDY: Well, I don't know. No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
DADDY: True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with.
DADDY: See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
BUDDY: Well... maybe...
DADDY: And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!
