If you’re on a dating app, and you leave your bio blank, you’re automatically getting swiped left
You’re basically asking people to base their opinion solely on your looks. I mean I know thats what Online dating is, to an extent. Don’t you have hobbies? Don’t you wanna tell people what you’re looking for? Don’t you want people to know at least SOMETHING about you???
