The absence of a stamp on entry on a Schengen visa of the type d I have French Schengen visa (type D, study in France for 5 months) and Finnish Schengen visa (type C) and Russian citizenship. I took a coach from Russia to Finland and flight from Finland to France. I informed passport control that I am going to study in France, but they stamped Schengen type C anyway. On the national French Schengen there is no stamp about entry, it turns out that by the end of my studies I \"will stay\" in type C for more than 90 days. Is it okay, and what do I do with my documents? Or who/where should I go/call/write to for official information about it (OFII, Embassy or anything)?
