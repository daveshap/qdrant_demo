How do I cure my social awkwardness?
So ever since I was little, I got bullied and was pretty isolated from others. I was able to make a few friends, but it was only in school. My parents never let me go over to any friends house, hang out after school, or really talk to anyone (outside of school via things like texting n social media). 

Even now when I have access to social media n stuff, I can never get myself to even say hi to anyone. In situations when I'm around new people or not really close with anyone around me, I tend to just be on my own out of habit. The few times I've been able to muster up some courage, I can never carry on a conversation or say anything that would want them to talk with me more or be my friend. 

Even if there is people I really want to talk to and have good conversations with them, I freeze up and assume the worse case scenario, and I dont want them to think of me as a weirdo and I simply dont do anything. 

Anyone know how to help?
