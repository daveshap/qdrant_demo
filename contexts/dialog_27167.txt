CUTHBERT: Sweet Jesus!
D'AGOSTA: Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan. Move.
CUTHBERT: My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone! We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
D'AGOSTA: I have to help Pendergast. Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me. The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
