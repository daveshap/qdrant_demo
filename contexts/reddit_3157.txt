What is a job that best meets these three parameters (if such a job exists): low-stress, well-paying, and in demand?
I know these parameters may seem impossible to meet, but I like to think my threshold for each is fairly low.

**Low-stress**: No crazy hours (late night, tons of overtime). No taking work home. Not super fast-paced. Not hard on the body/labor-intensive.

**Well-paying**: At least 50-60K a year.

**In demand**: Not impossible to find a job and, given enough time, should reasonably expect to be able to find a job at some point.

A bit more about my situation. I'm about to finish a student teaching practicum, and unfortunately I'm starting to see what teachers and former teachers mean when they rave against the terrible work/life balance of the job.

I love the actual act of teaching: being in the classroom with students, getting to know them, discussing interesting topics. They can be a bit unruly at times, but so was I in high school so I find it endearing even as I struggle to keep them orderly. But all the grading, lesson planning, contact with parents is just too much and the work day is never really over even after the last bell rings. I know I'll be burnt out by everything *around* teaching if I continue with it.

Long story short, I'm providing this background for a **fourth parameter: ideally this job won't send me back to school for a terribly long time.** I already have a Bachelor's, though it is in the humanities. An Associate's would be ideal, but wouldn't be opposed to something requiring a Bachelor's or Master's if I can more easily make the jump because of the credits I have from my Bachelor's, though I'm not sure how that works.

Essentially, I'm done chasing a dream job, which I thought teaching would be for me. I just want something that meets those three parameters above, and ideally the fourth parameter too because I've already been in school for a while, racked up debt, and just want to enter the working world ASAP so I can start making money.

Sucks that I kind of have to start over on my career like this, but I figure it's best to be honest with myself now than hate my life later because I've locked myself into a miserable occupation. If nothing else, I've at least gained a new understanding of myself and what I want in life. Sometimes you can't figure that out without some trial and error.

TL;DR: See title. Also, 4th parameter would be "job that doesn't send me back to school for a long time." I already have a Bachelor's in the humanities.
