led I can stick on a AA battery I have a toy for my son, it's great but it flies round and round in the dark,  I was thinking of sticking an LED on it like we used to do at school - back then LED's were rubbish but they had long legs and were designed for electronics and soldering - I am 43 now - but I remember we had to calculate the resistance put in a resistor and then it wouldn't blow the LED .. we made a fuse tester back then..since then LED's have changed markedly.. but is there still a \"brand/family\" of LED .. a single stand LED... that will plug straight into a 1.5v AA without blowing that comes with REALLY long wire legs so I can solder it direct to the terminals of the AA battery in series, and fit it into the battery enclosure simply by putting the battery cover on top of it? and do they still come with thin stiff wire long metal legs that can be bent, hold a shape and remain put?OR. If I need a resister in series what is the resistor I need can someone help me calculate?and also, they are still a diode, are they forgiving of the polarity or will they blow if placed the wrong way round?
