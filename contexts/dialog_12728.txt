LIBRARIAN: Good way to lose your job.
BRENNA: Some job. Card filing and cabinet dusting. Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
LIBRARIAN: I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
BRENNA: It's bullshit. Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
LIBRARIAN: You always were hard to impress.
BRENNA: Who is it?
LIBRARIAN: Not who. What. Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
