To email again or not...
Hey so I interviewed for a job. A recruiter reached out to me last Wednesday. Went through 2 rounds with a recruit manager, the account manager and was expecting to have another. The account manager whose in charge of placing people in the job at the certain company told me “you will totally get this job, just tell them the same exact things you did at your internship and you’ll be golden, they’re looking for people like you”. 

There are ~40 positions being filled due to high volume of business right now. I was told by the recruit manager last Thursday that she should know more by the beginning of next week and a schedule for last round of interviews (this week). I emailed her Tuesday mid morning asking for an update on where things stand. She replied  “the hiring team is reviewing all resumes and applications today and tomorrow. I will let you know when I hear back from them and whats next!” It’s now Thursday mid morning and I’ve been so anxious because I’m excited for this job... but I also feel like it’s taking longer than they originally told me to schedule a final interview..? The recruit manager seems honest about letting me know either way... but when do I contact her again? Or do I even follow up? I don’t want to be annoying but I’m anxiously waiting to see if I get this job (recent college grad here!) it’s a really great door to a company I’d love to work for... I just don’t know if somehow it’s taking longer than usual because it’s filling so many spots at once?
