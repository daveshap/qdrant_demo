>Officials at ACT, which makes the exam, said on Tuesday that starting next September, students would be able to retake specific sections rather than the entire test, which lasts about three hours.

> The change would allow students to avoid getting a worse grade on a section they had scored well on earlier. Although a growing number of colleges and universities have made test scores an optional part of college applications, many high schoolers feel pressure to score highly on the ACT and SAT exams.

No reason to take the SAT anymore.
