How do I learn when to apply which statistical distributions? I am learning Bayesian modeling and having trouble keeping straight when it is most appropriate to apply the various statistical distributions beyond the basic ones like the beta, binomial, and Gaussian. Are there resources out there that provide overviews of the practical applications of various distributions, in particular less commonly used ones? I am aware of the 2011 by Catherine Forbes et al., which does a great job of presenting the mathematical properties of the various statistical distribution, but I want something that helps me with application. I would appreciate any references to books, articles, or websites.
