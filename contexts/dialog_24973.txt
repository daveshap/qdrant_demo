BETH: I'm not sure. I've never seen anything like it.
BARNES: You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you? Can't you tell us something.
BETH: ... He lied to us. He left us down here.
NORMAN: C'mon, Beth. Don't make this personal. He told me himself they were taking us back.
BETH: Yeah, he <u>told</u> you. Think. What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose? He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman. They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
NORMAN: So what?
BETH: So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute? Nobody.
NORMAN: You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
BETH: Fuck you, Norman! It's right here...
BETH: Although advised of risks
NORMAN: Where did you get this?
BETH: In Edmunds' things.
NORMAN: You went through Edmunds' things?
BETH: He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
NORMAN: Calm down, Beth. Alright?
BETH: Don't tell me to calm down!
NORMAN: It's done, alright? It's over! And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
BETH: You said something to him, didn't you?
NORMAN: What?
BETH: You told him about me?
NORMAN: Beth --
BETH: You did, didn't you?
NORMAN: Don't do this.
BETH: You bastard.
NORMAN: Beth, I didn't. Hold it together. Alright?
BETH: Yeah, okay. Sure, Norman.
NORMAN: Beth --
BETH: No, I should stay calm. Like you say. Right, Norman? Stay calm.
