QUEEN: General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry... Who's the cutest widdle worker? You are! Yes, you! Don't forget to brush your teeth! Ship 'er out. What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
FORMICA: We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
QUEEN: Yes, what else?
FORMICA: Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me. As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures. I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
QUEEN: No snacking between meals! Off you go! Now -- what were we saying?
FORMICA: I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
QUEEN: Yes, General Formica. Carry on, my good man! I don't know what we would do without you.
