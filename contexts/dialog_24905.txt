SHEILA: Don't go near the bowling alley.
KASTLE: Bowling Center"!"
SHEILA: It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
THEO: Nope, I couldn't care less.
SHEILA: I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
THEO: Why should I help that old fuck.
SHEILA: Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
THEO: Zip.
SHEILA: And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
THEO: Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history. Too late for what?
SHEILA: Nothing.
THEO: Too late for what, Sheila?
SHEILA: You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
THEO: You got any broken bones?
SHEILA: No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
THEO: Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
SHEILA: I can't tell you, Theo.
THEO: Why not?
SHEILA: I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
THEO: Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
SHEILA: I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
THEO: It's Junior, isn't it.
SHEILA: I can't - I can't do it. He's my brother.
THEO: He's my father.
SHEILA: These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
SHEILA: You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron, or anywhere else.
THEO: I'll be at the bridge.
THEO: Knock-knock.
JUNIOR: Who's there?
JUNIOR: Who's there!
THEO: Buzz Fazeli.
JUNIOR: NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right. Knock-knock.
THEO: Who's there?
