Is it possible to avoid a dangerous collision with the ground after free fall by converting the potential energy into rotational kinetic energy? Is a human body able to survive if someone sabotages your parachute and you're in a free fall towards earth suddenly realizing that you have one out of two options left- either die or stand on the ground and directly converting all the potential energy into kinetic energy in form of a front roll? Would that be possible? Maybe we need to consider the type of ground too (muddy, soft ground, rocky ground,...).
