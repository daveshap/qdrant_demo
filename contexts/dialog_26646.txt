RITA: Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes? I called you twice.
SIDNEY: I've been up to here. Listen, honey, tell me something. You know Susan Hunsecker...? Has she been in? I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
RITA: I don't think so.
SIDNEY: You're sure. Find out for me.
RITA: Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
SIDNEY: Is Frank D'Angelo around?
RITA: At the bar - Sidney...
D'ANGELO: Joe, give my nephew a drink.
SIDNEY: Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
D'ANGELO: That's a lollipop that, boy. The kid is only great.
SIDNEY: And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
D'ANGELO: Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
SIDNEY: See my mother?
D'ANGELO: I only had a few hours.
D'ANGELO: Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
SIDNEY: Robard's my client. I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
SIDNEY: Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
D'ANGELO: Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
SIDNEY: You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
D'ANGELO: Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge. And, frankly, I'm glad. For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours. I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart. Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
SIDNEY: You told him that?
D'ANGELO: Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
SIDNEY: When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
D'ANGELO: Coupla weeks. For eight weeks.
SIDNEY: That's a nice tour. All booked? When was Susie around here last?
D'ANGELO: Four five nights ago. That's how I know the romance is off. Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
SIDNEY: Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
D'ANGELO: I don't like this threatening attitude. When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
