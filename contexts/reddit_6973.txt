Can I be fired for something I cannot physically improve.
Hi,

Okay so i'm absolutely terrified that i'm going to get fired and so I've come here for some reassurance or advice or something to try and make me less of a panicky mess.   
I work at a dog boarding facility in Ontario Canada and while my actual work with the dogs is excellent the more practical side of things is a poopshow. We have a set time for cleaning out the kennels and I am constantly lagging behind. I have absolutely no idea why. I am going as fast as I can and  at what is an uncomfortable pace for me and yet i'm always finishing about half hour behind everyone else at the very least.   


I got totally chewed out yesterday for it (and honestly thought I was going to burst into tears because I am apparently a strong independent adult)  and now I have to outline why I cannot meet my time goals to the boss. But....I have no idea?  I literally cannot go any faster, I spend 2+ hours out of breath and covered in sweat as I am actually going full pelt (with all the water on the floor and my clumsiness that's caused a fair few injuries including one fairly nasty head injury, the speed isn't exactly helping my asthma either)  


The only explanation I can think of is that I am dyspraxic which often makes people slower than their peers at physical tasks but...that feels like a lame excuse? I have disclosed I have dyspraxia to my boss but it felt like I was making excuses there again.   


Maybe i'm just an idiot or being lazy or something? I seriously don't know.

So can I be fired for being slow?  Can they fire me despite offering no help or solutions to my slowness?  Is having stunted motor neurons a valid reason for being slow and therefore a reason to fire me?  


I'm freaking out I cannot lose this job, i'd be so screwed if I did...my medical bills would probably be lower though. But then again i'd be homeless so..,

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!
