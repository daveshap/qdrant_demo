Employers, how does college education affect your decision to hire someone?
I hear people say college is a waste of money and won’t help with getting a job, then I hear you need a college education or else you won’t get one and I want to know, how does a college education affect your decision to hire someone? If you look for a college education, how do you feel about bachelors, masters, PhD, do those affect your decision too? Do you care if they went to a really prestigious college or a community college? What kind of jobs do you definitely need a college education for and what jobs do you don’t?
