Is it possible to obtain more accurate annual extremes predictions from sub-annual data? I'm looking at various extreme climate variables, such as 50-year or 500-year maximum daily precipitation, using a generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The problem with this is that there are generally not many years of data with which to calculate the distribution of maximum annual values, and so the constraints on the tails of the distribution, where it really matters, are weak.I'm wondering if it's possible to calculate a more constrained distribution by using sub-annual data (e.g. daily data), that can provide better estimates of annual extreme probabilities? I know that there are factors in the daily data that mean that the distributions are not directly comparable. For example there is a seasonal cycle in precipitation at most places. However, these major cyclic trends can be relatively easily accounted for.If I remove those trends (and assuming there are no other hidden daily biases), would it be fair to say that the daily probability of precipitation over 200mm is the same as the annual probability of days with precipitation over 200mm divided by 365?And if I'm calculating the annual likelyhood of maximum daily precip over 500mm, would it be safe to say that it's the equal to $(1 - (1 - p_{daily}(&gt;500mm))^{365})$?Or are annual and daily probabilities not directly comparable in this way? I guess I can always use an MCMC to get annual estimates if not.
