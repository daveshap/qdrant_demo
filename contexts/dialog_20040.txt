PETE: It was a moment a weakness!
EVERETT: Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
PETE: They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
EVERETT: I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
DELMAR: We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
PETE: No, they never did turn me into a toad.
DELMAR: Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
PETE: Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys. Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
DELMAR: Huh?!
PETE: Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
