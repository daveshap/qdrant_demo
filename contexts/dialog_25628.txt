JENNY: You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
STAR MAN: On the radio they say it's good.
JENNY: Hurry up.
STAR MAN: The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
JENNY: No. Get in.
STAR MAN: You can have one.
JENNY: I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
STAR MAN: Are you angry at me?
JENNY: No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
