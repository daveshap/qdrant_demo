OLD MAN: Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
JESSICA: We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
LOGAN: What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
JESSICA: He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
LOGAN: We can't. We're going back.
JESSICA: To what?
LOGAN: I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
JESSICA: You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
LOGAN: Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
JESSICA: Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
LOGAN: Things change!
JESSICA: You want to go back to kill, is that it?! Now, you'll want to kill your own!!! Kill Sandmen!!! Killing's all you ever...!!!
LOGAN: Jessica... listen to me... listen to me... The Lifeclocks made me kill Francis. They make people die or be killed every day. If I didn't try and destroy that... I couldn't live here or anywhere. Do you understand?
JESSICA: I want to be alive and with you, that's all I want.
