BUFF: Hey! Hey.
ERICA: I'm so burnt-out.
BUFF: Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
ERICA: Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
BUFF: Yeah?
ERICA: Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much. Did you get your tape?
BUFF: Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
ERICA: Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
BUFF: I can come visit?
ERICA: You better! Yes!
BUFF: I will.
ERICA: It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
