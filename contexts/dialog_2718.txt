CAPTAIN GROGAN: Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business. The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her. You are but a boy. Best is willing to consider you as such. Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service. Make Best an apology, and be off.
RODERICK: A man of honor dies, but never apologizes. I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
HARRY: There's nothing else for it. Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
CAPTAIN BEST: Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
HARRY: Don't bully, Mr. Best. Here are the pistols. God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
