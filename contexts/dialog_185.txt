OLEG: I'm serious...this - this is a great American film. Full of violence and sex. And I want my credit.
EMIL: Credit?
OLEG: Yes. Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
EMIL: Yes. But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
EMIL: You got that?
OLEG: No, I don't get that!
EMIL: You think you are a director? You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit. And I hate you. I fucking hate you.
