KIRK: What about Spock?
SAREK: I am not sure. Only time will answer. Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
KIRK: What I have done, I had to do.
SAREK: But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
KIRK: If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
SPOCK: I know you... Do I not?
KIRK: Yes. And I know you.
SPOCK: My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
KIRK: You would have done the same for me.
SPOCK: Why would you do this...?
KIRK: Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
