It took a pandemic
Well last month we were facing eviction and having an impossible time finding an affordable apartment. Then COVID shut down happened and everyone left my town. Broke leases and moved back home when school canceled. Then apartments got cheaper and I got a bigger apartment than I currently have in an affordable price range! We used our tax return to pay off our previous eviction. The Governor canceled all evictions so we are able to finish our lease and we can pay off the money we owe in back rent instead. The apartment isn't going to file anymore. Now we wont have any negative marks on our credit. We still have money to get a (new to me) bigger couch too a benefit of school closing is students dont move with their stuff. I feel like I can breathe for the first time since I left my job for a comission based travel company (covid said no to this venture at least for now)
