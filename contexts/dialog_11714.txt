ANNIE: It's me.
ROBERT: Hi.
ANNIE: Hi.
ROBERT: So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
ANNIE: I should be in by two.
ROBERT: Okay. You want me to pick you up?
ANNIE: Sure... What's Grace up to?
ROBERT: Riding with Judith.
ANNIE: I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
ROBERT: That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it. What do you want to do about dinner?
ANNIE: I don't know. We'll figure it out.
ROBERT: Okay. We'll see you later then.
ANNIE: Yeah. Bye.
