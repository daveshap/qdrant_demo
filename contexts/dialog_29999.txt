MR. ARKADY: That's a shame, Bobby. A real shame.
BOBBY: And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
MR. ARKADY: Arkady""
BOBBY: Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
MR. ARKADY: ...And let me guess. This robber -- he gets your money.
BOBBY: No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
MR. ARKADY: The old lady?
BOBBY: With a <u>shotgun</u>! She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive. I mean, what are the odds?
BOBBY: Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage. I tell you, Mister... if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know? So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see? The bus depot here has a Western Union thing. And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
MR. ARKADY: Which you don't have.
BOBBY: But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
BOBBY: Yeah, if you could send it care of...
MR. ARKADY: ...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
BOBBY: A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
MR. ARKADY: A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk: I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller. You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>. I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
