DANTE: Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
RANDAL: Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
DANTE: I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
RANDAL: You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
DANTE: What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
RANDAL: Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
DANTE: There aren't.
RANDAL: How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
DANTE: It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
RANDAL: Let's hear it.
DANTE: The milkmaids.
RANDAL: The milkmaids?
DANTE: The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
RANDAL: You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
DANTE: Which ones?
RANDAL: All of them.
