My dad is a fat-shamer
Title says it all. We were eating at a restaurant and an ample couple sat next to us. My dad just gave a look over and didn't say anything. By the way, my dad is a little *cough cough* on the overweight side. When we were leaving he said "Did you see the couple next to us? They're so overweight." I overreacted a little and said "Excuse me? That's so rude of you!" He responded,"Can't I say what I want? This is America (eye roll)" I said back," How would you feel if someone else called you fat and shamed you?" He said "I'd slap them." I responded," Great, why don't I slap you?" My mom was there and said,"Hey, stop it. Control yourself (to me)" I was really pissed (at him) and overstepped my boundaries. I'm often ashamed of my body, so this was like an indirect slap in the face. He is a republican and tbh I nearly 100% disagree with him on basically everything, political or not. I refused to talk to him the rest of the night. God, this really ticks me off. My dad has a lot of problems, but this shouldn't be one of them.
