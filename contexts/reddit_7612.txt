Do you translate in-text citations from a governmental agency in APA format?
I'm translating a document to English and I was wondering if I had to translate the in-text citation of the ministry of education for example. I have a lot of references from the Ministry Of Education, Science, Technology and Innovations and the acronym in Albanian is different from the one in English. 

So in Albanian it's (MAShTI, 2020) while in English it would be (MESTI, 2020).

Thanks in advance for your replies.
