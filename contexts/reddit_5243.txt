Should I take a job that is fully remote?
Hey!

As the title suggest I got offered a job that is 100% remote.

There would be gatherings for industry events a couple times throughout the year but apart from that it is a senior marketing manager position in which the whole company is spreadout over the globe. 

The pay is better than my current one but the job itself includes more responsibilities as for which a non-remote job in my area I would land at least 20-30% more income
The contract is limited to a 12 month period for now. 

What are your experiences with remote work, especially a job that is 100% from home?
