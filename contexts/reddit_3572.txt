Got over my fear and asked her out. Ended terribly
Decided to get over my fear of asking this girl i like out on a date. Just got new job and just graduated school so i have been feeling a little less depressed. When i asked her out she didn't even say anything she just rolled her eyes and walked away like i wasn't even worth her speaking to me. Funny thing is i don't even feel bad about it anymore. Her loss im a jet engine mechanic now and i am starting to redo my relationship with life. So thats good enough for me.
