Is anyone here a Financial Aid Counselor? Or know much about the position?
Currently trying to break into the field after graduating with my master's in counseling and student personnel psych degree this past spring. I'm working at a hospital doing a job that doesn't really have a whole lot to do with my degree unfortunately. I recently had an in-person interview for an advising job but haven't heard back, so I'm guessing I didn't get it. However, a Financial Aid Counselor job just opened up at my undergraduate school so I'm considering applying for that. I'm just worried that job wouldn't lead to other jobs in student affairs, but that might just be because I have a lack of knowledge about that area of student affairs. Thanks!
