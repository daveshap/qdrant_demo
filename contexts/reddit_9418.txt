Finally free from Credit Card Debt!
Title says it all! My wife and I lived on the west coast and I had to leave my job (internship expired). We were running shorter and shorter on cash and were forced to break out our credit card to stay afloat for a while. We used it for rent a few times (big no-no) and for lots of other things. We were both miserable out there so we moved to the midwest in June of 2018. By the time the move was over, we had about 4k racked up on the card. We both found good jobs after our move, and I wanted this debt gone. This morning I made my last payment of 400 dollars and we now have a 0 balance on the card! Now we can actually start putting some money away!
