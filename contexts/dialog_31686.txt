FREDDY: Where did you get this cauliflower?
CARLSON: From your office, sir.
FREDDY: Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
CARLSON: Yes, sir. But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
FREDDY: Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
CARLSON: No, sir. It will never happen again.
FREDDY: Here! This cauliflower is useless to me.
