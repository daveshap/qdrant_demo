GIN: They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
CRUZ: You got a better idea?
GIN: Yeah. Me.
GIN: We've got to catch him in the act.
CRUZ: Why didn't I think of that?
GIN: It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
CRUZ: With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
GIN: I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
CRUZ: How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
GIN: I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
CRUZ: That's doable.
GIN: And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
CRUZ: Which you have in mind.
