PARKER: Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive. Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.

MADISON: You all right?
PARKER: Fine. Never felt better in my life. See, I'm a good liar.
