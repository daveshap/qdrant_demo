TOM: You okay?
JANE: Great.
TOM: Why can't I let go of this woman?
JANE: Well...
JANE: At least kiss me when you do that.
TOM: You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
JANE: This is hysterical.
JANE: I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight. You know why?
TOM: Because you're nuts.
JANE: Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
