ELIZABETH: Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
JACK: What? What was that? Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
ELIZABETH: Nothing ... it's nothing. Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child. A song about pirates.
JACK: I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear it.
ELIZABETH: Oh, no ... it's silly. Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates, really. They seemed so romantic and daring --
ELIZABETH: That was before I met one, of course.
JACK: Now I must hear this song. An authentic pirate song. Have at it.
ELIZABETH: Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
JACK: More to drink!
