I might have to have back surgery
I have an appointment today to tell if I will have surgery or not. My doctor saw a bulging disc, a torn disc and a cyst on my spine. She said there could be more, but is sending me to a specialist to look at the MRI closer. I am scared because I have a 7 month old and I know the surgery can be risky, and what if I will never be able to chase her around or have other kids? I am trying not to think of it that way...but it's hard not to.
