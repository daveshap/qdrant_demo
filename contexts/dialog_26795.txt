EMMI: That's because you had a proper upbringing.
DAVID: That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
EMMI: Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
DAVID: Respect your elders and your betters!
EMMI: And no elbows on the table!
DAVID: Eating is eating... and...
EMMI: And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
DAVID: Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
STEVE: David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
DAVID: Yes.
STEVE: So what is it?
DAVID: The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
STEVE: What's that mean?
DAVID: I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
STEVE: Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
DAVID: Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
STEVE: That's big of him.
STEVE: Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
DAVID: Five minutes.
STEVE: It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
STEVE: Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
RODE: It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
STEVE: Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
RODE: Me? Never. Never.
