KIT: Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
HOLLY: Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
KIT: Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.
KIT: Everybody loves trout.
HOLLY: I'm serious.
