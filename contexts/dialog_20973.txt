O'BRIEN: Somebody has to.
SUSAN: Same old Daniel.
O'BRIEN: Oh no. Not by a long shot. I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
SUSAN: Is that so?
O'BRIEN: Oh yeah. See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off. Oh no. The big house does things to a man.
SUSAN: The big house?
O'BRIEN: The big house.
SUSAN: Jesus, Daniel. It wasn't Ryker's Island. It was work camp for white collar criminals.
O'BRIEN: A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
