How to install Rufus on Ubuntu Mate? I have been to the website &amp; while there is talk of it being compatible there is no actual Linux supported link for it, its all exe's. I am using Ubuntu Mate the latest version 64Bit edition.If someone can provide a direct link or terminal code to make it happen because its not showing up under the software center even with 3rd party enabled.
