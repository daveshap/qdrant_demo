**5:42 PM EST** Welcome to the 2018 /r/NeutralPolitics election night megathread!  I'll be keeping a running tick tock below as the night goes on.  If you know of helpful resources I can add above please share in the comments and I'll try to integrate them. 

**6:01 PM EST** First polls have closed in eastern KY and most of Indiana.  KY-06 is an interesting race to watch, [rated as a toss up](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/kentucky/6/) by forecasters.  

**6:21 PM EST** Posted a new thread because of an issue with the title of the old thread.  Sorry about the error.

**6:33PM EST** First called race of the night is KY-05 for Republican Harold Rogers.  No surprise there as [he was forecast to win by 50.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/kentucky/5/)

**7:00 PM EST**  Big poll closing, GA, SC, VA, VT, NH, and most of FL closed.  Remainders of KY and IN closed.  Networks calling **VT** and **VA** Senate for Democrats.

**7:25 PM EST** Lot of votes coming in now.  Looking decently good for Democrats.  McGrath in KY-06 up by 6 with over 40% reporting.  FL-Sen and FL-Gov looking pretty close to 2012 results for Obama (who won FL).

**7:30 PM EST**  Ohio and West Virginia close, no calls.

**7:38 PM EST** First flip of the night, **VA-10** has flipped to democrats.

**7:55 PM EST** OH-Sen has been called for Sherrod Brown (D).  I am still trying to get a handle on IN-Sen, but it seems like a probable R pickup at the moment. But no votes from Bloomington and minimal from Indianapolis, so no calls yet.

**8:00 PM EST** Big poll closing, calls in MA-Sen, CT-Sen, DE-Sen, MD-Sen, PA-Sen RI-Sen all for democrats.  No calls in TN, NJ, ME.  MA-Gov for Baker (R).

**8:22 PM EST** 538's live model now has Republicans favored to take the House.

**8:46 PM EST** 538 [has now changed their model to be less aggressive.](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1059982719554215936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  Also first toss up call of KY-06 has gone to Barr (R)

**8:47 PM EST** ABC has projected Braun (R) to unseat Joe Donnelly in IN-Sen.

**8:59 PM EST** Manchin (WV-Sen) has held his seat.

**9:00 PM EST** Poll closings in a bunch more states.  No call in TX-Sen, TX gov for Abbot.  NY-Gov for Dems, NY-Sen for Dems, No call in AZ-Sen, ND sen no call, MN-Sen (Klobuchar) elected. WI-Sen Dem, WY-Sen R, 

**9:03 PM EST** Networks calling **TN-Sen** for Blackburn (R).  There does not seem to be any path for Democrats to take the Senate.

**9:44 PM EST** Texas Senate is surprisingly close given the overall national environment.  Lot of house races to be called but a lot of small dem leads in them that might give it to the dems.

**9:51 PM EST** NYT has their needle working finally and it is saying dems will win the House (and Beto will lose)

**10:00 PM EST** Polls closing in more states.  Romney wins UT-Sen.  Kobach called loser in KS-Gov to flip that to democrats.

**10:06 PM EST** After some initial freakout for Democrats, looking more like the middle range of the night we expected.  Biggest surprise so far is Donnovan in NY-11 (Staten Island) being ousted.  Very curious to see if that extends to the other NY metro area seats in contention (NY-1 and NY-2 on LI, where there are no results in yet).

**10:16 PM EST** Texas, and with it the Senate, have been called for Republicans, looks like Republicans will pick up 2 to 4 seats in the Senate.

**10:21 PM EST** Networks calling the House for democrats.

**10:42 PM EST** Little downballot news, FL amendment 4 has passed, restoring voting rights to about 1.4 million Floridians who have a felony conviction.  May be a big deal for future FL elections.

**10:55 PM EST** Looks like [Democrats will get a trifecta in New York State.](https://twitter.com/NickReisman/status/1060017122338844672)

**11:00 PM EST** More poll closings on the west coast.  Everything in the lower 48 is in (apart from people still in line to vote).  Lots more counting to do, but the headline for the night is known.

**11:13 PM EST** NYT projection now has FL-Sen at a 0.0 gap between the candidates.  Who likes Florida recounts?

**11:45 PM EST** Biggest upset of the night so far is in OK-05 where Democrat Kendra Horn has unseated Steve Russell in [a seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma%27s_5th_congressional_district) Trump won by 13, and Romney won by 18.

**11:48 PM EST** MO-Sen called for Republicans.  Their 3rd pickup of the night.

**11:49 PM EST** Anyone know why there's no results in Nevada yet?  Polls closed almost 2 hours ago.

**11:55 PM EST** More downballot news, Michigan [has passed a major election reform measure allowing same day registration and no excuse absentee voting.](https://twitter.com/PoliticsWolf/status/1060026162276122627)

**12:04 AM EST** Looks like Democrats will [break GOP supermajority in NC's House, and are leading but not called in enough to do so in the Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-north-carolina-elections.html) which had led to a lot of [veto overrides.](http://www.wbtv.com/story/38812360/nc-legislature-makes-quick-work-with-veto-overrides/)

**12:20 AM EST** ME-2 has both candidates under 50%, so it looks like this may be the first [usage of Maine's new ranked choice voting scheme.](https://bangordailynews.com/2018/11/06/politics/how-maine-is-handling-its-first-general-election-with-ranked-choice-voting/)

**12:24 AM EST** Finally got an answer as to why no results in Nevada, apparently no results are released until all votes are cast, and some people [have been in very long lines in the Reno area.](https://twitter.com/NVElect/status/1060039493745487873)

**12:32 AM EST** [Utah and Idaho have approved Medicaid expansion referenda.](https://twitter.com/JTHVerhovek/status/1060041180287787008)   Also looks like a close race in CT-Gov.

**12:48 AM EST** Since we have the headline results baked in, I am going to end the tick tock here.  There are a number of races still to be resolved, but we know who will control the houses of Congress.
