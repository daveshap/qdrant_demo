I want help breaking into the finance field
So I want to do a job where I can come to someone’s side and help them sort their finances. Not so much working for big businesses and helping them out but the average working mom or college grad. I really do not know how to go down this rabbit hole or where to begin so anyone got any pointers. I graduated college with a double major in sports management and business. Next spring I’ll have my MBA. So sadly no finance degree. Also I’ll be working at liberty National to start off my post college career path
