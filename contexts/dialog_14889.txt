SHAW: I'm not sure I understand.
JIM: Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
SHAW: I wouldn't imagine where.
JIM: We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you. Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
SHAW: No. Never heard of him.
JIM: A Perry Russo?
SHAW: No.
JIM: A Willie O'Keefe?
SHAW: No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
JIM: Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street. Do you recall that?
