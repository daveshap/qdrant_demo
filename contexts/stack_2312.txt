What is the criteria for feeding berries? I like feeding Pokemon with berries on gyms. However, it is not always allowed to feed them. I already know that you cant feed more than 10 in a certain period of time. I also know that you can't keep feeding the same Pokemon over and over again. what are the limits for feeding berries to Pokemon in gyms?
