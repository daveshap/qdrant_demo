Laid Off, Not Sure I Can Work 2 More Weeks
Almost every employee was laid off in March when we had to shut down due to stay at home orders. I've been working at home on a W-9 as a contractor for the past month, very limited hours. They decided on Friday to re-structure the corporate office to eliminate three positions to save money, including mine.

They want me to continue working for two more weeks, and have said that I can use office resource to job hunt during that time. At the end, I'll get my accrued vacation time paid out. However, I don't know if I can do it. I worked a little bit today, but they basically gave all of my responsibilities to another person with zero experience so they could lay me off. I'm just so hurt, frustrated, and angry. For my mental health's sake, I don't know how I'm supposed to work with these people for two more weeks after being cast aside.

What happens if I tell them that I can't work any more? I understand I'd end up forfeiting the vacation pay. Is there legal recourse they could take against me? What would they be allowed to tell potential employers who call while I'm job searching? Would this affect unemployment, since I technically filed and was approved when I was initially laid off a month ago?
