Is it normal to wish you were born in more interesting times?
I sometimes feel like I was born in more or less interesting times. As a kid growing up I read a lot of science fiction stories as well as watched a ton of sci fi TV shows. So I have expected that life in the future or 20 years from now would be different or almost unrecognizable than today. I am sad to say that I am in disappoint with how life has evolved. I sometimes dream of living in Sci fi universes like Star Trek or Star Wars just living an awesome existence in one of those universe. It seems like life in the real world is not that interesting and living a life in science fiction would be more exciting than here. Is this just me or do other people have these kinds of fantasy?
