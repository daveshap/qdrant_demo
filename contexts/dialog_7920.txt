ED: What happened?!
BELA: Isn't it wonderful? After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
ED: Bela, they're parasites! They just want to exploit you.
BELA: Fine. Let them! There is no such thing as bad press. A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page! First celebrity to ever check into rehab. When I get out of here, I will be healthy. Strong! I will be primed for my comeback!
KATHY: Oh, it's you again.
ED: Oh, hi.
KATHY: You look beat.
ED: I am. How's your father?
KATHY: He's better. Thank you for asking. How's your friend?
ED: Not good...
