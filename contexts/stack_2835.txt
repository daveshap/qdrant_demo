Pressure around nozzle of a syringe Around the nozzle of a syringe (which is filled with water and the piston is being pushed in), while applying Bernoulli's equation, will the pressure just outside the syringe be zero or atmospheric pressure? Also, will the velocity of water(not volumetric flow rate) just inside the syringe be zero or some value?Edit: This doubt stems from Irodov's problems in general physics problem 1.322. The question's solution says that pressure outside the nozzle would be zero and velocity inside would be zero, but I fail to understand how that would be correct. In another similar situation(Hole in an open water tank) pressure just outside the hole is always atmospheric pressure. Also, when a nozzle is being pushed with a constant force,i.e. continuous acceleration, shouldn't there be a buildup of velocity in the water in the syringe?
