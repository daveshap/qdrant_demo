Somewhere between r/povertyfinance and r/personal finance. Looking forward to growth in this new sub.
I live in the US, in a poverty filled state. Heck, my chosen neighborhood is at or below poverty level, on average. I'm a sole provider for a family of 3, and I feel as though we are afforded a fairly comfortable life, even at $34k. Most of the wealth growth and income growth that I hope for us is aimed at retirement and general betterment (Healthcare, quality of housing and education).

Anyhow, if this sub delivers at the same focus of quality and moderation as r/personalfinance, but with a focus more oriented to my own income level, I'm stoked.
