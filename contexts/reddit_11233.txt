I saw a cruel comment receive 700 upvoted and gold.
I just saw [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2bzj92/fie_friedrichsentook_her_two_years_to_lose_150/) about a truly stunning weight loss. I saved the picture to use for motivation, clicked to the comments, and saw the top comment (no longer top, but still gilded) about how "her cooter must look terrifying", followed by other similar jokes.

I have only about half the weight to lose that she did and I won't look half as good when I'm done. I actually managed to stick to my diet the past few days, but honestly, I just want to cry. All I can think is how the world is still going to find me disgusting IF I can even manage to get the weight off. 

Thanks for listening.
