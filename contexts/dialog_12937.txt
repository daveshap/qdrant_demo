TALLEY: This is Chief Talley. Tell me your name, son.
THOMAS: Thomas Smith. I'm in the house that's on TV. Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up. You gotta help him.
TALLEY: Slow down, Thomas. Take it easy and talk to me. Was your father shot?
THOMAS: Dennis hit him. His head's all big and he won't wake up. I'm really scared.
TALLEY: How about you and your sister?
THOMAS: We're okay.
TALLEY: Where are you right now?
THOMAS: In my room.
TALLEY: That's on the second floor. Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
THOMAS: They nailed the windows. I can't get'm open.
TALLEY: I've got the boy on the phone. He's using a cell phone. What was that, son? I didn't hear you.
THOMAS: If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras. They would see you outside, too --
