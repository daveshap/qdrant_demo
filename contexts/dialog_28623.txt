MCNAMARA: Starshells.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
MCNAMARA: I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
MCNAMARA: This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did? There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Yes, sir.
MCNAMARA: And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President. John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
