EVERETT: Fact of the matter - there never was!
PETE: But... but...
DELMAR: So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
EVERETT: I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
PETE: But...
EVERETT: Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it!
PETE: ...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
EVERETT: I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
PETE: ...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old.
DELMAR: Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
EVERETT: Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
