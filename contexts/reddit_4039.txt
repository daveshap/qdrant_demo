How many of you are lonely?
I am an introverted person [24F] who has never dated anyone before. Back home, I kept to myself and stayed home a lot. Then I moved to another about 5 months ago country and started trying to meet new people and make new friends. Despite attempts to put myself out there, still nothing has happened. 

This isn’t a post asking about what I should do because I know things take time and I’ll have to be patient. What I’m struggling with is the loneliness. I also know how to deal with the loneliness, i.e. have a hobby, find things to do, etc. and I’ve been doing all those as well. 

But the loneliness I’m talking about is one that you can’t shake off no matter how much concentration you’re putting into whatever you’re doing. It’s the kind of loneliness that makes you wish you had someone to text with all day. The kind of loneliness that makes you hate that the only notifications you receive are emails and social media. The kind that creeps back in after you’ve had a good time with friends or finished a good game session. 

This same loneliness is also felt back home because I have a very typical asian family where we don’t talk about things and show our feelings. So I’ve never felt homesick and am actually very happy to be away from home. 

How many of you feel the same way? And how many of you FELT the same way, and how was it like after you’ve been relieved of the pain?
