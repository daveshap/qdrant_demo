MARGO: Happy little housewife...
BILL: Cut it out.
MARGO: This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director-!
KAREN: Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
ADDISON: Hear, hear...
LLOYD: Now let's not get into a big hassle-
KAREN: It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
