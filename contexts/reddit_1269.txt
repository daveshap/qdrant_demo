My anxiety makes me feel that I am running out of time and I am only 21
I constantly keep giving myself markers or what I should be doing at my age, or what I should have accomplished till I am say 25, find love. 
I keep feeling like I could have achieved so much till my age but I didn't and now there's no going back. 
It's like my 20s are the years I must do everything, be the best version of myself but I constantly fail to do so, because of which I am and will remain a failure.
I feel like I'm running out of time.
