Is there any relationship between random numbers sampled from some continuous distribution D and the quantile function of D? I've noticed that when I sample n numbers from a continuous distribution D, sort them, and plot against the quantile function of D, both curves seem very similar. I've tried this for a few distributions (Gaussian, Weibull, Uniform, Gamma)) and I've seen the same behavior in all of them. Is there any connection between both?
