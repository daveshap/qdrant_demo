Thermal radiation from molten glass Molten glass, on photos, appears to radiate light like a black body. However, as cold glass absorbs almost no visible light, I would guess the emissivity for visible light is very low. So I am wondering, is the emissivity of molten glass surprisingly high, or does molten glass emit far less light than a black body?[ -- edit: I am mainly interested in the emissivity for visible light, not infrared ]
