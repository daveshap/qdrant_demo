Good reporter twitters for each country?
Hello everyone! I'm looking for reporter twitter accounts for various countries around the world...or in other words, reporters that specialize and/or reside in the country they report on. Some examples include:

- Rohollah Faghihi - @Faghihirohollah - Iran

- Jeffrey Smith - @Smith_JeffreyT - Africa, currently in Gambia

- Rukmini Callimachi - @rcallimachi - Middle East, Specializes in ISIS analysis


Does anyone know of a good list or just some personal recommendations? Thanks in advance!
