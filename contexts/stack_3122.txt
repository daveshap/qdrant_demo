Can sound with lower frecuency without overtones produce standing wave of higher frequency? I read that resonance appears if frequencies are equal. What if vocal cord produce only pure tone without harmonics, will voice still have overtones? Or will sound of guitar with only one string which produce only pure tone without harmonics still have  overtones?Added question:  Can sound(without overtones)  of frequency for example 220 Hz produce standing waves in cavity with natural frequency 440 HzFor example Helmholtz resonator reacts only on its own frequency of sound, but is there shape of cavity which react to lower frequency?One  more example pendulum with natural frequency 8 Hz can react to frequency 2 Hz or 4 Hz.
