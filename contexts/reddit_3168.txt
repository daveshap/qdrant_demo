Headhunter got upset after I turned down job, revealed a signing bonus that was never mentioned. Is this common?
I am a remote contractor and was contacted by a headhunter with an opportunity at a local firm. I interviewed, they liked me, and made me a job offer. Offer good, but not good enough - about a $10k income drop plus a 30 minute commute and all the other unknowns that come with a new job.
Odd stuff occurred as well, hiring manager called me and said headhunter asked him to give me a call, “he didn’t really know why” and then said, “do you have specific questions on your offer?”
What offer?
Turns out they had sent an offer letter that day. So he gives me the verbal, and it is ok, but doesn’t make me giddy, and I say, “thanks, I’ll look it over.”
It’s Friday. Takes them a while to get me a benefit premium breakdown. Insurance costs lower, but numbers don’t add up, I still have a $10k deficit. I like working remotely, in an earlier time zone, in my PJs. So I call the hiring manager and tell him it is a soft no, and he says, “well if you change your mind we have a lot if hiring to do.”
Headhunter emails me saying, “what happened? I specifically told you to contact me if the numbers were off. We have a significant amount of money earmarked for this situation. I guess I’ll never understand.”
So three things struck me:
1) the assumption that it was the money (well, TBH I made the mistake(?) of telling them what I was making, so she knew there was a gap)
2) this “significant amount of money” was never mentioned until after the fact
3) the “I guess I’ll never understand” makes me think this same scenario has played out at least once (and probably several times) before.

I think I am going to stop using headhunters. In my last 2 interactions, I was harassed to disclose “the number I would take”. I guess I’ll never understand.
