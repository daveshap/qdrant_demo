JOANNA: I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
NICKY: This is how we've managed to last.
JOANNA: We're able to surprise each other.
NICKY: In and out of bed.
JOANNA: Because we're completely mismatched.
NICKY: We don't even like each other, do we?
JOANNA: I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
NICKY: The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
JOANNA: It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
NICKY: It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
JOANNA: It's your best play, Nicky.
NICKY: They'll lose because they're my team.
JOANNA: He will absolutely hate it.
NICKY: I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
DRIVER: You are going where?
NICKY: Crosstown.
DRIVER: Very bad today.
