WENDY: I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
PIXEL: Clever observation. Go back to Wichita. Oh that's right, you can't.
PIXEL: ...sorry...
WENDY: This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!
PIXEL: One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
WENDY: Yeah. And?
PIXEL: It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.
ERIC: There you are! Man, I don't know how to thank...
WICHITA: Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
ERIC: Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.
