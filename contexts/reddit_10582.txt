Talk about a curveball...
Today (1/30) at 5:15 PM, my mother suddenly passed away while I was at school. With this happening, I no longer have any parents. As I type this, I'm not as emotional as I thought I'd be. I guess it may be shock? Regardless, my mind is going at a million miles per hour right now... I'm in college and now my mother will never see me graduate from a 4-year college, move out of the house, or any other life achievement. I'm not sure if I can continue... I loved her so much.
