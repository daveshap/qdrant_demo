I just paid off my student loans.
I don't have anyone to be excited for me, but you folks can appreciate the struggle. 

It only took 10 years! ðŸ˜‚

Edit: Thanks for all the upvotes! You guys are awesome! 

A little more background information! 

I tried the best I could to not incur school debt, but I was a first generation high school graduate and definitely had no idea what I was doing. In the end, I borrowed ~$30,000 for school loans, which in the grand scheme of things wasn't much, but I'm glad to be out from under it. 

I took the semester off between high school and starting at community college. I worked 84 hours a week and saved up a tidy sum to help me through the first semester. I had a pretty decent scholarship/grant package that paid my tuition for my first 2 years of community college. I worked part-time in my field to gain experience. I transferred to a Big 10 School, and received a similar financial aid deal for tuition, working full time in the summer. 

I used student loans to buffer my paltry paychecks, allowing me to live in an off-campus apartment, by myself, and save my sanity. I also used some money to travel, and to attend lots of work shops related to my field. I worked an AmeriCorps stint after graduation that paid a lump sum toward my loans, but the rest has been diligently plugging away at them.
