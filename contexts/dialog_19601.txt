NEIL: Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
MAX: Say listen, Doc. I got a new theory about all these suicides.
NEIL: Don't hold back on us, Max. We need all the help we can get.
MAX: Fucked up chromosomes, man. Think about it. Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
NEIL: It beats Dr. Simm's theory. She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
MAX: Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
NEIL: Good morning, Jennifer.
JENNIFER: Morning, Doctor Goldman.
NEIL: How's your hand?
JENNIFER: Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
NEIL: They're healing up nicely.
JENNIFER: I've been good. When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
NEIL: Don't hold your breath.
