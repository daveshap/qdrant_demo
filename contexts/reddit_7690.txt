Those of you who either chose to leave or were kicked out of grad school - what do you "do" now?
Hello! I previously asked this question in another subreddit, but wanted to post it here for more info.


I am currently a 2nd year graduate student who is studying genetics. Last spring semester, I ended up on academic probation. I managed to get my GPA up to a 3.0 during the summer, but I am now struggling with a difficult required course this semester. (Yes, I do study a lot and ask the professor questions)




Anyway, I just wanted to know what other possible careers exist just in case I can't finish grad school. I am especially curious about the following:



* What was your initial reaction after leaving? How did you feel?



* For your current job, did you need to get any additional education or certifications?



* Do you feel any regret about being unable/choosing not to finish grad school?


* Is there something about your current job that makes you feel happier than being a grad student?




Thanks to anyone and everyone who replies! :)
