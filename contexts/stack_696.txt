Install Ubuntu on m.2 SSD independently I have a dell 7559 with a 250GB SSD loaded with windows 10. I have another 275GB m.2 (Crucial) and I want to install Linux on it. Is it possible to install two OS in such a manner that they work completely independently without sharing any common space? That is, when I will use Linux it will show 275GB memory space (m.2) and when I will use Windows it will show 250GB memory space (original SSD). If yes then how should I proceed? Is such a separation better than dual boot with a common memory space in terms of performance?
