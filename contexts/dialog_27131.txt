KAWAKITA: If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
MARGO: But at what a price.
MARGO: I have the species identification on these teeth. We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program. Call Dr. Frock. He wanted a demonstration.
KAWAKITA: Margo, you haven't heard?
MARGO: What?
KAWAKITA: Frock's been fired.
MARGO: That's impossible.
KAWAKITA: I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me. Telegraph. Telephone. Tell Kawakita. I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary. This is Dr. Frock's last week.
