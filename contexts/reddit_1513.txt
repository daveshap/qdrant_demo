Anyone else feel psychological pain is worse than physical pain?
If I had major chronic pain issues, my opinion would be different, but I get mild pain sometimes as most people do, but for me I'm acutely aware of my bodily sensations and it leads to anxiety and often intense panic attacks.  Even though I should be aware that the pain I'm feeling is from something I already understand that I have like acid reflux, my mind wants to connect some dots and believe I might be having an emergency situation.  No matter how many times it turns out to be nothing, I can't help but think it's not going to be nothing this time.  I feel like this fear is a thousand times worse than the pain itself.  I would take pain that is a couple times worse than the pain I get if it would mean I never have to feel anxiety.  It's to a point.  I've had an intense ear infection that I would trade for a panic attack.
