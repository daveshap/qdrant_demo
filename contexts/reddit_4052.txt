Some Things I've Been Doing to Get Over My Ex
Some things I've done to help me get over my ex dumping me. The basic idea behind all of these is that you should do thoughtful things you would've done for your ex, but now just do it for strangers/people you care about.  Some examples:

1. Randomly bought my roommate fudge and ice cream when he had a bad day.
2. Gifted flowers to some of my girl neighbors, with a note wishing them a great day.
3. Took myself and/or a friend on a date.  I personally like smoothie dates.
4. Danced to my favorite music in my room. Rediscovered old songs, discovered new ones.
5. Volunteered. I started doing manicures for old people at a retirement home.  I've never done or had a manicure in my life. It's been a fun learning process haha.
6. Worked out.  I'm already a pretty fit guy, but now that I have the extra motivation you can bet I'm gonna be setting some new PRs.
7. Dove even deeper into hobbies.  Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and music production have been saving my ass.

Some inspiration to those with an aching heart that are trying to figure out healthy ways of not just sitting in bed obsessing over their ex.  To recap: **Do shit you would've done for her while you were in the relationship, but now do it for others.**

It's hard to not make them look like a monster for dumping you when your goto coping mechanism is to kill them with kindness ;)
