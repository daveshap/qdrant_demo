CLAY: I've got eleven horses.
STEVE: Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
MARY: They won't be riding in the wagon.
CLAY: Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
MARY: You can't leave us here.
CLAY: Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
MARY: What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
CLAY: You can stay here if you like.
MARY: We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
CLAY: I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
