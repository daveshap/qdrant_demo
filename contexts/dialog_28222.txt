CAUCHON: Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
BUCK: How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?! I've had enough!
CAUCHON: Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is. This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
BUCK: So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight! Don't you understand? They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
CAUCHON: It is not for us to burn her, my lord. That is your prerogative.
BUCK: ... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
CAUCHON: But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
BUCK: Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys: go and torture the bitch!
CAUCHON: You won't be able to drag anything from her that way. You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
BUCK: Scared of a girl?
CAUCHON: Scared to make a mistake. Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
BUCK: Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
CAUCHON: I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church. Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
BUCK: Well find some other way! Be creative. Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that? Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
