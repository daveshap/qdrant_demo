What is the best way to handle a highly influential but difficult subordinate?
I work part time lecturing at a small college.  I do it on the side because I really really enjoy it.  When I joined another professional joined and we have taught together over the last several semesters.  After the first semester I was asked to coordinate for the course, basically insure that all the sections were the same--i.e. students got the same content regardless of professor.  Both of us have very different styles, but in the end we teach the same material.

Early on I recognized that our course needed updates, I worked with admin and got those updates implmented.  Needless to say, those changes have not been well received.  I solicited the other professor for feedback on numerous occasions without success, so in essence all changes were my changes.  Now with all of the new material, I get passive aggressive messages about when are we going to stop changing (with cc to multiple admin levels for the tiniest detail).  Also the individual has stopped communicating directly with me.

Here's my conundrum--this person is a C-level executive at their normal job and I am basically a peon.  They bring a ton of prestige to the program, while I bring only my wit and excitement for teaching.  In addition to the above, there are several 'unprofessional' behaviors (nothing scandalous, this is academia, so just think 'rude') I have observed during conferences--this person is obviously aware of their import and like to remind everyone of it.

How do I deal with this individual. What are some strategies to at least get this person in line with what we want to teach without undermining me at every step.  While I am technically 'in charge' of the course, I have no power to sit them down and say "We need to address this behavior" and every meeting I have ever scheduled has been blown off (even before any changes were made, we've always had a distant relationship)--in addition our teaching is remote.  My admin is sympathetic to my plight, but I know that the students sense the friction (he \[ed. sorry typo\] openly badmouth me in his classes, perhaps forgetting that everything is recorded, and me watching his videos is my way of making sure we are synched, while I release my notes/slides/videos to all sections) and our teaching has diverged to the point where he blew off the final I wrote, something I was very passionate about as it gave our students some real-world style experience.
