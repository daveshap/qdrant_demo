How to Get Into Stanford.....By Someone Who Didn't.
# Introduction

My name is Robab. I wanted to go to Stanford since I was eleven years old. Since the day I set foot on Stanford's campus, I studied my ass off in high school, did what I was passionate about, wrote and edited my Stanford essays years before I even applied, did killer extracurricular activities, and burned myself getting good standardized test scores. I read every blog possible and watched every YouTube video about how to get into Stanford. I was confident I would also get in, but not too confident, because I knew the acceptance rate.

I never really thought about getting a rejection letter.

For years, I compiled my thoughts about applying to Stanford into several Google Docs. After my rejection, I've been reviewing what worked, what didn't, and how I would've changed my application to get in. I'm a lot wiser now, a lot more aware about the things I *should've* done, and less blind to what accepted Stanford students *told* me I needed to do.

# Standardized Testing: the Thing that Matters Least

I knew this even while applying, but for some applicants it really hasn't hit them yet. Tests don't matter. Nor do they in life. As long as you have 700+s in each section of the SAT, or subject SAT, you're fine. If you have high 600s, you'll be okay if you're low-income or a minority (black, hispanic, or an underrepresented Asian like Vietnamese). You'll notice that accepted students on the internet who post "Got Into Stanford With Low \_\_\_\_\_" are a minority. And that's OK. Stanford and schools in general need diversity, and historically minorities have been oppressed so they can't pay to get top-notch levels of education or retake SATs to get higher scores. But I'm speaking the truth and the reality: you need above 700s if you're not a minority to be accepted. Very, very, very rare circumstances may be otherwise.

If you're wondering what my scores were, you really shouldn't be concerned. Because again, all were above 700s. But, for those who care a bit too much: 1520 SAT (770M/750R), 780 Molecular Biology. On my application, I wrote that my race was White (Middle Eastern). If you were rejected and all your scores were above 700s, then you were rejected for a reason other than your scores...

# Being Interesting: the Thing that Matters Most and the Reason You'll Get Rejected

We like to think when you're rejected from a school, especially a top school, it was because of any or some of the following: a low SAT/ACT score, a low GPA, a low class-rank, or extracurricular activities that don't reach the state/national/international level.

But we often forget another thing entirely: we simply weren't interesting enough. Before you call the cops on me, let me explain:

Since the beginning of high school, most of us (who are inevitably rejected) treat college as something pre-determined for us. We know we're going to college, we just want to get into the most highly ranked school so that we get oos and aahs from other people. So then we tailor our extracurriculars to things that we like doing that we also think colleges want to see. We start a business, because we're passionate about business... but also because we think colleges will love to see that we started one. Perhaps we start a cosmetic business, because we like makeup but also because starting a business is impressive....to colleges. We join clubs. We do laboratory research, because we like science and also because it yields tangible results that colleges will be impressed by. Perhaps we create nanoparticles and culture cancer cells.

But imagine if you *never thought about college* in your choice of extracurriculars at all? Would you pursue what you actually, truly love? Like....horse-back riding? Hiking? Would you binge-watch Korean dramas, only to inevitably teach yourself the Korean language? Would you repeatedly try to learn how to cook the perfect egg? Would you go to Washington D.C. and protest for human rights, and then get tear-gassed by the police?

The reason you were rejected was because of three things, which are all tied together: (1) to some degree or another, you think about college when you decide what to pursue, (2) you or your story isn't interesting enough, and (3) you haven't fully realized yourself. Let me explain:

When you start to think about college, you won't pursue things like horse-back riding or protesting, perhaps because you think that its not "academic" or impressive enough. You won't try over and over again to try to cook the perfect egg. Because you don't pursue what interests you in the moment, you become bland. In your essays, you'll talk about how how you made $1000 from your cosmetic business and how that was really hard to achieve, instead of laughing over how you fell down in front of 1000 people at a human rights protest. Instead of talking about how you love Korean dramas and taught yourself the language, you'll write about how fascinated you are with Persian art....when truly, deeply, and literally....you're not that fascinated with it. And now matter how much you embellish your essays with "it sparked my curiosity" and "I delved into the intricacies of \_\_\_\_\_ and found myself lost and amazed", you'll seem bland and uninteresting. And then, because you didn't pursue the wilderness called life, you won't fully realize yourself. You won't see your vulnerabilities. You won't see your flaws. You'll become sheltered and blind to your faults and your strengths because you stay indoors all day. You'll write essays that don't reveal much about you, simply because you don't know much about yourself. Your teachers will write recommendations that will commend you, but they'll describe you in a way that won't differentiate you from other bland, sheltered applicants.

You'll think that you'll seem interesting to the admissions committee, because you started, say, a cosmetic business (and you know no other applicant has done that), but AdCom won't see it that way. They want people who are truly, really, literally, fully *human*. They want humans who are mature beyond their years, because they've been through narratives in life that seem so rare these days and perhaps a bit outdated. They want humans who can reveal their flaws, their faults, their insecurities, who are okay with admitting about the time they were racist or homophobic or unjustifiably angry, and who don't care what others think of them. They've grown from their teenage angst or their ableist mindset, and become a better person. They're not proud of what they did or maybe who they used to be. But instead of comparing themselves to another person today, like some other accepted Stanford applicant, they compared themselves to who they were yesterday. And they grew. They matured. They became unique, interesting, memorable, and impressive.

You weren't rejected because you had low stats or bad extracurriculars. You were rejected because you were.....boring.

# Authenticity = Acceptance? Kinda.

Let's face it. Some people's authentic selves are simply boring. My "authentic" self is 99% composed of pedagogical philosophy. Bleh. If I was my "authentic" self on my application, I'd be reciting the words of Kant and Nietzsche all over my essays, over and over again. I would, without a doubt, be like the annoying little girl who bores her friends to death by talking about her crush over and over again.

I watched a couple of YouTube videos before and while I was applying, and there was a unanimous theme to them: be authentic. So that's what I did. In my essays, I talked about how fascinated I was with art and philosophy and introspection. But my application became....boring. Yes, I was fascinated with philosophy. Yes, I was being my authentic self. But it didn't make me memorable or interesting. And because I was too sheltered, too naive to truly reflect on my flaws and weaknesses, I became *even more* boring.

My common application essay I sent to Stanford was about walking. About what I think about when I walk for thirty minutes every day, and used it as a metaphor for destination. You can find all of my essays, including my common app, here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1otyVqRTWfjXcJa6WIM61sLIGFiUuHBc6QK1bDMDysWs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1otyVqRTWfjXcJa6WIM61sLIGFiUuHBc6QK1bDMDysWs/edit?usp=sharing)

I realized after my rejection letter that almost my whole application-- *especially my common application essay--* was so fucking serious. Other than the roommate essay, I never cracked a joke or laughed or cursed or did the things that made me funny or interesting. After my rejection, I ended up rewriting my entire common application essay.....on bread. Yes. Bread. I cracked three jokes in that essay. For my Princeton application, I wrote a poem about my Dad's love of Drake. I did indeed utter the word "ass" in that poem.

So by April 1st, I'll edit this post to update you guys if my new insight helped me get into Harvard, Princeton, Yale, or Dartmouth. If I got into some of them, we'll know *for sure* that interesting > authenticity.

Now I know that all of you are going to say: what the hell, Robab! You're supposed to be *honest* in your application! Authenticity matters more than being interesting!

Well, duh. I'm not saying lie or be a fake bitch. I'm saying highlight the small, teeny endearing parts of you that make you interesting. Ask yourself: what do you talk about with your group of friends that makes your friends laugh? What makes them deeply interested in what you have to say? In other words, talk about your love of Korean television instead of your love of Immanuel Kant. No one is really that interested in hearing you talk about the latter.

# The Importance of Specificity

So here's my advice: to be interesting, first you have to stop caring about college, do the wild things that actually, genuinely interest you, and be a bit daring. Curse if that's who you are. Reveal your flaws and vulnerabilities. But after you do those things, the next best lesson is to be specific.  *Things that are interesting are inherently specific.* If a Stanford interviewer asks you, "What do you like to do on your free time?" and you say "read books"....um okay....yeah maybe, but that's not specific. Everyone fucking likes to read. What if instead you said: "I like to read books about the theory of justice" or "I like to read books about the economic effects on Russia caused by crippling deforestation". Now...we're getting interesting. If an essay asks you, "what do you care about and why", don't say "memes". Fucking everyone likes memes. Instead, what about "Kermit the frog memes, especially those where he's drinking Lipton tea"?

Okay, but now you're asking: Robab, how the fuck do I be specific. I'm not that interesting. I slouch on my couch and chew bubble gum all day.

Uhhhhhhhh. Can you maybe chill????

Here's how to be a specific self-reflector in five minutes: copy paste the questions down below into a word document, set a timer for 5 minutes, and answer each question in 5 minutes. The Rules? Don't delete or backspace anything you type (even spelling errors) and type as much as you possibly can under the time limit.

1. Describe your room. Why did you design it this way?
2. Describe why you like what you wear.
3. Describe what you eat for dinner.
4. Describe why you watch what you watch on YouTube.
5. Describe why you like your favorite book.
6. Describe why you like your favorite subject.

Then when you're done answering all the questions, review your answers. Does anything seem like it's so unique to you? For instance, on question 1, I wrote "my black Michael Kors purse sits atop my black Ikea table next to a white bed and white dresser". For question 3, I wrote "I eat salmon and carrots and rice nearly every dinner and I like it because its healthy". Now I know two broad things about myself: I love chic black/white design and healthy foods. Then I can specify in my supplements or essays why these things are unique to me: my whole room is filled with only black or white objects, and I eat "salmon and carrots" literally every day. These little details make me memorable. In fact, if you asked my friends to describe me, they'd say I'm a health freak and that if you wanted to spot me in a crowd of a hundred people, to look for the girl with the black Michael Kors purse and red coat. Because that's literally what I wear every. single. day.

And again: AdComs want people with interesting stories that make them human. Simply saying "I value health and fashion" or "I love design and draw sketches of cars" is too broad and describes many people. It's the small things that are descriptive and make you, you.

## The Interview

In your interview, be specific.  When the interviewer asks, “what would you do with 1 million dollars” most people say something like “donate to charity”.  This is amazing, but, *what charity?  Why that charity?  What makes you want to donate to charity instead of start a hedge fund?*  Furthermore, when they ask “if you were to teach a class, what would you teach?” don’t say “math” or “science”.  Be very specific, like: “I would teach a class on how transindividual power relations in a society change people’s behavior”. Again, these small details make you memorable, complex, and human.

# Teacher Recommendations

You want to pick teachers that fulfill as many of these characteristics as possible:

* They've known you really well. They even know the quirky, kinda awkward side of you. You should have talked to them for over two years in highschool and have gotten to know each other.
* They've written recommendations that get their students into great colleges, such as Stanford.
* They're known to be a fantastic writer (typically an English teacher is a phenomenal writer)
* They're a deep, thoughtful, and even possibly a philosophical and abstract individual, at least compared to your other teachers.

Here’s why:

* If they know you well, they will validate what you say on your application.  This is great, since Stanford probably ranks applicants on how well they reflect their personality by matching what they say about themselves to what others say about themselves.
* Recommendations that get kids into Stanford are usually a great indicator that the teacher is a strong recommender.
* If they like you and are a great writer, they will be a strong recommender.
* Deep, thoughtful teachers can probably see things inside you that you aren't be able to see within yourself. They add dimensionality and complexities to your application that make you seem more....*alive.*

*Don't* pick teachers simply because:

* You've known them the longest
* You have the best grade in their class
* They teach the field you want to major in, and you're afraid that if you pick a teacher who didn't teach you for a field you're passionate about it will look badly and incongruous in your application.

# AP Scores

I’d employ either one of two strategies in reporting your AP scores: (1) report all of the ones you got either a 3, 4, or 5 on, or (2) report only the AP subjects that matter to you.  Here’s why only reporting 5s is a bad idea: if you’re the typical kid like me with a good mix of 3s, 4s, and 5s, you may end up realizing that you got 5s on tests that didn’t matter to you and 3s on tests that mattered a lot to you.  For me, for example, I could have cared less about the Calculus (5), Psychology (5), and Statistics (4) classes/scores but I really valued my English Language (3) and World History (4) classes/scores (in fact, I was getting teacher recommendations from my English Lang and World History teachers).  If I just ended up reporting Psychology and Calculus, admit officers could have been confused as to what classes and scores I actually valued. So I encourage you to either be brave and submit all your scores, like I did, or send the ones that matter to you.

There's also a super easy way to study for AP tests. It's called Anki. People freak out about AP exams but if they have the right materials and the right mindset, they'll be okay. You need a focused mindset to study for AP exams, but you also need good materials. Anki is the best material you can ever have to study for anything. Not Barrons. Not Princeton Review. Not Kaplan.

Anki is a flashcard software you can download into your computer. It's based on cognitive science, and designed to maximize long-term memorization of information.

Listen: the reason most people do badly on exams is not necessarily because they didn't study, it's because they can't remember. Ever studied for ten hours for a test, or crammed three hours the night before, and still got an F? That's because you can't remember the information well enough to recall it during the exam.

To use Anki, you type up your flashcards for a specific topic, and then you go through them. After every flashcard, you "rate" how easy/hard it was to recall the information on the flashcard. Depending on how you rate it, Anki will then repeat the flashcard to you some variable time later. It keeps repeating it until recalling the information on the flashcard gets easier and easier. And once it gets easier and easier, you retain the information on the cards for longer and longer, up to several years if you study them often. If you use Anki, there's no doubt you can recall the information needed on AP exams, and will get 5s on them, no matter what prep book you use.

My experience with Anki? It took me from 3s and 4s on my exams to 5s. It took me from a 670 on my SAT Molecular Biology test to a 780 in two months. It brought my grades sophomore year from 6 As and 2Bs (taking 1 AP and 7 honors) to all 3A+s and 5As junior year (taking 6 APs and 2 honors).

The prep-book wasn't what I needed. It was Anki.

# And lastly: the GPA.

Your parents are gonna say it.  Your teachers are gonna say it. You’re gonna say it.  The whole world says it. But it’s wrong.

**You don’t need a 4.billion GPA to get into an Ivy League.**

Now admittedly, you do need a high class rank, most preferably the top 2%. Of course, class rank is not the best measurement for admit officers to see how much you can offer to a college, because every high school is different, and every class of seniors is different.  So what you *do* need is a weighted GPA of above 4.0, an unweighted GPA of at or above 3.75, and a class rank in the top 5-10%. And that's it.

Also, FYI: Stanford recalculates your GPA into their own scale called the SU6.  Essentially the SU6:

* considers only academic (not PE!) courses and
* courses taken after freshman year.
* To calculate the new GPA: A+=A=A-=4.0, B+=B-=B=3.0, etc.  Sum all them up and divide by the number of courses.

This SU6 helps admit officers calibrate all their candidates on the same scale, because some schools do 100.00 GPAs, some 5.00 GPAs, etc.

What GPAs did I have, you ask?

* Unweighted: 3.86
* Weighted: 4.29
* Class rank: 11% (like...50/470 something people?)
* Stanford’s SU6: 3.91

Thanks guys! Hope you can glean a lot of information from this post.  You can also find this post on r/GetIntoStanford. But always remember: if you stop caring so much about getting into college, and you start caring about things you actually like doing, you will get into the college of your dreams and be the best person you can be.

Peace be upon all of you. Good luck.

EDIT: (1) This is an opinion post, and though I don’t have sources, my speculation was gathered upon my experience and hearing the experiences of nearly a hundred other accepted Stanford students (either by DM, blog, YouTube, Instagram, or released documents/statistics by the university).  I, nor really anyone except AdCom, knows what really happens at the table.  (2) My essays in the attached link were read by about 10 Stanford undergraduates who said overall that they were very good, but needed tweaking, before submission.  I tweaked them accordingly.  You might read them and decide to believe otherwise.  (3) I am female.

Thanks for all the nice comments and support! I’m so glad I could help out.
