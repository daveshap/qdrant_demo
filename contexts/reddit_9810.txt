Using a nursing degree in Student Affairs?
Hi everyone, 

I have a little different situation that I haven't really seen anyone ask here. I graduated from a small college with a Nursing degree. During my time there, I was an RA, and learned that I wanted to continue in SA against my nursing degree. I then become an Assistant Residence Director while I worked on my Masters in Nurse Education. About 6 months into this position, I was offered a position as a Residence Director.

Since then, I have completed my masters degree, and still work as an RD. I enjoy what I do, and the people I work with, however have completely grown out of the "Live-in" scenario of an RD. I'm now looking into new positions that I can hopefully incorporate the last 6 years of my school life.

My question to you all is: Are there any Student Affair positions out there that I could incorporate my nursing degrees into to?

I am located north of Boston, MA, if that helps anyone. Thanks!!
