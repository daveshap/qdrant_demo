CHRIS: That's a beautiful name. French?
BASQUIAT: Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
CHRIS: What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
BASQUIAT: Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
CHRIS: What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that? What is it â€“ did your girlfriend leave you?
BASQUIAT: No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
CHRIS: You see? You have someone to live for.
BASQUIAT: No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
CHRIS: What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it."
BASQUIAT: You don't even know me. I want real respect.
CHRIS: What? What do you want?
BASQUIAT: Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
