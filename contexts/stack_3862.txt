How to get any quantiles given median value and margin of error? I am trying to get the values of the 25th and 75th quantile of the population based on two values that summarizes the samples:median value90 percent margin of errorI don't have any other information including the sample size, standard error, etc.. And I think it 's safe to assume the samples were drawn from a normal distribution.The 90 percent margin of error in the original document is described as follows:<blockquote>  The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. </blockquote>Edit: added the description of the margin of error to clarify the question.
