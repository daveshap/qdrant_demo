VERA: Will you stop interrupting ?! You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
ROSS: And then shut down the pipe lines.
GUS: Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
ROSS: Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
GUS: Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
ROSS: I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
GUS: The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
