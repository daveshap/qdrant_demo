ENID: Boo!
SEYMOUR: YAAA!
ENID: Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
SEYMOUR: Really?
ENID: No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
SEYMOUR: I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
ENID: Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
SEYMOUR: Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
ENID: So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
SEYMOUR: Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
ENID: Sounds good...
SEYMOUR: We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
ENID: What, are you trying to get rid of me?
SEYMOUR: No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
ENID: Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
SEYMOUR: I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
ENID: I dunno... okay, I guess... I fucked that guy Josh finally...
SEYMOUR: ...so... is he your boyfriend now?
ENID: Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
DANA: Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
SEYMOUR: Dana! Hi! Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
DANA: Hello...
