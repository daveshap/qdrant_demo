RUBY: You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
FELICITY: Baby? And what baby is that?
RUBY: Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
FELICITY: Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
RUBY: What are you talking about?
FELICITY: An abortion, stupid. I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore. Bye-bye, baby!
