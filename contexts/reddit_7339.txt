Coca Cola job posting… more info?
Coca Cola is hiring in my area for *Logistics Operator II*. the post doesn’t explain if training will be provided but it states that a forklift , pallet jack, jack stand, glad hand locks, and yard dog will at some point be used. none of these listed i have dealt with in my job experience. does anyone here know if training is provided on site after being hired? i would assume so, but it’s not stated.

also, if anyone knows what the hours are like for this job; days worked, if it’s shift work, etc.
