Literally dying inside
My partner of 16 years, and wife of 6 months, came home from a trip to Ireland to ask for a divorce. Completely out of the blue. Turns out she met someone over there that "she fell in love with" (that cut her off, yay) and made her realize she needs to "find herself" without me (forever).

Then the other day, after two beers, I failed a check stop and got a DUI. Licensed suspended for at least 90 days.

I am literally gutted inside and think about suicide literally every minute of the day. 

I'm abusing alcohol and cannabis just to get through the day.

How do you even think about the future when you're entire life has been destroyed?

(I already see a psychologist and psychiatrist for Bipolar 2)


EDIT: I'm honestly blown away by the number of supportive comments, and zero negative comments, received from this group. To answer a bunch of questions: yes I am trying to quit alcohol, although this weekend wasn't great, I'm using cannabis for now, I got a prescription for Ativan to get rid of the panic attacks, I was going to the gym daily until I lost my transportation, and I'm struggling to get outside even to walk the dogs. Today's my appointment with my lawyer regarding the DUI... 

Thank you all again.
