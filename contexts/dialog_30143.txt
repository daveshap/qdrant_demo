FENSTER: I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
KEATON: Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
FENSTER: Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
KEATON: This whole thing was a shakedown.
KEATON: How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
FENSTER: So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
KEATON: It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
FENSTER: I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
