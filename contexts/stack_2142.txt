How is Cooldown Reduction applied? I am currently running a Zer0 build that depends heavily on replenishing health and shields using the Holo Decoy (Action Skill). I have a Legendary Hunter Class Mod with +40% Cooldown Rate and a Proficiency Relic with +35.8% Cooldown rate. I'm interested in how those values are applied. Do they work additively or multiplicatively? Also, is there a hard cap on how low the cooldown can get? And finally, if I cancel my Action Skill early, is the total cooldown reduction applied to the full cooldown or the reduced cooldown time?Edit: Also, the items say 'Cooldown Rate' -- what exactly does that mean? Is it the same as a Cooldown reduction (i.e. 40% CR \u2192 60% Cooldown remaining) or is there like an Action Skill Bar that fills at a certain rate to which the Cooldown Rate Multiplier is applied?
