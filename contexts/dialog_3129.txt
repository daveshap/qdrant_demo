GRISSOM: It's not the girl, Jack. Sooner or later you would've tried to take me. You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
JACK: I've died once already. It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
GRISSOM: Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
JACK: JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
GRISSOM: Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
JACK: HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
