MARYLIN: I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
SARAH: Well what does he want?

SARAH: He has a reputation for being tough.
MARYLIN: Lilly's up.

MARYLIN: Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
SARAH: Shit.
MARYLIN: Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
