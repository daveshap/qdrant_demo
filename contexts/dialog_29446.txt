ROBERT: Can you tell me anything? Do you have any ideas?
SETH: I don't know what to say.
ROBERT: I'm not the police. I don't care about experimentation. She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
SETH: You won't say anything to my parents?
ROBERT: I don't give a fuck about your parents --
SETH: We sometimes went downtown to score.
ROBERT: What?
SETH: The West End. We buy it off the streets. I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
ROBERT: You don't know what the hell you're talking about. You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away. And neither does she.
