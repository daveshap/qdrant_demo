EMMETT: ...Gotta go...
MAL: Sure.
EMMETT: Where are we?
MAL: Someplace safe. How you feeling?
EMMETT: I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
MAL: I didn't just come along. I was looking for you. Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
EMMETT: That's it.
MAL: This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
EMMETT: I'm sorry.
EMMETT: I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
MAL: You'll never make it.
EMMETT: Have to.
MAL: I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
EMMETT: Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
MAL: So far that's all I seen in this life.
