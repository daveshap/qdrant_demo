LILLY: Oh, thanks, Bobo.
BOBO: You want a drink?
LILLY: Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
BOBO: See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
LILLY: He's a good kid. A salesman.
BOBO: On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
