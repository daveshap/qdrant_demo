MACKELWAY: Agent Mackelway.
DYLAN: Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
MACKELWAY: Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
DYLAN: What's the bad news?
MACKELWAY: You tell me.
DYLAN: No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
MACKELWAY: I'm on my way.
MACKELWAY: Hey, Sheriff.
DYLAN: Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
MACKELWAY: What does the Manager say?
DYLAN: I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
MACKELWAY: Let's take a look.
