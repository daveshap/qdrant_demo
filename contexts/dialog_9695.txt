BOBBY: Now, hand...
BOBBY: Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
RAYETTE: You're goin' a find me dead one time.
BOBBY: Sssh, come on now... Be a good girl.
RAYETTE: If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
BOBBY: I'm not going to get up an' leave you. Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
RAYETTE: Do you love me, Bobby?
