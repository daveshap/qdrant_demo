I started reading again
For as long as I remember, I loved reading. Depression (and high school and college) took that away from me. I've recently started up again, after something like 5 years of no reading at all, except for school and internet. I've already reread one of my favorites (The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller! Great book, if you love mythology). I forgot how awesome it is to lose yourself in a book for hours and hours. I'm so fucking happy!! My advice to anyone who's like me: start small. For me, I said I'd read at least 2 pages a day, but you can do it with any amount! I've found that if you set a goal too big too soon you'll get intimidated and give up sooner. Good luck!!
