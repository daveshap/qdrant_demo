TATIANA: I will not leave without the twins.
PAUL: We have to get out of here Tatiana.
TATIANA: Please, please try one more time.
PAUL: I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
MR. GARINDI: It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
PAUL: I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
MR. GARINDI: No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
PAUL: How do you know?
MR. GARINDI: Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
PAUL: I will give you my house.
