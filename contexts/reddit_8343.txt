The recent raid in Yemen - is it accurate that this operation was 'botched'? What are the accurate numbers of civilians killed, and could the death of the Navy SEAL have been avoided?
Most media articles I'm reading refer to the raid as botched, and point out that Trump was not present in the Situation Room, or that the plans were discussed 'over dinner'. I'm not sure that these particular details confirm the idea that the operation was 'botched', but are an attempt to highlight a lack of attention to the operation. This may or may not be accurate that the President ordered the raid without proper thought and attention, which is a difficult claim to answer. How accurate is the claim that the raid was botched - meaning to say, is this level of civilian casualties (most media reporting 'up to 30' - not giving an accurate count, perhaps due to difficulty identifying who was a civilian - according to the NYT article below, women began taking up arms against the raid) typical or avoidable? How often do our service members die in raids such as this? Is there any history of Presidents ordering such operations and not being present in the situation room - is this a departure from typical norms? Is the posting of old video by the military an attempt to control the PR situation regarding the raid?

This NYT article is perhaps more neutral, discussing the details of the raid:
