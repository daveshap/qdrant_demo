Moving Out.
Good Morning Reddit,

I am a 18 year old young man, soon to be 19 and i am thinking about moving out of the house. My father has up to now been paying for everything for me besides gas (Food, Insurance, Phone etc.). But he gets very  harsh sometimes, and I have been talking about moving out. I work in the technology industry for Cisco making 10$ an hour until i can get some certifications. Right now i have lined up around a 1000$ apartment with three friends of mine all with stable incomes who i have known since grade school. After adding up all other costs to live i picture it to be about 1100$ to 1300$ a month to get by which leaves me with about 400 or 500$ a month extra. Right now i am finishing up my first year in college but I'm not doing the best because i also work at McDonald's -_- in total i push around 60 hours a week and every time they offer help at my school it's always at inconvenient times. Also i spend around 400$ a month right now in gas, which is another reason I'd like to move because the apartment will be within biking distance to both my office and McDonald's. Basically i think I'll be able to survive without going under an living paycheck to paycheck. Does anyone have any experience or advice into this subject? 

Thank you,

Brian
