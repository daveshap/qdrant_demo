GEORGE: Well, hello to you, darlin'.
ERIN: What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
GEORGE: Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
ERIN: Well, I'm the neighbors. There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
GEORGE: Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different. Let's start over. My name's George. What's yours?
ERIN: Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
GEORGE: Now, don't be like that. Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?
