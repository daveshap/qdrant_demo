Am I cheating? I don’t know really what I want but I need to talk to the girl and tell her, basically it’s all in here, I’m just really unsure of myself.
Am I a cheater? I don’t know how to explain to this girl that I still want to be with her.

So, I’m 15, I was talking to this girl, who I go to school with, same grade, We’re in highschool, we Aren’t dating, we’ve both made that clear but we still spend time together and kiss, but don’t hug or hold hands weirdly enough, I try but, she doesn’t seem to want really to show that kind of affection. But anyways she loves to go through my phone and today, she decided to go through my Snapchat, and found I was talking to some other girl who doesn’t go to our school, but is an old friend who I started to have interest in because we’re super alike, our birthdays are a week apart and we just have tons of fun talking, we both have interest in dating each other aswell. And she(the girl who goes to my school) went through my phone and saw it, she showed me, was visibly upset, and now won’t talk to me, I don’t know what to do because I like her, I care about her, but I need to get her to talk to me in order to tell her that we have different viewpoints on a relationship, I love being with who I’m with and hold hands and hug I like average couple stuff, but she doesn’t, she doesn’t like to hug and doesn’t really like to be seen with me much. I don’t even really know if I want to stay with her honestly but both of our friend groups are intertwined and, this will definitely just, create a ripple affect because I was scared to say what I wanted. I basically need advice on what to say to her, I’m lost right now. We aren’t dating, but is it still cheating? I’ve never cheated or been in a situation like this so I honestly don’t know what to do. Thanks in advance.
