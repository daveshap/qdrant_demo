Does online dating and social media make anyone else real depressed?
I know it's not real life

but i go on tinder and see so many unatainable beautiful women then go on instagram and see more of the same but also really good looking guys who owuld have no problem getting these kind of girls. Kind of makes me feel shit about myself and depressed
