Men who don’t want commitment: what makes you go out of your way for a fwb/hookup?
I really want the guys perspective on this: if you know you’re not looking for a relationship, what makes you do (relationship) things that you know isn’t necessary for a hookup/fwb? 

For example: cooking food, always wants to hold hands/touching, cuddling, random kisses, remembering small details you’ve mentioned once when you guys are doing things etc. 

Is it for the sake of doing it, respect/courtesy? What makes you think it’s not you sending mixed signals? 

And ladies: would you rather your hookup/fwb not do all these extra things because it does cross between relationship/hookup boundaries or you don’t mind?
