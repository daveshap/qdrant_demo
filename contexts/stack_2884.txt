How can depletion region be formed at the center? Let's consider an electron at the junction in the n-type region. As it moves into the p-type we say it leaves behind a positive ion and hence in this way electrons at the junction in the n-type create a positive space charge region. But as an electron (at the junction) moves into the p-type, its position would be occupied by another electron waiting at the back (because all the electrons are in random motion). So if we see in this way ultimately a positive space charge would be developed at the surface of the n region.so whats wrong with my understanding?
