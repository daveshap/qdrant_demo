KIRK: Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
DECKER: Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
KIRK: Then you acted properly, of course.
DECKER: Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
KIRK: You saved the ship.
DECKER: I'm aware of that, sir.
KIRK: Stop competing with me, Decker!
DECKER: Permission to speak freely, sir?
KIRK: Granted.
DECKER: Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
KIRK: I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
DECKER: Yes, sir, I'll do that.
