ROSE: You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
NICK: You're over reacting!
ROSE: Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
NICK: MOM!
ROSE: You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
VADA: It's not his fault!
NICK: No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
ROSE: Go to your room. And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
VADA: Not exactly.
ROSE: Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
SAM: Good morning.
ROSE: Well maybe for you.
SAM: Something wrong?
ROSE: Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
SAM: Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
ROSE: Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
SAM: You couldn't?
ROSE: Well I'm sort of involved.
SAM: Sort of?
ROSE: Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
SAM: Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
ROSE: Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
SAM: All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
ROSE: Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
SAM: Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
PHIL: Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
SAM: Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
