DAWN: You too.
PILOT: You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes! Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
BARNES: The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
BARNES: This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
PILOT: Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
BARNES: Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now. I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
CARLO: It's getting hard to breathe...
JACK: Just don't move around too much.
