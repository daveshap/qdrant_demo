ALMA: This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
WADE: What is the Northcountry Development Association?
ALMA: I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
WADE: Twombley involved?
ALMA: No.
WADE: He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
ALMA: All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
