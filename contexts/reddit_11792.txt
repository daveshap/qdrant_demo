In 3rd year college and also 18 (M). Still single?
I never had the courage to ask a girl out or where to even start. I'm very open and can make small talk with any people easily but I just can't think of myself having the courage to ask a girl. I get along with all of the girls in class but my fear is that when if i asked someone out and refused, It will get awkward and I never liked that. 

I think I'm going to be single for the rest of my life if I keep doing this.
