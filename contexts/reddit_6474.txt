Why do companies keep job postings open for so long?
For example what would be the purpose in keeping an advert up for several weeks or even months?

Letâ€™s say you had a strong candidate apply in the first 1-2 weeks, if you keep the process open for several weeks or months then you risk losing that person.

Why do companies keep and repost positions for weeks or months?

Is it to get a large or strong enough pool to choose from?

To reach a certain applicant count?

Or have they simply not found what they were looking for? Hence they keep the position open until they get the unicorn or perfect resume.
