A question about a Master's thesis topic...
Background: I have an education in Psychology, however, have always enjoyed literature at it's core. I almost picked up a minor in university, if it wasn't for lack of funding. The following questions pertain to a researched based master's degree.

Please let this be known, I'm doing this just out of self-interest. I've been wondering if it would be acceptable to analyze an author's works under the view of a psychological perspective and the adaptations to the 21st century. This is just one of my ideas, mind you. My main concern is if the bulk of the paper becomes more psychological than literature based, would this still be acceptable at the given level?

Kind thoughts appreciated, let's keep this positive!
