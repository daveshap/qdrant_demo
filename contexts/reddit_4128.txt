Bumble in a nutshell.
I know these compilations have been made before, but I just wanted to make my own. I've used Tinder and OKCupid in the past. I'll soon be deleting Bumble. 

The sample is overwhelmingly White women. I am not White. I am looking for a long-term relationship. I have not had success in any capacity. Often times, the profile will have no bio at all. In those cases, I swipe left mechanically. I live a good distance away from Chicago.

1. Some variation of "Don't really know what I'm on here for" or "My friend made me do this"
2. Some variation of "The Office is my favorite show!" or "I quote too much from The Office"
3. "Sydney - New York - Chicago"
4. Some variation of "I love traveling" or "Wanderlust"
5. "420"
6. "Just here for the free food"
7. "Looking for a +1 to my cousin's wedding"
8. "Margaritas and tacos"
9. Some variation of "Dog mom" or "Chances are I'll like your dog better than you"
10. "Actually, I'm 19. Bumble keeps saying I'm 23"
11. "UW - Madison"
12. "Just looking for the Jim to my Pam"
13. Some variation of "Love being outdoors" or "Looking for my next adventure"
14. "Fluent in sarcasm"
15. "nOt LoOkInG fOr HoOkUpS"
16. "Talk \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to me"
17. "Trying to find someone who looks at me the same way that I look at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"
18.  "IG - \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" "SC - \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"
19. "Couple - just looking for a 3rd"
20. Some cryptic quote like "When the sunsets on love, the moon rises with indifference" or some bullshit.

The quote that pretty much surmised my feelings toward this whole thing came from a Black woman on the app and it nails the head perfectly on this dating coffin:

"*Everyone seems to love The Office. I mean I get it, but wow, is it possible to find genuine human connection on here?"* 

I’m going to continue the list with a few additions that other redditors suggested. I’ll also give them credit for their suggestions. Thank you to everyone who commented and/or threw more ideas out there. I hope everyone finds someone special for the coming year.
