Exclusion from group
I'm going hiking to earn a DofE award. There are 2 groups. I have already done a practice with one group. Now someone else is doing the award. This means that 1 out of the 5 people in the original group have to leave and join a new one instead.

The reason I don't want to move is because the new person joining is highly irritating. We are all aware of this. The rest of the group are supposedly good friends and don't want to do it without each other.

To give everyone a fair chance there was an 'informal' name out of the hat type-thing to decide originally. It was my name pulled out. As it turns out the teacher wasn't aware of this so he did his own one that pulled out another person's name - Darren. The reason that the rest of my group didn't tell this teacher that it was already sorted was because Darren felt bad for me as an outcast.

So now Darren is supposed to leave but is trying to push me out. His reasoning is strong to be honest. The rest of the group don't want me there and resent me for not moving. Apparently its a '3 man group' out of 4 with me there.

Sorry that was long, I just really would like to know, what would you do if you were in my shoes? Thank you :)
