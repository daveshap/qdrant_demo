I am an incredibly ungrateful child.
So, I'm probably a terrible person. I'm 15, and I've been routinely stealing money for my parents, for no better reason other than 'I want sweets' and 'I just want money'. My mother found out, and she came and talked to me the most upset she's ever been. I'm extremely disrespectful to my parents; I ignore them and stay in my room when I come home from school, and I know that I am incredibly up myself in terms of I think I know everything. and the worst thing is, though their parental methods have maybe been a bit harsh (sometimes being gently hit, yelled at a lot), they don't really deserve it. They really do a lot for me, pay money for me to go to an expensive school and go on extra curricular programs and what-not even though my mother revealed that we are apparently not as well off as I believed. 

What I need to know is this:
a) How I can fix my relationship with my parents
b) Stop habitually stealing from them,
c) Generally fix above mentioned personality flaws.

Thanks everyone.
