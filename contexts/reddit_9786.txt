Are SAHE programs hard to get into
Hey all! I'm applying this fall to SAHE programs and I'm starting to get a little concerned if I'm actually going to get in. Are programs hard to be accepted by? I'm applying to at least 5 schools now and I'm unsure If I should add more. I have a pretty good undergrad GPA and GRE scores and will have good essays and recommendations. I'm only applying to programs with essentially guaranteed assistantships and tuition remission so would just love some insight from those that have gone through this before. Thanks!
