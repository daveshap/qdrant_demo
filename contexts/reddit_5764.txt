Searching for 6 months, no contact from employers
A friend of mine has been searching for a job in a new area (medium city) for about 6 months. She's applied \~300 jobs that she was at least partially qualified for, and many that were "perfect fits". She has 5 years of experience in her area. She's gotten expert (in and out of her field) advice on her resume and cover letters, she's tailoring her resume to each job to get by ATS, she's adding as many people related to the jobs she's applying for on Linked in as she can find (with no response), she's been to the local job center, and she's gone to networking events for her field.

She hasn't gotten a single callback or interview in all that time.

At this point she's desperate. Are there any guaranteed jobs someone with a B.S. can get?
