What block is the slowest to break with pickaxe? All the entries in the wiki etc focus on breaking speed of blocks using 'the right tool', and I couldn't find anything about breaking blocks with 'wrong tool'. And I'm wondering what is the slowest block to mine with pickaxe obtainable legally in survival.My last concrete making session ended up with a big hole in the 'concrete maker' as I was afk'ing using my diamond pickaxe (with mending enchantment) and missed the moment concrete ran out. Within range of a beacon set to Haste 2, the pickaxe chewed through the obsidian back of the concrete maker in matter of moments and proceeded to punch a hole in the wall of my super-smelter that happened to be behind that wall. Are there any other materials more resistant to pickaxe than obsidian? I mean, at this point it seems like wool takes longer, but I'm not sure. I'm almost feeling like putting a nametagged zombie behind the obsidian, that would take a while to break with a pick.
