Am I the only one who likes to know someone before sex?
22M here, I feel weird and alienated from my peers cause I actually like to feel a personal attraction to someone before jumping in the sack with them, not just a physical one. In fact most of the time my body won’t get revved up until I feel safe and trust my partner. My bar for attraction is pretty high too, I like partners who are smart, ambitious, talented, philosophical, etc. which makes it hard to start relationships when most people I know are more appearance/“sex appeal” oriented in their relationships. Thoughts? Tips?
