Is it okay for a company to threaten someone during an interview? True story.
Is it okay for a company to threaten someone during an interview? True story. Manager at said company (happens to be in Silicon Valley) threatened to so called reveal information about an interviewee. Said strategy badly backfired because interviewee brought in a small army of supporters and kicked manager's ass. Idiotic, idiotic, idiotic. Idiotic what people seem to put up with from managers in companies. Is this the future of work?
