MUMFORD: Painful lymph glands? Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
SOFIE: Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
MUMFORD: Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
SOFIE: Where?
MUMFORD: Life.
SOFIE: I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
MUMFORD: Did you get headaches before this? But you get more now? Or more severe?
SOFIE: No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
MUMFORD: So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
MUMFORD: I can give myself a headache instantly.
SOFIE: Is that like a party trick?
MUMFORD: All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
MUMFORD: There... I've given myself a real whopper.
SOFIE: You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts? So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
MUMFORD: Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
SOFIE: Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
