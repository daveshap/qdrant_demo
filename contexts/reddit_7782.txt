My M.S. Advisor let me Defend When I wasn't Ready, and I Failed
tl;dr. Lost funding; threw a hail-mary to defend before funding ran out; failed. Still don't think I should've been allowed to defend. 

So a bit of background: my relationship with my advisor sucks. He convinced me to switch projects from one with a working code to one with a broken code without telling me the code was broken. So, instead of generating results and trying to develop a new method, I tried to debug thousands of lines of C++ CFD code, unsuccessfully, for about 7 months.

After failing to fix his code, he informed me in my third semester that he was hesitant to keep funding me, and that I would need to improve my work ethic. I think the debugging with no results had burned me out completely at this point.

Finally, I propose a new approach to fixing his code that he still doesn't particularly like, and yet it answered some important questions on how to move forward. 

He informs me that he cannot fund me past two years. Okay, fine. I'll try to defend before that.

He informs me halfway through the Spring semester that I should defend in May. Great! Hopefully I can get it done in time; if not, I'll have to pay my own tuition to defend.

Well, the deadline comes up and he tells me a "sensible" draft of my thesis should be fine. We meet remotely for the defense, and I fail.

I totally get that I'm responsible for this chain of events, but damn did I get very little practical guidance in how to proceed. This has been the worst experience of my life, and I want to give up after working so hard on a thesis, then flunking the defense. I just don't understand how an advisor with my best interest at heart would let me defend and fail.

Now I must wait at least 3 months to defend again, so a summer defense is not an option. It's looking like another semester or two to finish my degree.
