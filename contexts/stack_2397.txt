How can you play the same game with different accounts from the same folder? I'd like to keep all my games on a different computer and the folder with the games then just gets mounted on Windows via iSCS or NFS.  This certainly works for one PC using the folder. But I'd like to use more than one PC to e.g. play the same game with friends at the same time. Everyone would use his own account but I don't know if there will be any issues when reading and in particular writing to the same drive.Most important stuff seems to get synced into the cloud anyways for common and recent games. I don't if games generally do a lot of writing to the program folder beyond saving the files.I mostly have games from Steam, UPlay, Origin and EpicGames in mind.
