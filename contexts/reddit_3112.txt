Jobs that let you be active/be in nature? Would it help my depression?
I burned out on teaching and am battling really bad depression atm. I’m looking to start working again soon, something part time. I think moving around or being in nature would really help me, as I have a lot of trouble just getting up and going for a walk and gyms make me anxious. If I could get outside or move around as a job, it may help. Not just standing around, like retail or teaching - I’ve been on my feet all day in those jobs and I hurt at the end of the day. 


However, I have no experience with these types of jobs... idk what to do. I want try something different while I work on my health, I think it would be beneficial. 


Any advice?
