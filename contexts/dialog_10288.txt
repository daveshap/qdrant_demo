GWEN: So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
JASON: Right.
GWEN: Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
JASON: No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
