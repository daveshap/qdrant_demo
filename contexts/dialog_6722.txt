LI: I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
YU: But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
LI: True. But I must borrow it for one last mission. Jade Fox must die at its edge. Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
YU: My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone. I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
LI: You did your job well. But, this girl... I saw her last night.
YU: I knew she would intrigue you.
LI: She needs direction... and training.
YU: She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us. In any case, it will all be over soon. You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
LI: That's not for her. She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
YU: But Wudan does not accept women.
LI: For her, they might make an exception. If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
YU: It's not our affair. Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
LI: I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
YU: I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
LI: Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
JEN: Lo?
LO: Jen!
JEN: You shouldn't have come.
LO: With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here. I can't wait any longer. I was wrong to let you go. Come back with me. You'll be happy in the desert. You'll be free there.
