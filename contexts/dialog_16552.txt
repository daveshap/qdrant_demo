LOVETT: I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
BARNARD: I see.
LOVETT: I see.
BARNARD: Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
LOVETT: I'm never conversational before I coffee.
BARNARD: Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
LOVETT: Why, of course. Yes.
BARNARD: Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
LOVETT: That's ridiculous.
BARNARD: Is it?
LOVETT: It certainly is.
BARNARD: Look here—
LOVETT: Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
BARNARD: I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
LOVETT: Oh, really?
BARNARD: Yes.
LOVETT: Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is— What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
BARNARD: Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
LOVETT: Now you're irritating and absurd!
