GEORGIE: Where's the ads"?! The ads are in Alabama
ED: Why not??
GEORGIE: Because I can't sell it to save my life! You made a goddamn feathered fish. Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick? Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
ED: Maybe it needs special handling.
GEORGIE: Screw you, Wood! I even sunk more money into different titles: Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit."
ED: You can't talk that way about my movie.
GEORGIE: Your movie"?! I wish it was your movie! I wish I hadn't blown every dime I ever made into this stinkbomb. If I ever see you again
BUNNY: So guess where I'm going next weekend?
ED: I don't know. Where?
BUNNY: Mexico! And guess what I'm going to do there?!
ED: I dunno. Lie on the beach?
BUNNY: WRONG! I'm getting my first series of hormone shots! And once those babies kick in, they're gonna remove my organs, and MAKE ME A WOMAN!
ED: Jesus! Are you serious?
BUNNY: Yes! I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action. GOODBYE, PENIS!
