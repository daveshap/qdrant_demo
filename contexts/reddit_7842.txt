For the grad students at Universities going online until further notice (and possibly closing down campus), how has it affected your lab and research?
My school is going online effective immediately, and has told students they have the next week and a half to move out of the dorms. I am trying to gauge what this could mean for my research since it requires physical time in the lab.
