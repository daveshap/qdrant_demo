I really like a girl but i don't know what to do
So there's this girl ive known for years shes so sweet funny a total joy to be around and so beutiful I sometimes just get lost in her eyes when we make eye contact. I want to make her the happiest girl around and pick her up when she's felling low and put her before me and give her all the love she deserves even though I'm not sure its humanly possible to give her all the love she deserves.
And I love making her smile. She has such a pretty smile. I want to hold her in my arms underneath the light of every star in the sky and make her feel like the luckiest girl in the world.
She is so amazing it's hard to do her justice just typing it out but I really think I could make her so happy given the chance and I'm hoping you glorious people can help me out I don't know how to get this amazing girl.
