Visualize categorical data for two variables for 20 observations I have several thousand records. In these records, there are three fields of interest:Location - 20 possible choicesRace - 5 possible choicesPurchase type - 3 possible choicesI want to show the count of the possible combinations for each location on a single graphic. For example, Location 1 will have 15 possible choices (three purchase types for each of the five race choices) and the first choice might be a count of 23 observations for (1) Citytown (2) Black (3) New Purchase. The next data point could be 14 observations of (1) Citytown (2) Black (3) Rehabbed Purchase. And so on and so forth.I realize this is 300 points to put on a graphic which may be asking a lot.How can I put all of this information on a single graphic?
