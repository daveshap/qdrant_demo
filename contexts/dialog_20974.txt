O'BRIEN: I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell. I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly. Exciting stuff. I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
SUSAN: I guess I should be flattered.
O'BRIEN: I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
SUSAN: It already is.
O'BRIEN: I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
SUSAN: And for cleaning up oil spills.
O'BRIEN: Right. You predicted it.
O'BRIEN: Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
SUSAN: It was a long time ago, Daniel. We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
O'BRIEN: Yeah.
SUSAN: Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
O'BRIEN: Sure. Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while. How come?
SUSAN: Nothing really worthwhile.
O'BRIEN: That's what I thought.
