I'm addicted to the idea of not existing anymore
It makes me feel calm, it makes me remember that, eventually, it will all end. See, I've been thinking about suicide since I was 15/16, I'm 26 and this is part of me. I'm bipolar, I have so many demons inside my head, even with meds and therapy, sometimes it's unbearable and then I start a travel inside my mind, where I think about the idea of not existing, I won't be here. The pain, the traumas, I'll become just a memory...But I also have to leave the good things behind, like my favorite music, movie, my cats...It hurts, it's like I'm running out of air for years, suicide is there, it is an option, the final one...At the end of the day I just want to quiet my mind, that's all I need.

Sorry, just needed to write about this...and I think this is a safe place.

Edit: I'm glad some people can relate to this, we'll be okay, eventually. One day this will all end and we won't need to use suicide as an exit. Always remember that.
