BOOTH: We're dead. We're dead, We are dead... What are we going to do?!
EARL: I don't know...
BOOTH: This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
EARL: I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?! We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
BOOTH: That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.
EARL: Well, we didn't know that at the time.
BOOTH: We assaulted a Federal agent. We killed him.
EARL: No we didn't. He died on his own.
BOOTH: Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl. I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
BOOTH: We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
EARL: Are you nuts? They'll fry us for sure. There's no way we're doin' that, you understand? No way.
BOOTH: It's the right thing to do.
EARL: It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
BOOTH: I should have known something like this was going to happen!
EARL: Man take it easy! You're sweating like crazy!
