I'm currently in the military, I get out in a couple years, what can I do between now and then to set myself up for success when I become a civilian?
Once I get out, I'll get to use my GI bill, but I would also like to make >$15 per hour to supplement it. I worked as a beginning machinist while in high school, but decided to pursue a medical job in the military. I have no interest in medicine once I become a civilian, and would like to get back into fabrication or a trade. My issue is that I spend too much time away from home to have any chance at being successful in a classroom, and most trades require hands on training. I'm seeking advice on what I should do in my limited free time for the next few years in the military, to he able to smoothly transition to a civilian job afterwards. Thanks in advance.
