Create multiple paths by joining a set of start points in one layer to a single end destination in another layer? I need to create a batch of paths so that I can calculate the best potential placement of a development site by counting the number of intersecting features along that path. I have a grid of points in one layer and a single point in another. I would like to create a line for each of the features in the start layer to the single point in the other layer.Most of points to line features only take one layer as an input or either take two layers with a single feature.QGIS on MacOS El CapIs there a possible solution to this?
