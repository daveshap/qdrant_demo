Guys, let’s make our own a2c alumni
I just saw that post about there is a high chance some people in this sub will go on and do great things in the future, so that got me thinking. What if we made a pact right now to help each other out in the future, like alumni. In 10 years where everyone is pretty much set in their life, and you find yourself going to a job interview, just try to work in the words “a2c sub” somewhere. If one of you guys hear that, just give the guy the job ya’know.
