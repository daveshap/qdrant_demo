So, I'm sick (throwing up and the work) and being threatened to be written up at work
Alright, so pretty much. I work at a doggy day care and I woke up at 2am throwing up with violent chest pain and throwing up. I immediately texted my store manager and shift manager and got no response from the store manager, but I got a text from the shitty shift manager saying that I'm burdening her with figuring out how to cover a shift with 6 hours of time before my shift. 

I was then told that I was going to be written up because I made the shift manager go through the process of figuring out coverage for me. (My work has two locations and mine has 3 employees including me, stupid I know. So they had to pull someone from the other location) 

Also, written on our schedules it says at the bottom, if you have a medical emergency (I believe a contagious flu is...) Please contact the store manager and the shift manager for us to cover your shift.

Help...?
