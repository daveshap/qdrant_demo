DUNWITTY: Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass. They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air. Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows. We're on in 3 weeks. Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
DUNWITTY: They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
DELACROIX: This has to be a big mistake.
DUNWITTY: The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier. From the gitgo, from jump street.
DELACROIX: Hold on a sec, I got a call.
DELACROIX: Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
DELACROIX: I gots to go, it's my Moms.
DUNWITTY: I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news. I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
ORCHID: Peerless, your father called.
DELACROIX: I'll be right over.
MANTAN: So what's up with you?
SLOAN: What do you want to know?
MANTAN: The good stuff.
SLOAN: I'm an asthmatic. Been one all my life. Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
MANTAN: What else?
SLOAN: Are you trying to rap to me?
ORCHID: He wants you to come and see him.
DELACROIX: He said that?
ORCHID: Yes he did.
DELACROIX: Where is he?
ORCHID: He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
DELACROIX: I can't go all the way down south.
ORCHID: Richmond is not all the way down south.
DELACROIX: I don't even know why you're still concerned over him. Daddy's not with you.
ORCHID: Regardless, he still is your father.
DELACROIX: It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
ORCHID: Even more reason to see him. He'll be overjoyed with your success.
DELACROIX: C'mon, Mommy. Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done. From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
ORCHID: Peerless, last time, go see your father.
