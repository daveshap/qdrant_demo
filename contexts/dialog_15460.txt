TED: Salisbury steak.
BILLY: I hate it.
TED: You don't hate it. We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
BILLY: No I didn't. I hate the brown stuff. It's gross.
TED: All it is is onions and gravy.
BILLY: I'm allergic to onions.
TED: You are not allergic of onions.
BILLY: I want a pizza.
TED: No. This is fine. Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
BILLY: I think I'm going to throw up.
TED: Oh, for God's sake...Here.
TED: There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
BILLY: Some of the brown stuff is still there.
TED: Then eat around it.
BILLY: No.
TED: Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
BILLY: I don't care. I hate it. I want pizza.
TED: Not on your life. That's it. I've had it with crap around this house. From now on, no more pizza! Get it? Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
BILLY: No!
