NURSE: Your mother, and your father
VIOLA: From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
NURSE: He looks well enough for a mountebank.
VIOLA: Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
NURSE: My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
VIOLA: You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
