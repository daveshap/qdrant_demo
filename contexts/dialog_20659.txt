PEGGY: I closed my Christmas club.
MR. KELCHER: Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
PEGGY: I wanted to apologize for this morning.
MR. KELCHER: It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen. Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
PEGGY: Quiet today?
MR. KELCHER: This morning was good.
PEGGY: The hat business is in trouble.
MR. KELCHER: I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
PEGGY: Yes.
MR. KELCHER: That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
PEGGY: But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
MR. KELCHER: Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
PEGGY: He'll win.
MR. KELCHER: Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
NANCY: You think this'll cheer Dad up?
PEGGY: Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
MR. KELCHER: I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -â€”how could you do that?
MRS. KELCHER: Please don't shout.
