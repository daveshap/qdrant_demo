The girl I love broke it off with me..
We're still friends and we talk a lot, but no matter how hard I try I want to be near her, I want to be in her arms.. She was the first girl I dated and it was for a year and a half. The only thing that keeps me so attached is the way she knew me like no one else. While we were together I changed.. I became depressed and angry and I still have fits of rage where I just want to hurt someone.. And she'd always hold me and she just knew me.. and i can never have her that way again.. i dont know what to do and its killing me.. its literally killing me
