\"cultivate\" means making a lot of effort I have found out in Cambridge dictionary that, cultivate means making a lot of effort. But I cannot find any nice example for that. Could anyone please provide me an example? Here is my attempt at using the word with this meaning: \"I've been cultivating to increase my knowledge for several years.\" Is it wrong?
