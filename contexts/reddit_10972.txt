My friend who committed suicide is getting no life recognition and it is pissing me off
I am off and on suicidal and for the first time in my life, someone I know killed himself. He was a high school friend of my boyfriend's, we didn't see each other too often but when we did we always had a blast. He was the kind of guy who would literally do anything for you. I wasn't the closest to him but if I needed him he would've driven the 4+ hours away he lived from me to come help. 

He had the biggest heart.

Now he is dead at 27. Nobody is talking about it on his facebook (he only had 70~ facebook friends, but that's the kind of guy he was). 

His closest friends were my boyfriend and two of my boyfriends other friends. His funeral is on Sunday on the 31st but he doesn't get a proper funeral. There is no burial. I am pretty sure the extent of his death being honoured will be it mentioned on mass on the 31st, but not with a single brochure. 

HE WAS AN AMAZING PERSON. Literally one of the kindest hearts, and he is barely getting acknowledged and it is driving me nuts. I know that those who loved him and were close to him are acknowledging him in their hearts everyday but it is just pissing me off that nobody is talking about him.

He was thrown too much shit in life and was not given the chance to flourish. 

I just wanted to let the world know that they lost someone really amazing this month.
