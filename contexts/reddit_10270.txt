I'm quite convinced that depression will kill me someday, and I'm okay with that.
Until that day comes, however, I can only do my best. Even if that means wallowing in existential dread, failing at everything, losing all meaningful connections and watching the world hustle away while I sink into the void, it is okay :)


Everything is okay.
