BEN: No.
JACKIE: Pray. We never find out.
RACHEL: Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
STACY: Does Jackie know this?
RACHEL: No. I'm doing it behind her back.
STACY: In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
RACHEL: Something came up. C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
STACY: Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
