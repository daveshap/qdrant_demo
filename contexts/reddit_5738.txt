Job Relevancy - Employment Hunt
Greetings. I have family member who is currently unemployed and I wanted to help them find a new job. My question is what type of occupations are suitably relevant to apply for with over twelve years of experience as a former Director of disability services. Like would anything oriented around administration and management in the medical industry work or does it have to be specific? I'm a simple college student without much knowledge of how the work force operates so any and all insight would be greatly appreciated involving this subject matter. Thanks.
