Dating is so fckn complicated! Stop taking people for granted! Let them know what you really want!
So you dated this person. You liked her or him. You always hang out. Dinner, coffee, talk, sex, enjoy life. But then you don't know where you place yourself. Because you both are so complicated! You want to keep each other's company but don't ask for any assurance or validation if they are gonna stay or what. Because you're scared that if you ask them they might run away. Scared of commitments, scared of another broken promises, another mistake. 

Dating is fucking complicated. You want love or no, companion, lover or friend, friends with benefit perhaps?  You want to give your all,but you keep on hesitating. 

The thing is, in the end what we really craving is love. Admit it, we are all lonely in this shitty world! Friends might help for a while, but we still crave for something. We need a lover.

We entered dating not just for sex. But to feel noticed, taken cared of, loved. Truly loved. To feel special. If this person started dating you, they need you as well like you needed them. Stop taking people for granted.
