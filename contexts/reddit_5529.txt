Information Technology Career Question
Hello All, 

Just to give a bit of background on my education experience. I have a BBA in Management Information Systems, and I'm working on my MS in Cyber Security and Information Assurance. Also, I'm slated to take my CompTIA Security+ test next month. 

For my work experience, I've been working helpdesk for about two years doing Tier 1-Tier3 work. This is due to my IT group being a small entity so the responsibilities are many. While in college I worked as a Network Technician for 4.5 years, taking care of connections and installing infrastructure devices such as UPS's, AP's, and the occasional switch. Also, terminating connections and patching in new ones, very basic stuff. 

I'd eventually like to get into the cybersecurity realm, but I'd like to know a good place to start? There is absolutely no opportunity where I work for upward movement, everyone is riding out their careers, and there isn't any inkling of a new position being created. For example, it took the most recent admin 9 years to get off of the helpdesk. My management is standoffish about me asking anything in regards to career advancement. Can anyone give me some advice? Thank you in advance!!
