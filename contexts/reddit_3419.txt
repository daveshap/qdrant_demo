Would people be interested in a blind dating app where you match based on real time voice conversations, rather than just pictures?
Hi all! I've been spending this quarantine working on a dating app that flips the script on traditional dating appsâ€“instead of filtering first on pictures, the app I've made matches based on real time voice conversations that you have with your dates. After you match, you can continue the conversation and once you feel more comfortable with your partner, you can reveal your profiles. Some of my family and friends have described it as the Netflix show "Love is Blind" in app form.

The app is actually out and ready, but I don't want to drop the name of the app here without the moderator's approval. If you're interested, DM me and I can send you a link (or if you're a mod, I would really appreciate approval). I feel like a lot of posts that I've read here are related to traditional dating app fatigue and this is definitely a very different app! It really does feel more fun to use than just swiping. Would love to know your thoughts and hope you're having a wonderful weekend!
