Should repeated words after an ellipsis be capitalized? I've searched everywhere, including questions about whether to capitalize after a stutter (no), capitalize after an ellipsis (no if it's a continuation of a sentence, yes if it's a new sentence), but they don't really answer my question exactly.Let's say I have this line of dialogue \"What... what happened?!\"Should the second \"what\" be capitalized? Technically, it's a full sentence by itself, but it's also a repetition of the previous \"What.\" So should it be capitalized?
