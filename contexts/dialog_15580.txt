MAO TSE TUNG: Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
TENZIN GYATSO: I leave tomorrow.
MAO TSE TUNG: Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
TENZIN GYATSO: I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
MAO TSE TUNG: You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
TENZIN GYATSO: Always.
