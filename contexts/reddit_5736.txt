I don't know how to move on from my unemployment
I recently graduated from a Psychology undergrad in July and was so excited and motivated to get into the job world. I quickly got a job as a Support Worker and my initial plan was to have this job for maybe a year in order to gain experience working with people with mental health experiences. A week in this changed to 6 months and then I quit 5 months later (it was less than 5 months but lets pretend its 5). 

So that was a month ago and, I don't know what I'm doing. It sounds silly but I feel almost...too scared to go back to work? I would go into work with so much anxiety because of my coworkers and now I'm scared because I fear that'll happen again. Not only do I not know what I want to do now, I definitely don't want another Healthcare Worker role, but I just don't want to get another job. 

I've applied here and there to places because I know I \*NEED\* a job but I think I'm so scared of being stuck in a place where I'm getting constant anxiety attacks that I'm not really trying. Like I was scheduled to have a phone interview today for a Lab Technician (a job I know I would have died to have) and I just didn't pick up the phone because my heart was racing and I was too scared. 

How do I get over this fear?

And bonus question, how do you figure out what you want to do? I want a job where I'm not dreading going in everyday and I'm starting to think that doesn't exist.
