BRUNO: Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know? Comin' off hard.
MAX: Yeah, sure, I understand.
BRUNO: I never woulda done it. Probably not, anyway. I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
MAX: Yeah?
BRUNO: You're attractive, you're smart. Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
MAX: Sooo...whattya think? Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date. Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
BRUNO: Man, you got a bad attitude.
MAX: I like to keep it professional, that's all.
BRUNO: Fine. So call her. Get her over here.
MAX: Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
BRUNO: What?
MAX: That's not why we're here.
BRUNO: What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
