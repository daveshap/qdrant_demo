DAWN: Taylor?
TAYLOR: Yeah?
DAWN: What do you think's going to happen to us?
TAYLOR: Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
DAWN: Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
TAYLOR: Do you want some advice?
DAWN: Sure.
TAYLOR: Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening. You'll live longer.
DAWN: Words to live by.
