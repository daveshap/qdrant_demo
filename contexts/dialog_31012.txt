MOM: You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
DAD: But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
MOM: Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
TED: I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
DAD: You ordered a Winnebago?
MOM: We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that."
DAD: We miss you. We miss our son.
MOM: We miss our family.
