Terminated From Current Job While In Final Interviews
So, I'm in an extremely weird situation right now.

Things have been quite shaky recently at my current (now-previous) job to the point it was becoming mentally overwhelming to come into work every day. In response to this I've been applying and interviewing for other jobs for just shy of a month now.

There's a job I'm currently gunning for in which I've made it past 3 phone interviews and was just notified I was selected to come in for a final interview. I'm fairly confident I can get this position, as I don't believe I have allot of competition. I was approached by a recruiter for this role and it doesn't appear that the company has it listed on any job boards / websites. I've also hit it off really well with everyone I've interviewed with on the phone, including the CRO of the company who would be the one making the final decision.

Now, here's my weird situation: I was still employed when I began the interview process for the job I'm trying to get, but when I came into work today I was pulled into the office and notified that I was being terminated from my position due to inconsistent performance and being a bad fit for the company. Admittedly, I'm pretty sure my job found out that I was applying and interviewing with other jobs as well.

How do I approach this? I want to do everything in my power to ensure this doesn't negatively impact my chances of getting this position in any way. Should I proactively bring this up? Should I only mention my sudden change in employment status if prompted?

Any advice would be appreciated!
