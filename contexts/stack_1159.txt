SQL Server 2008R2 database migration to cloud: case-insensitive collation changed to case-sensitive Recently felt the fall out (crappy legacy code base) of a database migration by a third party vendor where the collation was swapped from case-insensitive to case-sensitive. I am wondering if the collation was deliberately changed during the migration? I would have thought that in any database migration the collation would remain unchanged (i.e. stay the same as the source database collation). Does the server which the database is hosted automatically override the collation maybe?
