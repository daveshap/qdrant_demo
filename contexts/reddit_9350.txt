Maybe this can help you? My $40 coronavirus supplies for 3 weeks since the grocery is empty and I am poor
The store shelves near me were empty. But I've been broke and in a natural disaster before. Here's where I put my $40 remaining cash this week to prep for everything shutting down....

There was no toilet paper. I cannot afford a bidet.

So I got a bathroom sink-to-hose adapter from Lowes. It was $6.50. The hose was 99 cents from the 99 cent store. $7.49 and my bum will stay clean! The toilet is next to my sink in the bathroom, so it's no big to turn it on, DIY-bidet then wipe down with a washcloth. I will not be returning to toilet paper after this.

Which brings me to my other investment... $5 of ugly printed terrycloth from the fabric store. I've cut it into 30 butt-only-wipes. I haven't sewn it. Use pinking scissors and there won't be stray threads. Wash and reuse them whenever you want.

I also bought 10 pounds of flour for $8. I have plenty of seasonings, yeasts, everything else for bread.

I was gifted a case of wine from a now-cancelled work banquet. Big come up there! 

Finally, I bought $10 worth of ugly fruit from a farmers market. I'm redditing while slicing up about 30 pounds of misshapen, delicious fruit to stick in my dehydrator (purchased at goodwill for $5). Making jam tonight, made several sauces, I plan to juice and freeze the apples I can't bake right away.

I hope this helps someone else out there in our dystopian times.
