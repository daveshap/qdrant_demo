Sales and School
I’ve never really posted on Reddit. But after googling around I don’t know where else to turn. I’m just going to throw it all out there and hope you all pick up what I’m saying.

I graduated with a BAchelors Business Admin management emphasis.
While I was doing my degree I was working in business development. Basically I called people and scheduled appointments for sales people and got commission. 
I started selling cars after I finished my degree. 
I have always liked being in the dealership because it is fast paced, and a young guy like me can hit the ground and first year wind up close to 6 figures.
I love learning, and there’s only so much to learn selling cars alone.
A small part of me wants to go back for a masters but I really don’t know what I would do with it. I love selling, the hustle, the lack of time, setting and crushing goals. I love not just talking to people but influencing people’s decisions.
However, I like the bigger data, and one day I want to manage people. I realize I do like analytics, if decisions can change the outcome, and lead to success. I have looked into what I could do next, and a big part of me wants to go back for an MBA. My issue is then I’m back to entry level. I would like to go into a job I could start hustling at right away. What would that look like? Does such a job exist? I love my current job, and where I’m at. Just don’t want to look back and say I should have done “X”.
