LIEUTENANT: Okay -- book him and get him fixed up. Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
KLAATU: They would have killed this man?
LIEUTENANT: People get hysterical enough, they do anything. Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
KLAATU: How long will that take?
LIEUTENANT: They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital. Take him over to G2.
