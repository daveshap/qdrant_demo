HIROKO: Any luck raising Ackland's party?
KAMEN: Nothing. With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
HIROKO: First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
KAMEN: 'We'? You wanna fly out there with me?
HIROKO: Sure. Do me good to stretch my legs.
