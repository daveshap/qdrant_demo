AUSTIN: You seem surprised to see me.
ALOTTA: I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
AUSTIN: What, and watch all my earnings go... Down the toilet?
ALOTTA: What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
AUSTIN: Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta... Please?
ALOTTA: You may.
AUSTIN: Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
ALOTTA: Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
AUSTIN: I didn't, baby, you just told me.
ALOTTA: It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
AUSTIN: Behave!
ALOTTA: Come in.
AUSTIN: I'd rather talk about Number Two.
ALOTTA: Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
ALOTTA: May I wash you?
AUSTIN: Groovy.
ALOTTA: In Japan, men come first and women come second.
AUSTIN: Or sometimes not at all.
ALOTTA: Care for some saki?
AUSTIN: Sak-i it to me!
ALOTTA: How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
AUSTIN: Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
AUSTIN: 'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food. It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
ALOTTA: That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
AUSTIN: 'Milk, milk, lemonade. Round the corner fudge is made. Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
ALOTTA: Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
AUSTIN: To my health.
ALOTTA: Kiss me.
ALOTTA: Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
AUSTIN: Is it about my teeth?
ALOTTA: Yes.
AUSTIN: Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
ALOTTA: I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
AUSTIN: I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
ALOTTA: Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
DR. EVIL: Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
FRAU FARBISSINA: Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
DR. EVIL: Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
FRAU FARBISSINA: These are the latest word in android replicant technology. Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
DR. EVIL: Quite impressive.
FRAU FARBISSINA: Thank you, Herr Doctor.
DR. EVIL: I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
