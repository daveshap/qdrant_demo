MARTY: Is he cool or angry?
MAYOR: Well, these things happen. <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
WALT: So we just got lucky.

MARTY: And I need a drink.
WALT: If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape. How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
BOB: How could she turn on me like that? I thought she liked me.
WALT: Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
BOB: I'm ready!
MARTY: Stay ready. Stay by yourself in your room.
BOB: What'll I do for fun?
MARTY: Whyn't you learn your lines?
BOB: I <u>know</u> my lines...
WALT: You do...?
