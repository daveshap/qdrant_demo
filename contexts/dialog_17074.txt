DR. CHILTON: The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
GRAHAM: No.
DR. CHILTON: When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
GRAHAM: I want to see Lecktor now.
DR. CHILTON: Uh... sure...
LECKTOR: That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
GRAHAM: I keep getting it for Christmas.
LECKTOR: Did you get my card?
GRAHAM: I got it. Thank you.
LECKTOR: And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
GRAHAM: Stuart is fine.
LECKTOR: Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
GRAHAM: No.
LECKTOR: Of course, you don't. I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
GRAHAM: Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
LECKTOR: And?
GRAHAM: Very interesting, even to a layman.
LECKTOR: A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
GRAHAM: You've read the transcript. It's all there.
LECKTOR: No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
GRAHAM: It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
LECKTOR: It doesn't matter to me, Will.
GRAHAM: I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
LECKTOR: Yes, I thought so.
GRAHAM: It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
LECKTOR: Yes.
GRAHAM: You read about it, I'm sure.
LECKTOR: In the papers. I don't tear out the articles. I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
GRAHAM: I thought you would have some ideas.
LECKTOR: Why should I tell you?
GRAHAM: There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
LECKTOR: Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle. He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground. I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face. Never mind, it's boring.
GRAHAM: You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
LECKTOR: Pray tell.
GRAHAM: I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
LECKTOR: Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
GRAHAM: No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
LECKTOR: Then how did you catch me, Will?
GRAHAM: You had disadvantages.
LECKTOR: What disadvantage?
GRAHAM: You're insane.
LECKTOR: You're very tan, Will.
