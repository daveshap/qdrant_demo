PARRISH: Eddie?
SLOANE: Yeah - Bill - How are you? You okay?
PARRISH: Fine, fine. Big doing up here. Why are you still down here?
SLOANE: The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing. But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
PARRISH: Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over. Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
SLOANE: No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
PARRISH: If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
SLOANE: Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish. Talk to you Monday. Okay?
PARRISH: Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
ALLISON: Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
PARRISH: It's starting to grow on me. But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
ALLISON: The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar. The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian. Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
PARRISH: Do they, m'dear?
ALLISON: -- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room. I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
