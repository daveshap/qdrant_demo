RAPHAEL: Anybody know about that car outside?
ZAMMITO: Yeah. It's mine.
RAPHAEL: No. It's mine.
ZAMMITO: The hell it is.
RAPHAEL: I'm telling you that's my car! And someone's gonna pay for it!
ZAMMITO: And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
RAPHAEL: Fuck you, grease-ball!
ZAMMITO: Fuck me? Fuck you!
