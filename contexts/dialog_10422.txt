NATHANAEL GREENE: Colonel Washington? Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
WASHINGTON: Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
NATHANAEL GREENE: I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
WASHINGTON: It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene. Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
NATHANAEL GREENE: I was born with a limp, sir. The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...
WASHINGTON: But, you do come from a military family?
NATHANAEL GREENE: I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now. My father is an ironmaster. As was I.
WASHINGTON: A horseshoer?
NATHANAEL GREENE: Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history. And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal... Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
