What is the significance of this character being given a name? In Solo: A Star Wars Story, we witness<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   Han being given the name \"Solo\" during his application for Imperial flight training. More specifically, the officer asks Han who his \"people\" are, to which Han replies that he doesn't have any. The officer pauses, then decides to write down \"Solo\as though not having a \"people\" was out of the ordinary, and that he had to come up with something on the spot to enroll him.</blockquote>But considering the nature of the planet (tons of runaways, for example), I would have expected this to be a fairly common occurrence for people trying to \"get away\". Either enough for them to not require it, or at least have some default. Is being given a name in this fashion common, or is this the only time we see this happen in canon?
