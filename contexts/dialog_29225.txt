DAVIS: You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
GIDEON: I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
DAVIS: Not anymore, not in the city.
GIDEON: We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
DAVIS: Well, you just have to move further out.
GIDEON: Now how far would further out be?
DAVIS: I'm not here to argue, sir.
