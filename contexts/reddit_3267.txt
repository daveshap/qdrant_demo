How do I find a career I love?
Hi everyone! I graduated with a double major in Accounting and Management/Human Resources in 2015. After graduating I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do for sure, and ended up getting a job in public accounting primarily auditing. 

It’s now been over three years and I find myself asking myself how is this job making me grow and what drives me. I’ve concluded that it’s not helping me grow other than being more efficient in auditing and overall my drive is the large amount of work I have, not passion for what I do. Then I reflected on how I feel outside of work and basically I feel unfulfilled and am only happy when I’m on vacation/weekends. This brings me to my question, how does one find a career that gets them fired up and ready to go in the morning? I’m sick of having my motivation stem from ‘needing’ to do something rather than ‘wanting’ to do it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
