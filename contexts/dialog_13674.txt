JOE: You're in my head...
AL: Yes.
JOE: Your name is Al...
AL: Yes.
JOE: I see...
JOE: No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play... What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
AL: What is your name?
JOE: You're in my head? You don't know my name?
AL: I just got here.
JOE: What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
AL: Where are we?
JOE: Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
AL: What street?
JOE: What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
AL: Why don't we go home?
JOE: Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
AL: ...I need to make a phone call.
JOE: Do me a favor, Al.
AL: Yeah?
JOE: Shut up!
JOE: Somebody's been here.
AL: Where are we now?
JOE: My place, can't you see?
AL: No.
JOE: You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything.
AL: Right.
JOE: Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
AL: I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
JOE: Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
