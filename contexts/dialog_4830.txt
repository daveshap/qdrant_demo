FRANK: Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
MARY: I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up. I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
FRANK: Don't seem so bad to me.
MARY: Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that. Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
FRANK: Okay.
MARY: I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
FRANK: Maybe I should come up with you.
MARY: If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
FRANK: Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
MARY: No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
MARY: I shouldn't have asked you to come.
FRANK: You asked me not to come.
MARY: Promise you won't go inside.
FRANK: Fifteen minutes.
MARY: I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
FRANK: We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
MARY: Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
