VINCENT: Gimme your wallet.
MAX: Why?
VINCENT: I'll just hold onto it for you. In case they check.
MAX: In case <u>who</u> checks?
VINCENT: Our friends in Little Russia. Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
MAX: Dmitri?
VINCENT: The man who hired me for this contract.
MAX: I don't get it.
VINCENT: You're gonna be me. You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
MAX: Why me? Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
VINCENT: No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way. Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
MAX: He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
VINCENT: When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
MAX: No. No way. I can't do this.
VINCENT: Max. You threw my briefcase in the river. You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
MAX: I...I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
VINCENT: That's jazz, my friend. You said it yourself. So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes.
MAX: Vincent. Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
VINCENT: We've both run out of options. If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
MAX: How long have you been a hit man?
VINCENT: Why?
MAX: In case he asks.
VINCENT: Fifteen years, although I prefer the term assassin.""
MAX: You get benefits?
VINCENT: No.
MAX: Paid sick leave?
VINCENT: You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off. Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
