Suggestions on conductive materials for textile capacitive pressure sensors I am doing preliminary research for my thesis.  The thesis involves textile capacitive pressure sensors.  I am trying to find out more about how the type of conductive material used affects the capacitance of the sensors so I can better design my thesis.  The layer my research will focus on is actually the dielectric layer, but I need to decide on a consistent and reliable sensor design and am a bit overwhelmed by all my options for conductive materials (both in terms of metal and construction method of the material.  ie. thread, knitted fabric, woven fabric, etc).  Ideally I would just use conductive metal plates for the electrodes, but most likely I will have to make the electrodes out of conductive fabric and an integrative fabric.  Any good resources and/or personal experience with picking conductive materials for textile based capacitive pressure sensors would be great.  What metals are preferable?  I am new to the site, so if I need to be more specific with my question, please let me know.  Thanks in advance.**Edit:  I forgot to add that I am specifically measuring the impact of variations in the spacer material on the outcome of data collected by the sensor, in case that affects anyone's answers.
