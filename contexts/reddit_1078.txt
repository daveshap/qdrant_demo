Was suicidal with anxiety eight years ago...getting married on Saturday.
Eight years ago today I had had enough and sat on the sea wall at midnight about to throw myself in. Single, victim of DV, no full time job. I had terrible flashbacks, panic attacks, couldn't sleep. Now I'm still anxious but medication has helped enormously. I have a permanent full time job I love, a partner I love and I got to see my boys become fine young men. See your doctor.
