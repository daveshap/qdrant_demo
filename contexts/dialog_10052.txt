STEVE: Any particular reason?
ALICE: Just a feeling. Nothing personal.
STEVE: You want to leave?
ALICE: I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
STEVE: You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
ALICE: Next Friday.
STEVE: Thanks, Alice.
STEVE: I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
ALICE: Sure.
