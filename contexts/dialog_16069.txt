CLAUDE: Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
BLOCKER: Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
CLAUDE: Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
BLOCKER: I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
RAY: Let it go, Claude.
CLAUDE: I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
BLOCKER: Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
CLAUDE: But you can't.
BLOCKER: At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
