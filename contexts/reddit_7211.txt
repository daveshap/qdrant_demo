3 month review: boss told me I need to grow a backbone
I recently started a job that is very similar to a health inspector (think Hugo from Bob's Burgers) but is not in the food industry.  I go in and inspect places, educate them, give citations, and sometimes even shut places down.  You can guess that most of the people I deal with have some very choice words for me.  I've been yelled at and threatened.  I've only been given a few assignments since starting.  Got the job through a friend after taking some classes and obtaining certificates.

Boss calls me into the office for a review.  Very much a "no beating around the bush" sorta guy.  Tells me I need to grow a backbone.  To be honest, he's right.  I am awful at dealing with confrontation.  You wouldn't guess it by looking at me, but when people start becoming aggressive with me, I tend to lose focus which exposes my lack of experience.  I've been in the customer service industry for so long that my automatic response is to calm the situation by trying to appease the aggressor in any way possible.  This usually worked with your average Karen, but has not been very successful in my new line of work.

I've tried getting advice from my coworkers, but everyone just says the same thing: "Just man up!"  How the hell do I go about doing that?  I have to confront a guy tomorrow who has multiple violations and has already been a huge prick to me.  I'm dreading it.

I'm hoping someone on here has been in a similar scenario that could offer some advice on how to toughen myself up.  I can't give up on this job.

I apologize if this doesn't fit in this subreddit.  Thanks.
