DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: That's okay.
BETTY: I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: There was an accident. I came here.
BETTY: I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry. Are you all right?
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: A car ... a car accident.
BETTY: Are you okay?
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: I think so. I was just taking a shower.
BETTY: Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: My name is Rita.
BETTY: Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
RITA: No ..........I.
BETTY: I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
RITA: She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
BETTY: She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that. I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
RITA: I think I've been hurt.
BETTY: Oh...
RITA: No.
BETTY: But, this could be serious.
RITA: No...I need to sleep.
BETTY: If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
RITA: It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
BETTY: All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
JOE: So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.
ED: Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
JOE: Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
ED: Making ends meet, huh.
JOE: Hardly.
ED: Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
JOE: Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
ED: It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
JOE: Yeah, that's a funny story.
