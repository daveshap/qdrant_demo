CLIFF: I've seen him.
COCCOTTI: Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
CLIFF: What are you talkin' about?
COCCOTTI: I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
CLIFF: I don't believe you.
COCCOTTI: That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
CLIFF: On their honeymoon.
COCCOTTI: I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
CLIFF: They didn't tell me.
