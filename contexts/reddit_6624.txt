What do recruiters actually do day to day during hiring freezes?
I'm specifically asking what their actual job is during a hiring freeze, like there is now.

I've been in touch with a FANG recruiter recently who is slow to respond. She kept saying it's been 'crazy busy' due to the pandemic and everyone working remotely, etc.

I'm not trying to be rude here but what could she possibly be working on while there's a hiring freeze and a pandemic?

I don't doubt she's busy, just wondering what the job actually is besides the obvious?
