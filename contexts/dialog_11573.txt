ROSASHARN: Ma... Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
MA: Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
ROSASHARN: I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
MA: You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
ROSASHARN: An' you won't let nobody touch me?
MA: No--an' look what I got for you.
