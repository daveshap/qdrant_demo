ENZO: A new world record! That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow! You ever been to Tahiti?
JOHANA: No.
ENZO: I'll take you there. We'll live in the sun. You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
JOHANA: You forgot the Hula!
ENZO: Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
JOHANA: You'll be lovely, but no thanks. Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
