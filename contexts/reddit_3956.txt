What the actual F is up with dating these days?
Is it just me or is dating a complete hell these days? No one has any decency or respect. 

These are my dates over the past 3 months:

-go out with a chick. She ends up asking a random guy for coke and says she'll be right back she's going to do a bump in his car. Gets upset when I tell her I'm going home. 

-go on a hike date with a girl. She acts extremely interested then ghosts me 

-make plans to go out with a girl. Cancels. Plans again. Cancels.

-make plans to go out with a girl. Stands me up, Ghosts me. 

-make plans to go out with a girl. Ghosts me. 

-go out with a girl to a gay bar with her friends. Her friends leave. We go to another bar (her suggestion). We get there and she needs to go to the bathroom so I show her where it is. Wait like 10ft from it and I see her walk out of the restroom, immediately leave the bar, and get in a cab. Text her asking where she is and she's like "I thought you ditched me so I went home"

Dating in 2018 is an absolute disgrace. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person who isn't a piece of shit to other people.
