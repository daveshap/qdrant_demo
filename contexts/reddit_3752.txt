Dating = Darksouls
Dating is like playing Darksouls with no autosave.

You try. You die. You go back to the start. 
You try again. You die. You go back to the start. 
You try. You die. You go back to the start. 

You try. You get past the first boss! Then the second! You're on a roll now. You push that part of you aside that's telling you "Don't let your hopes up. You're going to die again just like all the other times". You get to the final boss. You make one mistake. 
You die.......  You go back to the start.

You're shattered. You're exhausted. You HATE this game and you want to stop playing it... 
... But you REALLY want to beat that final boss! You WANT it. You NEED it. You DESERVE it! 

So you try again. You die. You go back to the start. 
You try. You die. You go back to the start.
