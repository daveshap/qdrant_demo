LULA: Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
SAILOR: Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
