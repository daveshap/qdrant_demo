What to do when there's no assignments
I'm a web/graphic designer at my job and the work load is pretty low for me. I ask my supervisors for tasks or anything I can help them with and when they do have a task I finish it before the 8 hours are up. 
I would browse the internet but most non-work related websites are blocked. I feel lazy when I have nothing to do or like I'm doing something wrong by not having work to do. Is this normal for my position?
