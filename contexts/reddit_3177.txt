How many of you actually got to your current job by sending out resumés to job openings?
I've been out of work and sending out CVs for close to 6 months now. I've gotten absolutely no interviews, and only a couple of rejection notices. It's mostly radio silence.

I've watched a couple of job seeking lectures on Youtube, and these guys are telling us that spending time on your resumé and sending out CVs is a waste of time. However (obviously) to really find out what's the cool, hip way of finding a job, you have to sign up for their $99 lecture in which they'll teach us everything.

I suspect most of those only aim to prey at desperate unemployed people.

However, I'm at a loss here, as sending out resumés and applying to job openings on LinkedIn isn't bringing me anything.

So, how many of you actually got to your current jobs through this method?
