HELEN: You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
RUBEN: Not yet.
HELEN: Are you always so bold?
RUBEN: No. I'm shy and I'm selective.
RUBEN: The problem for me is... you're in the witness category. Know what I mean?
HELEN: Well. Another time, then. I'll be all right. He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
