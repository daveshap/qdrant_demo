MAX: Selina?! Selina ... Selina ...
SELINA: That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
MAX: Uh, Selina, this is, uh, Bruce Wayne.
BRUCE: We've met.
SELINA: Have we?
BRUCE: Sorry. I mistook me for somebody else.
SELINA: You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
BRUCE: Didn't I say that?
SELINA: Yes and no ...
BRUCE: What happened?
MAX: Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope? Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
