Stipend issues
My school has been overpaying me for months. Here I am thinking I got a small raise because my direct deposit went up. Aside from “I should have noticed” do you think it’s right for them to ask for their money back (not through small repayments)? I don’t see a lot of that money because it was taxed. They won’t even wait for my tax return to give them the money.
