Something I wrote and thought some of you could relate maybe
Depression is more than a dark cloud following you around. It’s pain, it’s sadness, it’s weight on your shoulders, it’s guilt, it’s frustration, it’s a lack of feeling like you’re enough, it’s an assumption that you’ve made about yourself that you’re not worth a *damn thing*. You look in the mirror and you might as well have the word mistake written on your forehead in permanent marker. You go through moments where you feel everything at once and then other moments where you feel nothing at all. You have reasons screaming at you to leave it all behind but your voice of reason is shouting *“no!”* in the far distance. Dreams remind you of the pain that your mind can’t forget, which naturally means you never get to escape. When you’re awake you cry and as the tears hit your cheek, they instantly shatter your sanity. In your dreams you may *scream* yourself awake. The feeling of sadness seems to creep into your fingers and toes, making it impossible to pick up the phone and ask for help, or walk into a place where you may find hope. The voice you have is no longer yours, it almost seems as if you are listening to another person speak, yet its your lips moving. *There would be less hurt if I wasn’t here. There would be less worrying on others if I weren’t here. There would be less…* Your mind even is too tired to finish the sentence. *You will be ok.* They tell me but it’s easier said then done because they don’t feel this.. *I have lost everything. I have no idea who I am anymore. Why am I here? I take 1 step forward and I fall at least 10 steps back. I need a sign that this isn’t for nothing.. that I’m not nothing.*
