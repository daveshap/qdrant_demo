I went no contact with my family and it hurts knowing that I probably won’t have a good relationship with them
Long history of abuse and controlling behavior from my family. I would have panic attacks at seeing a text message from my parents, and it got way worse around the holidays with them constantly asking me to come out and see them. And I couldn’t handle it anymore, so i cut contact and changed my information. Decided to stop letting the anxiety from then rule my life. 

And it sucks almost as much. They’re gone now, and I wouldn’t say I miss them because all I can think about is what they put me through. But despite planning to do this for years, it’s so much harder than I thought it would be. I am so sad that they’re gone for real now and I won’t get to have a real family. It wasn’t going to happen, realistically. But now the slim hope of it is gone.
