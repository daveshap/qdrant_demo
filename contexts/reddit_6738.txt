LinkedIn recruiter wants to chat by phone about opportunity
I was wondering what may I expect for this phone call? I have some LinkedIn messages from recruiters from legit companies that message me about an opportunity and to talk over the phone. I’ve never had this happen yet because I didn’t realize that LinkedIn recruiters were real and they weren’t all pyramid schemes. 

What are some things I can expect them to ask me? Will it be like a mini interview? What are some things I should ask?
