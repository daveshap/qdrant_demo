GILLIS: Yeah?
NORMA: You're a writer, you said.
GILLIS: Why?
NORMA: Are you or aren't you?
GILLIS: I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
NORMA: And you have written pictures, haven't you?
GILLIS: Sure have. The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
