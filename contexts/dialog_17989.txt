WITWER: There a maid in this hotel?
FLETCHER: I don't know, why?
WITWER: If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
FLETCHER: They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
WITWER: What kind of cop were you before this?
FLETCHER: I was a Treasury Agent for eight years. Why?
WITWER: Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
WITWER: I worked homicide before I went federal. This is what we would've called an orgy of evidence". Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy
FLETCHER: How many?
WITWER: None. This was arranged.
