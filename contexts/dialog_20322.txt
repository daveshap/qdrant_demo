TERRY: I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
EDIE: Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
TERRY: You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
EDIE: I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
TERRY: Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.

TERRY: I don't want to hurt Charley— I don't want to hurt you...

TERRY: That— —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .

TERRY: My hand.
EDIE: It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
TERRY: Edie...
EDIE: Get away from me.
TERRY: Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
EDIE: I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
TERRY: Edie, Edie, I...
