TRAMP: Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
TRAMP: Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
TRAMP: Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
TRAMP: I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
ALEX: Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
TRAMP: This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
TRAMP: Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
TRAMP: They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
ALEX: Then there was like a sea of dirty, smelly old men trying to get at your humble Narrator, with their feeble rookers and horny old claws. It was Old Age having a go at Youth and I daren't do a single solitary thing, O my brothers, it being better to be hit at like that, than want to be sick and feel that horrible pain. The Tramp crowd round Alex, shouting.
