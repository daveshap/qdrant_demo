Does the ABJ anomaly for the Abelian gauge field have a topological argument? We known that the ABJ anomaly for non-abelian gauge fields with gauge group containing $SU(2)$ as a subgroup has a topological argument from the Euclidean path integral. Through studying the Euclidean path integral we can find the BPST instanton. In presence of the BPST instanton, the number of left-handed chiral fermioinc zero-modes and right-handed chiral fermionic zero-modes is not equal. One can then interpret this fact as chiral violation.However, the ABJ anomaly exists for abelian gauge field as well. And we know  in this case, there is no Euclidean instantons anymore due to the gauge group structure. But we can still derive the anomaly by studying the triangle diagram. So it seems that the instanton argument is not general?
