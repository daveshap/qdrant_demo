RICHARD: So from there to there?
FRANCOISE: We swim.
RICHARD: Swim?
ETIENNE: We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
FRANCOISE: You can swim?
RICHARD: Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
ETIENNE: One or two kilometers.
RICHARD: Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
ETIENNE: Why?
RICHARD: We're going to swim one or two kilometers" across open sea
FRANCOISE: Have you told someone?
RICHARD: No.
FRANCOISE: I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
ETIENNE: Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
RICHARD: Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
