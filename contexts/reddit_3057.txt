What is the best way to resign from my job and leave on a good note?
Basically for the sake of getting money to pay bills I accepted a job offer as a casual sales assistant, I hate it and can’t wait to leave. Im in my third month about to come off my “probationary period.” I recently received a better offer from another company and I accepted. What is the best way to resign from this current job. After getting to know my manager and co workers in this short period of time I feel the manager and coworkers would take it personally and not well. What makes things worse is they currently have a few people leaving and resigning and the team isn’t big it’s a small store but they are in the process of hiring new staff. I would ideally like to leave on a good note and would offer two weeks notice even though I am casual and don’t have to give any.  But two weeks is the maximum amount I can give. As it already clashes with my new schedule. I have work tomorrow at my current job and I want to give notice as soon as possible I just don’t know how.
