ROY: Up to you.
LILLY: My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
ROY: Sure.
LILLY: The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
LILLY: That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
ROY: Bluebell came in?
LILLY: I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me. It didn't.
LILLY: Hi, Bobo.
BOBO: Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
LILLY: Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
BOBO: You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
