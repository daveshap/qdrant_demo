Does anyone else obsess over every little thing they say to people?
Pretty much every social interaction I have with someone, no matter how small, I spend a ridiculous amount of time afterwards playing back what I said over and over again in my head. Even if what I said was totally normal, I still harp on it and pick it apart until I've convinced myself I've made a fool of myself.
