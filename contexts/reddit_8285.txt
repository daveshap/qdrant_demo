Farm Seizures in South Africa: Is this a wide-spread practice, and what are the government's stated goals?
An article posted to the NZ Herald 3 days ago made it to the top of r/news, with the headline reading, "[South Africa begins seizing white-owned farms](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12110366)." Earlier today, the US President tweeted on the same topic: 

>I have asked Secretary of State @MikePompeo4USA to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews"

From my own searches, it's very hard to get reliable information on this topic.

The NZ Herald article, for example, doesn't point to a particular government policy targeting white farms, instead alluding to a list, released by a pro-Afrikaner civil-rights group, which supposedly names 190 targeted farms "being circulated" within the Department of Land Reform and Rural Development. The two farms seized by the government were reportedly the first two farms on this supposed list. The South African government denies knowledge of such a list existing.
