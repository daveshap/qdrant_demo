HANA: It's okay - I'll help. Please.
KIP: The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
HANA: What do I do?
KIP: There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance. I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
HANA: So I follow the wires?
KIP: You get Hardy.
HANA: I follow the wires.
