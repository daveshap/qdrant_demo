Anyone started their first real career after 30?
Late bloomer here. I spent my 20s working dead-end office jobs and getting my 2nd degree. Now I am 30 and ready to start a new career that is coding(really confident with the languages as I self taught for 1 year) related but not software development. I look younger than my age in general.

Should I be anxious about starting my first proper career now? I know we all have weaknesses/deal breakers that people judge, but we need to respect ourselves first before others could respect us. I know exactly what strengths I am selling to employers and am confident with it, but I still feel a bit anxious due to some regret of not having conformed to the usual career timeline of a "typical" person.

I am a bit of a perfectionist and do overanalyse things, so that is why I am anxious. I haven't started looking for new entry level jobs yet, but time is certainly up.

Please do share some similar positive experiences.

Thanks.
