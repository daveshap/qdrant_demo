In the US, who receives more public services and benefits: veterans or illegal immigrants?
At a Memorial Day biker rally in Washington DC last weekend Donald Trump said,

>"...in many cases, illegal immigrants [are taken much better care of] than veterans in this country." [Source, quote in 2nd video](http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-36410559)

Which got me thinking, who receives more public benefits, veterans or illegal immigrants?

&nbsp;

In 1996, "welfare reform legislation specifically limited the eligibility of immigrant households to receive assistance." [Source](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272702001883)

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, I am having trouble finding what federal programs are still available to undocumented immigrants, and many public assistance programs vary on a state-by-state basis. 

&nbsp;

Some benefits available to Veterans can be found on the US Department of Veterans Affairs website [here](http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/). These benefits are exclusive to veterans of the US armed forces and their families.

&nbsp;

Some factors to consider, but are not limited to: 


* Housing
* Food assistance
* Long term healthcare
* Emergency healthcare
* Mental healthcare services

Is there risk involved when attempting to receive public benefits as an undocumented or illegal immigrant?
