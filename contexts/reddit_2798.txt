Is it always a red flag when a company is in a rush to hire?
I'll try to make this brief - I have been looking for a job for about 2.5 months as my current job is super stressful (or alternately boring) & the commute is extremely long. I found a job in banking operations that pays more & is closer to home. Everything sounds good as far as pay, benefits, job duties, etc. It's a smaller regional bank, so unfortunately not a lot of info on Glassdoor or reviews on Indeed, no idea what turnover is like there.

I interviewed this morning & the manager let me know I was their final interview. It seemed to go well. About an hour later, I get a call & they're offering me the job! I asked if I could get back to them first thing tomorrow, but they want me to decide TODAY as the main HR person is leaving for vacation on Wednesday. They even asked if I could start in 1 week, which I said no, I would need 2 weeks at the very least to give notice to my current job.

I feel like in the past, the places that seem really desperate to hire are usually that way for a reason. Are there any questions I could ask them beforehand to make sure I'm not just filling a chair for them & they actually really want me there long term? Any advice is appreciated!!!
