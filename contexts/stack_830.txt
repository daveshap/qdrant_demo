Audio-recorder not recording in Ubuntu 18.04 Had Audio-Recorder working in earlier versions. Installed Ubuntu 18.04 and installed Audio-Recorder. There is no audio being recorded. Both \"Built-in Audio Analogue Stereo (Audio Output)\" or \"System's default device\" sources tried with same result. The level indicator at the top of the window also shows nothing. Can't find anything relevant with a Google search. Any advise please.ThanksTony
