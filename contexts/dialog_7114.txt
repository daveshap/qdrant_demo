DAVE: First Lady...
BOB: Don't worry. You won't even see her.
BOB: They barely talk anymore.
DAVE: You're kidding?
BOB: It happens. This is where you'll be sleeping.
DAVE: Holy cow.
BOB: We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
DAVE: Oh... Okay.
