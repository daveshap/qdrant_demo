WOMAN'S VOICE: I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper... ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
NORMAN'S VOICE: Mother, please...
WOMAN'S VOICE: And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
NORMAN'S VOICE: Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
WOMAN'S VOICE: Mother, she's just a stranger! As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
WOMAN'S VOICE: Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
NORMAN'S VOICE: Shut up! Shut up!
MARY: I've caused you some trouble.
NORMAN: Mother... ...what is the phrase... she isn't herself today"... I think that's it."
MARY: You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
NORMAN: I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
MARY: Don't worry about it. But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
