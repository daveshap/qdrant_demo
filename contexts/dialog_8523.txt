DECK SERGEANT: Yes sir!
HAN: Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
DECK SERGEANT: I haven't seen him. He probably came in through the south entrance.
HAN: Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
THREEPIO: I don't know, Artoo. Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
HAN: Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
