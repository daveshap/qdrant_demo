To whoever said, "If you're on Povertyfinance, you should be filing taxes free, THANK YOU."
I was already 90 percent of the way done with Turbo Tax. We've done Turbo Tax for 13 years. This year they wanted $120 out of our refund just to file. We didn't even have anything complicated. I have heard this a lot this year though. We filed for free last year. 

Tried Credit Karma. It's basically like doing a manual TT W-2 and it was actually faster. When I couldn't get last year's return AGI from TT without PAYING for it, I went to the IRS website and got it. It took 5 mins.  Don't give Turbo Tax your money.
