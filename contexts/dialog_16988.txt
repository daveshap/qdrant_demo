MICHELLE: Did you know... about Raoul?
LOUIS: I did not want to upset you. It was tragic. I did everything I could for him. I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting. But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
LOUIS: I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
MICHELLE: Oh Louis, Louis...
PORTHOS: Aramis... is this the way to hell?
ARAMIS: Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
PORTHOS: Where are we?
ARAMIS: Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane. If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
PORTHOS: Mother of God!
ARAMIS: It is also a place of burial.
PORTHOS: A tomb? We're in a tomb?
ARAMIS: Catacombs. Very holy.
