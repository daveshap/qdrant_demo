What have you learned from losing a job?
This is a hard topic, a heartbroken one with  unspeakable amount of selfdoubt and intense feeling of worthless. I know it's horrible, because I'm going through it now.  For the first time in my career of almost a decade, I don't have a job anymore. I knew my career was stall with this company, and I wasn't happy with it, but I didn't act on it to look for next job, until being let go. I was too attached to my job and I forgot the reality of corporate world. I was too distracted by other aspects in my life, that I didn't prioritize career development. So it is a wakeup call for me, painful one though. 


I'd rather put my regret in the perspective of learning from my experience, and if possible to hear you my Redditor friends' learning experience. 


Because I'd like to think (and know for fact) losing a job is not the end of life, there is still hope and a better future.
