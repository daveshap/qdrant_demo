Can I get a job in banking with just a minor in finance?
I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this or if this is a stupid question.

I'm currently a high school senior that is completely confused as to where she even wants to attend college. I recently got a likely letter and invitation to Duke so they've really been on my mind. I was wanting to do political science and minor in finance. Then eventually get an MBA. I was wondering if this would be enough to get a job in the finance/banking field. I was also wondering if this route is practical enough to allow me to become a CPA. Again, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place. Thank you for you help.


Note: Duke does not have a business school/major and I would much rather prefer to not major in econ.
