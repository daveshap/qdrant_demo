SERENA: How could this happen?
ELLE: I don't know! I don't know anything any more! I just need to be by myself.
SERENA: Are you sure?
MARGOT: We still love you. Sisters forever!
ELLE: Thank you. I love you, too.
MARGOT: Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
SERENA: Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you. Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
MARGOT: You're right. Phew!
