Burnt Out - Need Advice
I need some advice. I'm about 10 months into a new position, and I dont know if I could be in a worse place. I feel like I'm starting to lose tasks and my performance is starting to suffer. My coworkers have been supportive and they know I'm getting beaten up, they admit it is all somewhat normal for our department, especially for this time of the year. This has helped a lot

But...

I just don't think this position or department is right for me. I enjoy certain aspects, but I'm just tired of feeling beat up. I'm formulating some next steps, looking at pursuing a Ph.D. program full time, even thinking about leaving the field. In a phonecall with a parent, I had a panic attack, and almost pack up my office.

On the personal front I've been doing what I can to build support. I've been seeing a counselor as well. It's been helping, but I don't think my job is healthy for me. 

Here's the question, how do I get out? How do I plan an exit? When should and how should I approach a conversation with my supervisor?
