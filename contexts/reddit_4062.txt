Has anyone ever been infatuated with the “idea” of a person but no so much the person themselves.
Hey reddit,
So I just realised today , that perhaps the person I have a crush on I don’t really like , it’s more “the mental image” of them which I have created in my mind. You see this we’ve know each other for quite a while, but only began texting a couple of months ago. It was this whole process of texting them that I really started to develop feelings ( perhaps it was due to the fact of loneliness for such a long ) . But you see our interaction by text and IRL are different. When I see her IRL  I’m not infatuated, by all means she’s attractive, but she’s not some “be all end all “figure I have painted her out to be.  IRL we just talk like friends, but when we text it’s different. Maybe it’s because my infatuation has decreased  because “i see them as hard to get”. 


TLDR 
I think I’m more attracted to the image and concept of a person being a romantic partner, created through weeks of texting . Yet IRL , I just see them as more of a normal person
