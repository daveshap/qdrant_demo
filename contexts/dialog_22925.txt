DIANE: Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; Glad I finally met you"
LLOYD: Mine say stuff like Lloyd
DIANE: Nobody knew me before tonight.
LLOYD: They knew of you. Now they know you.
DIANE: Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
LLOYD: That's cool then.
DIANE: Yeah. I'm so glad we did this.
LLOYD: It's just you and your dad, right?
DIANE: Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
LLOYD: Sure I do.
DIANE: Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them. So I chose my dad. It just felt safer that way, you know?
LLOYD: Watch out for that glass.
DIANE: Thanks. But either way it still feels...
LLOYD: Twisted?
DIANE: You know what?
LLOYD: What?
DIANE: You're a great date. I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
LLOYD: Basic. Hmmm.
DIANE: So what's your job this summer?
LLOYD: Job? Being a great date.
DIANE: No, I'm serious.
LLOYD: So am I. I want to see you again. I want to see you as much as I can before you leave. I said it.
DIANE: I only have something like sixteen weeks.
LLOYD: Sixteen weeks is a long time.
DIANE: Then call me tomorrow.
LLOYD: Today is tomorrow.
DIANE: Then call me later.
