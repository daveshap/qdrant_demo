I FINALLY did my dishes and I DIDN'T get Anxiety!
**I just wanted to share this moment with everyone because I am proud.**

 I usually can't do my dishes without getting a small panic attack/anxiety and TODAY I DID NOT get any anxiety and it went really well. I took my time and it is finally DONE after weeks on end of procrastinating. I have my laundry done too, bathroom half clean/kitchen half clean and living room half clean. I am almost done! Here's to hoping I can stay this motivated and it stays clean haha.
