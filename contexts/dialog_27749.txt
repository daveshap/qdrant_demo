MACFARLANE: See that, Fettes?
FETTES: A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
MACFARLANE: Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
FETTES: They'll be thinking of that, too.
MACFARLANE: Tosh! Fettes! It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
FETTES: You've no thought of going there?
MACFARLANE: Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel? I've had some practice in the art.
FETTES: You couldn't do that, Doctor.
MACFARLANE: I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows. We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
FETTES: No.
MACFARLANE: Why not? I must have subjects. It's the only way I can teach. It's the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
