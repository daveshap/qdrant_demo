Employer Missed Payroll. Do I Jump Ship ASAP?
- Working as a legal assistant for a criminal law firm
- we have financial issues and many outstanding debts. 
- Payroll has always been iffy in the few months that ive been there. There have been multiple times where I've had to go to my boss' house to pick up my pay cheque. 
- Today my boss has gone radio silent. It's 4 minutes left of my shift and I have yet to receive my cheque.
