TEDDY: What's wrong?
LEONARD: There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
LEONARD: He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
TEDDY: No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
LEONARD: Maybe. Maybe just.
