ORSINI-ROSENBERG: Are you absolutely sure?
SALIERI: I've seen the manuscript.
ORSINI-ROSENBERG: Where?
SALIERI: Never mind.
VON STRACK: I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG: For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
VON STRACK: Oh yes, yes. And that was?
ORSINI-ROSENBERG: Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
VON STRACK: Ah.
