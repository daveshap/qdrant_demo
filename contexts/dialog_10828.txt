STANTZ: You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
VENKMAN: Yeah, sorry I missed it. I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here. It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
STANTZ: It's all over the city, Pete -- well, under it actually.
WINSTON: Rivers of the stuff!
SPENGLER: And it's all flowing toward the museum.
STANTZ: Sorry!
DANA: Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
VENKMAN: Boys, listen. You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
SPENGLER: This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
