Asking a girl out
Alright so,

I've liked this girl I'm friends with in my music class for a while now and need some advice for asking them out. We're both pretty introverted and I feel like I'm overthinking this. The problem is, we're in a work group, the other two people are my and her friend, and I don't wanna make anything weird for the rest of the group.

Please help my awkward gamer ass
