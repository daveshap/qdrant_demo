LENNY: Hi, baby. I've missed you.
FAITH: I know. Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
LENNY: I'm already hurting.
FAITH: You have to go. I mean it.
LENNY: Yeah, OK, whatever you say. Just answer one question. Is anything wrong? Iris said you might be in trouble.
FAITH: You talked to Iris? When?
LENNY: Tonight.
FAITH: Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head. You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
LENNY: I know you Faith. You're afraid of something. What's going on?
FAITH: Let it alone, Lenny. It'll take care of itself.
LENNY: It's Tran, isn't it? This guy is poison, Faith. Listen to me. He's got you walled in on all sides. And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
FAITH: That's a good one, coming from you.
LENNY: Why don't you just split? You don't love him, anybody can see that. And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
FAITH: He has his uses too.
LENNY: What? He gonna record you on his label?
FAITH: Maybe.
LENNY: Come on, Faith! He's just toying with you. And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
LENNY: Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing. You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it. And you will.
FAITH: Damn right.
LENNY: It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
FAITH: You have to get out of here. If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy. He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid. He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
LENNY: Max Pelcher? You're kidding?
FAITH: Yeah, for about a month now. Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay? And stay away from me. Stop trying to rescue me. Those days are over. I'm a big girl now. Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
LENNY: Can't do it.
FAITH: You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat? Because they always say The End." You always know when it's over. It's over! Now please leave. I have to go on again in a couple of minutes."
