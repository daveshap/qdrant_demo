MAXINE: Darling!
MALKOVICH: What the fuck is going on?
CRAIG: Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
MALKOVICH: Simulates?
CRAIG: Sure, after a fashion.
MALKOVICH: Let me try.
CRAIG: You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
MALKOVICH: Let me try!
MAXINE: Let him try.
CRAIG: Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
