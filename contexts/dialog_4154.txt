MRS. BEAUMONT: I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY: For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
MRS. BEAUMONT: Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
JEFFREY: Mom.
