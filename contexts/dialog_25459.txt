PICARD: You actually performed surgery...?
BEVERLY: It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
BEVERLY: But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
PICARD: How did Doctor Almack react to that?
BEVERLY: He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed. Any word from the Enterprise?
PICARD: Not yet.
BEVERLY: You think they're still up there?
PICARD: If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
BEVERLY: That might not be so bad... at least for you.
