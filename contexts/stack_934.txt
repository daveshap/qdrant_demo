Preseed auto partition disk with no prompting only if disk is empty (no existing partition tables) Is it possible to setup a Ubuntu preseed for a one drive system, so that if the drive is empty (we can assume empty means it has no MBR or GPT partition tables) it goes right ahead and partitions it automatically, however if there are already partitions on the disk it prompts for manual partitioning?This way I can quickly dd out the partition table of a disk, and just run the install to auto create, yet if somehow I ran the install perhaps by error on existing system it wouldn't just blindly format and setup new partitions.Thanks.
