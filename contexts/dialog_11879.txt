RACHEL: Kido. It's four in the morning.
JAMIE: I can't sleep.
RACHEL: What is this? Four nights in a row? You going for a record here? The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
JAMIE: Do you love me Rachel?
RACHEL: Oh, serious questions tonight. Of course I love you.
JAMIE: Like a sister?
RACHEL: Jamie, sometimes it's...
JAMIE: Like a real sister?
RACHEL: We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
JAMIE: Sure it does.
RACHEL: I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
JAMIE: It's been eleven months.
RACHEL: Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age. I bet you didn't know that.
JAMIE: Your lucky. I wish she could do the same for me.
RACHEL: Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed. Come on Sunday.
