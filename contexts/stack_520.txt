Server backdoor via Internet I'm installing a number of machines into an overseas site, and I am fearful that I might get cut out after the machines are up and running.I'd like to install a backdoor into Ubuntu server so I can gain access if I do get screwed over.Is there any way I can connect, without knowing the external IP address, without having the firewall forwarding ports etc?
