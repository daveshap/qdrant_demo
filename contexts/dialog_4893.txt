TOM: You're an amazing woman. What a feeling having you inside my head.
JANE: Yeah. It was an unusual place to be.
TOM: Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it. There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
TOM: You have to celebrate with me, don't you? Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
JANE: I'm going over to Aaron's. Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later. How long do you think you'll be there?
