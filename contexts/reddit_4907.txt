I’m struggling to find a reason.
I don’t see any point in staying. What stopped you?

Edit: hey guys I’m so thankful for your replies. I contacted my psychologist who directed me to  a free group therapy program and my boss has agreed to allow me to take time off work every week to participate. 

I really feel like this will help and perhaps bring purpose into my life. I am still feeling very low and have intent however your ideas and perspective has been taken on board. ❤️
