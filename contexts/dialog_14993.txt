BREN: Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
JUNO: I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
BREN: A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
JUNO: They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
BREN: You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
JUNO: I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
BREN: That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
JUNO: Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
BREN: It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
JUNO: You don't know anything about me!
BREN: I know enough.
JUNO: We don't even have a dog!
BREN: Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
JUNO: Wow, dream big!
BREN: Oh, go fly a kite.
