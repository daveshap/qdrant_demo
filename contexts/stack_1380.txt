XBee power supply design using a Li-Po 3.7V battery I'm currently designing the power supply for a device which uses XBee PRO S2C as a medium of communication. We are using a Lipo battery 3.7V 3500 mAh battery and TP4056 based battery charger.The problem is:XBee PRO S2C operating voltage is 2.6 to 3.7V. However when the lipo battery is fully charged, its voltage jumps to 4.2V and at this voltage the XBee does not operate and is damaged.What can be the best option to reduce the Lipo battery supply to feed the XBee power?I can use a PN diode or Schottky diode, but it works only if the battery voltage level is above 4.0V as it is consuming 0.7V as voltage drop (PN diode) and Schottky depends on current consumption.The best option I found is using a LDO regulator of operating voltage at 3.0V and low drop out of 0.2V. Will this regulator work for the requirement I'm looking for?
