FRANK: I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure. Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got.
WALLS: Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
FRANK: These are hard times, Tom.
WALLS: Yeah. Great, isn't it?
FRANK: Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
WALLS: Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
FRANK: Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
WALLS: Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off.
FRANK: The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
WALLS: Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
