Should I be discouraged?
I've been thinking about moving to a bigger city. How ever I feel discouraged that jobs wont hire me due to a class b theft  misdemeanor when I was 17 due to disciplinary actions by my parents. After 9 years it still comes up. How do I go about finding a job in the place that I want to go to that pays decently well for the financial needs yet not being turned down for a mistake that happened so long? I just want a chance.
