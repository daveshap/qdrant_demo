How prevalent are secular/Atheist Conservatives? What are the reasons underlying their political persuasion?
Speaking personally, I am a non-religious Democrat, and I would say that my lack of religiosity at least somewhat influences my views on social issues. I did, however, grow up in a religious household and was a Republican by age eighteen. I've changed a lot since then, but at that time, my views on social issues were very much influenced by my religious beliefs.

So that leads me to wonder, what are the motivating factors in an Atheist or secular individual gravitating towards a Conservative/Republican worldview?

If right-leaning stances on social issues are not in any way influenced by religion, then what would be the reasoning behind, say, being against same-sex marriage or being pro-life? (I know these are the obvious hot-button issues, I'm just using them as easy examples)

Maybe their secular Conservatism generally has more of a basis in a single issue such as Economics or Gun rights?

Surely there must be some folks who self-identify this way and can offer some insight? I would just like to understand more about this as it fascinates me.

EDIT:  [Here is an article from Gallup including a statistic indicating that Conservatives generally skew towards a religious disposition.](http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/182210/highly-religious-conservative-republicans.aspx)
