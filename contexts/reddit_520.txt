What do you think?
Hi guy’s I always feel depressed but when I search for the symptoms I don’t usually fall under any category,I have a friend,okay right here some of you would think I’m jelous or whatever.But the truth is I want my friend’s to excel or even do better than me,but it’s so painful when they put zero effort and I worked but butt of only to be in one position,back to my friend,Anytime we go to class she gets high marks than me I’ll be like cool,my teachers award marks randomly,but every time it’s always the same story why can’t I be lucky at least just once,I’m not bluffing y’all,most times people that I’m better than perform lower than me also,must times I’m always the unlucky one even non academically,apart from this my friend in junior and high school i had the same problems I always never had luck,till today I feel like just giving up,I don’t know what else to do,I’m crying writing these things,every one thinks I’m fine but no area of my life is balanced I’m loosing all hopes,I’ve prayed also but it all seems to be getting worse.
