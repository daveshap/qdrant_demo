Should I negotiate for $2,000 dollars more a year?
I just interviewed for a government contractor job. The location, nature of the work, and benefits are all right up my alley. Before even interviewing for the role, the job announcement clearly stated a salary band of 56-58k a year. I managed to get a first, second, and third interview. Things went well in the interview, I am praying that an offer comes in soon. If they produce an offer, should I ask for the high end of the salary range.

I know I'm not willing to walk away from the opportunity, but given how expensive my area is, I feel like I should at least try to get more. When I negotiate, should I raise them to 60k/61k or something like that and ask if we can meet in the middle? Or should I just ask for the straight 58K? Given that it's a federal contracting company, my instincts tell me they have a very rigid pay structure and that they truly would not be able to go above 58k. Also, do most offers still come in like an email form? It's been awhile since I've switched jobs and I think the last time, I got an email and a phone call. Is there like a negotiating cheat sheet someone can refer me to? Sorry I'm a neub haha, but I never ask for more money and this time, I want to try at least.

TLDR: Should I try to bargain for just 2k more a year? 

Edit: Thank you all for your responses! The recruiter sent me forms today from the employer and one of the questions asked what my salary expectations were so I wrote, “negotiable.” Wish me luck!
