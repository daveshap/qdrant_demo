Asking reasons as to why I got rejected
Hi Reddit. I need advices, guys. Basically what the title says. A little backstory. I had a Zoom interview one month ago, then one week ago I got called in for a face-to-face interview, in which the interviewers told me they were very interested in my profile, skillset and experience, leading me to believe it almost was a done deal. Yesterday I got an email (at 11.41 pm on a Friday night) saying they decided not to offer me the position. To say I am disappointed it’s un understatement. The way they talked to me and praised my working profile, really led me to believe I was the guy they were looking for. Maybe I misread the situation, I do not know. Anyhow, I was very interested in the position. I would like to call the interviewer and simply ask him what were the main reasons why I got rejected. Was my long period of notice at my current job (2 months), so they went for someone who was going to be available earlier than me? Was the money I asked too much for their budget? My mind is spiraling right now. I would like to call just to understand what I don’t have to do/say the next time I got lucky to get a recruiting opportunity.
Thank you very much for your advice.
