PENNY PRIDDY: What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
BUCKAROO BANZAI: I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
PENNY PRIDDY: Go away. Let me rot?
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Who were you really trying to kill last night?
PENNY PRIDDY: You. Like the papers all say.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Pretty terrible shot.
PENNY PRIDDY: Was she pretty?
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Who?
PENNY PRIDDY: The girl I remind you of.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
PENNY PRIDDY: It's kinda hard this way.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
PENNY PRIDDY: The Netherlands. Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
PENNY PRIDDY: No. Laramie. Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that? Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: No, I don't.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
PENNY PRIDDY: Which? The one in my throat.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Did you have family there--? A sister? In Cody?
PENNY PRIDDY: I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Another 'you'?
PENNY PRIDDY: Somewhere. See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby. I was adopted.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Adopted. I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
PENNY PRIDDY: What? I don't understand you. I don't understand anything anymore.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Who does? It's a crazy mixed-up world. Just do the best you can with what you have...
PERFECT TOMMY: Running a little late, Buckaroo.
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Let her out. In my custody.
PERFECT TOMMY: Let her out? She's a killer.
