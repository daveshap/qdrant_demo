Is it necessary to go into debt to go to grad school?
I graduated with a BA in Sociology last May and I would love to continue my education but I'm really afraid of going deep into debt. Thankfully, for undergrad I went to cc, then transferred to the cheapest public university in the state while living at home. I see a lot of friends and family members swimming in debt and it *terrifies* me. I don't come from a background with a ton of money so I'd qualify for some financial aid and hopefully some scholarships. I'm at the very beginning of my grad school search, not sure what exactly I want to do yet. But the money part stresses me out. Any tips you'd share with me on how to finance my education, and things to avoid? Any reliable resources that you found helpful?
