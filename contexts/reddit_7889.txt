Thoughts on using text-to-speech programs to review literature?
I know this may sound crazy, but one of my professors just posted a recorded lecture because she was unable to make it to one of our classes, and I loved it? I never thought of myself as an auditory learner, but it was so much easier to take notes. I guess I never put too much thought into it during the lecture because it was just what I had to do, but being able to pick my speed and pausing the video when I needed to and being able to revise what she explains was amazing. 

Is it an off the chart idea to try and do this with papers? I'm not a huge fan of reading papers, and I guess if I had someone reading it to me, I could just listen to it like a podcast and follow along on the paper and make notes as they are being said. It's like listening to a seminar talk or conference talk, which I also really like! 

Any thoughts are welcome!
