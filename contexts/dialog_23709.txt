WENDY: Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!
JACK: I'm not going to hurt you.
WENDY: Stay away from me,
JACK: Wendy!
WENDY: Stay away...!
JACK: Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you. You didn't let me finish my sentence. I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!' I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
