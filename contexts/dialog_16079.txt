CLAUDE: Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
WILKINS: He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
RAY: I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
PIKE: Shoot him, Wilkins!
CLAUDE: Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this. Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
RAY: He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
PIKE: He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
WILKINS: Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
RAY: That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
PIKE: Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
RAY: He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it.
WILKINS: Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
PIKE: What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
