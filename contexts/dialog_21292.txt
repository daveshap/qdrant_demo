SUSAN: Jeremy! How Fantastic.
JEREMY: Darling Susan.
SUSAN: You're so famous now.
JEREMY: And you're so beautiful. What are you doing here?
SUSAN: We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools. World history since 1945. Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
JEREMY: In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
SUSAN: Was that your chapter, then? It was very good.
JAMES: Thank you. We met last week, at the Wajda film. You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.
SUSAN: Yes, that's right. I'm being terribly rude. Bob? Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett. Bon was at Oxford too.
