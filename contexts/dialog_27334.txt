STARKS: This is a great song.
WAITRESS: You remember it?
STARKS: But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
WAITRESS: May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
STARKS: They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
WAITRESS: So you never knew your mother?
STARKS: I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
WAITRESS: I'm sorry.
STARKS: Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
WAITRESS: Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
STARKS: How?
WAITRESS: She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
STARKS: I'm sorry.
WAITRESS: Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
STARKS: That when you stopped being a nurse?
