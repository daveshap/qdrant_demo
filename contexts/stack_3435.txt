KEK access control I have a linux server.I want to encrypt (and decrypt) data that is stored in a database. There are several processes that need to be able to do this, some of them my own applications, but also scripts running under nginx.I want to use a Data Encryption Key (DEK) to do so. In order to unlock the DEK I use a Key Encryption Key (KEK). The KEK is provided by prompting the administrator when the system boots.What is the best way of storing the DEK so that these processes (but only these!) have access to it? My initial idea was to store it in shared memory, but that means every process has potential access to it. (is that correct?)The next idea was to store it on a tmpfs, which at least has some access control (with regards to UIDs and GIDs) on which process can and cannot read it.
