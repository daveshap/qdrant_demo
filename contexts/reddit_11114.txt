My best friend just died
I’m 15 and he was 17. We had gotten so close together. I was just told 30 minutes ago that he died in a car crash. He was one of the best runners in the state for his age. He loves cars so much. The same thing that he enjoyed doing took his life. We had even joked about who’s car would be faster when we grew up. All of his money went into his car. He had just recently bought some new stuff for his 2014 Camaro and was waiting to put it on. That car was going to look so good when he was done with it. I had recently gotten him into motorcycles too. He’s the reason I love cars so much, and he’s the reason I go to the gym. We even played Xbox all the time and he spent so much time playing forza. He would sit there for hours building a car and making a perfect tune for it.  I’m mainly writing this to get it off my chest, but I love and miss you already bro. I don’t know what I’ll do without you. R.I.P 🙏

Edit: thank you everyone it really helps. Also thank you for the gold and silver, I’ll make sure to use it for him. It’s okay if you comment F because he loved memes so I’m sure he would be okay with it

Edit 2: no I’m not using him for karma. It just helps being able to read through the comments

Wow I didn’t think it would blow up this much. I don’t care about the karma, I barely use reddit anyways. All of this goes to him

I don’t even care about trying to prove you guys wrong anymore. If you want to look it up go research it for yourself but some of you people really need to live life better than going around trying to make people feel bad for a ‘fake post’ when it’s not fake. I literally just made it to help me deal with the situation. I didn’t even know what gold or even karma was before I made this. I don’t want to give the article out for privacy of the family because if you guys would say this stuff to me I couldn’t imagine what you would say to them.
