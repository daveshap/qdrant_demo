MR. VESCI: John, what a surprise. I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
JOHN: I know, Mr. Vesci. I know. I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had. You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
MR. VESCI: That's a shame, John. A real shame.
JOHN: You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it. I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
MR. VESCI: Let me guess. This robber; he gets your money.
JOHN: No. He gets shot by the old lady.
MR. VESCI: The old lady?
JOHN: With a shotgun. It kills him, and it shreads the money. I mean, what are the odds?
MR. VESCI: You're the gambler. You tell me.
JOHN: I had to beat it before the cops showed up. I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage. I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all. So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car. I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
MR. VESCI: Let me get this straight: You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
JOHN: A hundred-forty-five really.
MR. VESCI: A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk: I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller. You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it. I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
MR. VESCI: Do you understand me you little fuck?
JOHN: Yes, Mr. Vesci.
MR. VESCI: And John, don't make me come look for you.
MR. VESCI: Fucking kid. And look at you; breaking fucking pencils. You're a Neanderthal.
JOHN: Hello? Hello!? Operator, I got disconnected. Hello . . .
