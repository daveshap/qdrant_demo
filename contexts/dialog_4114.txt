DIEGO: Thirty-six hours. I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
GEORGE: I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
DIEGO: Touche.
GEORGE: But to the victor belong the spoils.
GEORGE: Half a million for you. Half a million for me. One-point-three five for the Colombians.
DEREK: Nice doing business with you, George.
GEORGE: Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?
ALESSANDRO: Greetings, Mr. George.
GEORGE: Where do you guys want to count?
ALESSANDRO: On the plane.
GEORGE: What plane? We going someplace? Where we headed? You have your money. It's all there. What the fuck is going on?
DIEGO: George, good to see you, my brother.
GEORGE: What the fuck is going on? When did you get out of jail?
DIEGO: Pablo used his influence. Now, George, watch what you say. Everybody hears everything. A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America. Life is cheap here, you know? No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
GEORGE: Yeah. Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
DIEGO: Right. Now who is the person in California? The connection?
GEORGE: Just a friend.
DIEGO: Who? I need to know. Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later.
GEORGE: Yeah. You do the talking.
