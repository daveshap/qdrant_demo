BERT: How're the hands?
EDDIE: They're fine.
BERT: Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
FINDLEY: That seems a shame. The night is young.
BERT: The night is two thousand dollars old.
EDDIE: Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
BERT: I said we're leavin'.
EDDIE: I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.

EDDIE: All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
