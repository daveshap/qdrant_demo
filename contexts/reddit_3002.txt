How do you deal with decision fatigue?
As I reflect back on my life, I'm reminded by just how far I've come. This time last year, I wasn't too happy. I was in a dead beat job, and while I'm still not where I desire to be, or my friends are at, I'm slowly matching the gap. I guess, how do you guys decide what you are going to do in any given day, or in regards to your job. I often find myself thinking that perhaps maybe I should of went to a better school, which would've allowed me better connections. But then I'm reminded I graduated debt free. I wish I took this job offer, so I could gain more valuable experiences, but I stayed behind since I wasn't sure if it was necessarily better for my career. I do this so often. Even clothes. I didn't grow up rich, and we had enough to scrape by. But that mentality and feeling had carried me on. I have nice clothes that I've attained over the years, but I prefer comfy clothes, since I'd rather deal with washing clothes I don't care about, because if I wore nice clothes, I'd feel I waste them. Now I'm not insane, or crazy, I still get out of bed and I'm not depressed. I'm in a good place, I just wonder if things would of turned out differently if I worked harder or maybe lazier, so to speak. I wonder if I maybe left home later how my life might turn out different. It's kind of bizarre when you think about it. Am I the only one that feels this way? Please tell me you think about this as well. Thanks in advance for reading.
