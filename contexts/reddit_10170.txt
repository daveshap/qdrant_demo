It’s extremely messed up that you can’t even go to a psych hospital for help with suicidal thoughts without getting a multi-thousand dollar hospital bill.
I was in a psych ward once when I was 17. I struggle with suicidal ideation daily. I would totally go back and get treatment at a hospital again if it weren’t for the horrible treatment of patients and the bill that would come along with it. My bill at my psych hospital was about $20,000. All because I wanted to jump off a bridge. You can’t tell anyone that you’re suicidal without them throwing you in a mental hospital, but you can’t go to a mental hospital without owing thousands of dollars and being treated like a prisoner, just making your problems even worse. There’s no good solution. I want to have the right to die. Or at least get free help. The suicidal hotline doesn’t do shit. I want real help. And not to be thrown in a hospital. This system is horrible. We are all victims of it. It’s time for a mental health industry overhaul.
