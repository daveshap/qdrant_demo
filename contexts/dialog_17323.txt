CYPHER: You are a beautiful woman. Too bad things had to work out like this.
TRINITY: You killed them.
APOC: What?!
SWITCH: Oh, God.
CYPHER: I'm tired, Trinity. I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day. But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
TRINITY: My God. Morpheus. You gave them Morpheus.
CYPHER: Yes. You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future. But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
TRINITY: The Matrix isn't real!
CYPHER: Oh, I disagree, Trinity. I disagree. I think the Matrix is more real than this world. I mean, all I do is pull a plug here. But there, you watch a man die.
