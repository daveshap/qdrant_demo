Gaps in Resume
I resigned my position back in February because it was time-intensive (and I had saved up enough money to take a mental health break from a very stressful work situation) so I could devote my time to healing myself and finding a new job. Then Covid hit and I havenâ€™t been able to find anything. How can I explain this gap to prospective employers?
