How much damage do I have to inflict onto an enemy to still get XP even if a companion/someone other than me finishes them off? Sometimes I put quite a few bullets into an enemy, someone/something else kills them, and I still get XP for it. Other times I put quite a few bullets into an enemy, someone/something else kills them, and I'm not rewarded any XP. So how much damage do I have to inflict onto an enemy to ensure I'm rewarded XP upon their death?
