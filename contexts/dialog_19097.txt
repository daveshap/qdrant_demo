DIDIER: Hello there, Picart.
PICART: Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
DIDIER: Why are you carrying the dog?
PICART: His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
DIDIER: When you eat him, may I have some?
PICART: My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog? I would rather eat Cossack.
NARRATOR: On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded. Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time. The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
NAPOLEON: A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us. Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
