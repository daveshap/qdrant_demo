Had to cry today...
I really thought today was going to be the first day of 2020 I didn't cry. Can I please just have one day where the tears don't flow? I have been trying so hard with medication, therapy and self care but every day my eyes end up red and raw. I'm just so tired of even trying anymore. I'm ready for the hurt to be over.
