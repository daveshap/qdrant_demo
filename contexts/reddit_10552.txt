My cousin was killed by his girlfriend about a year ago.
My cousin was killed by his girlfriend about a year ago. They were having a fight; she was angry and vindictive like always, they were screaming and arguing at each other. He was fed up with her shit and finally decided to leave her. She called the cops. He got in his car to leave. "He's got a gun" she screams. My cousin puts his hands up. Cops think he's raising a gun and they shoot him 14 times. My cousin is left in a semi comatose state. Over the next couple of weeks the hospital sends us updates of his condition; they claim he's improving rapidly and regaining neural and motor functions. It was all lies, He died in the hospital one week later. The Cops claim he was standing when he pointed a gun at them and they acted in self defense. More lies. The ballistics show that he was sitting in the car when he was shot.  For the longest time I never accepted that he was dead, It just never seemed real to me and For the longest time I have been suppressing my emotions but recently this horrible feeling of dread has been seeping over me. The thought of death or dying sends me into a state of intense anxiety complete with Panic attacks. I cant take this anymore; every time it happens I just think over and over again "Why me"  "Why did things have to be like this" "I wish i never even had these thoughts" I don't want to feel like this anymore. This is no way to live I shouldn't have to feel like this every day. I want to Die. But i cant. It would cause my family too much grief and they would never understand why i did it. The Last thing I want to do is to spread grief to my family. I wish I had never of been born so I would never have to experience these feelings.
