RAYMOND: A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
MARCEL: Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
RAYMOND: There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.

RAYMOND: I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
MARCEL: How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
