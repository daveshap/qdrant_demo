JACKIE: You're just gonna walk?
STARKS: Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
JACKIE: What're those?
STARKS: Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
JACKIE: What for?
STARKS: [Beat] In case you get lost, or can't remember who you are.
STARKS: I think I can remember what's on them.
JACKIE: William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
