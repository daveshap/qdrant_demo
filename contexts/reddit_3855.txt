Ghosting is when you send someone a ghost 👻 emoji, right?
So my mom is meeting men using a dating app. Below is what she texted me... Too cute! I think I like this version of ghosting. 🤔🤣

Mom: Guess what I found out what GHOSTING is. I’m pretty hip.”

Me: Oh ya? What do you think ghosting is?

Mom: Ghosting is when you send someone a ghost emoji 👻 when you don’t want to talk to them anymore. 

Me: 🤦🏻‍♀️....🤣

At first I thought this was so cute and funny. But this should be a thing...just saying 🤷🏻‍♀️😁
