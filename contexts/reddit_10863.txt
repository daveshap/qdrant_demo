[F17] - Feeling numb and lonely as fuck
Thanks to my fucking shyness and awkwardness I ended up being seen as a weird and retarted kid since my age of 6, when I started school. Parents were so worried about me they forced me to hang around with neighbours that didn't like me that at all. I was neglected and made fun off every since. I also had acne and poor motorics which made me ever more sadder. Now I'm in high school and a little progress happened - it seems no one cares about me, I'm in a club, looking better... But scared of future and everything. I have 0 friends, never had a bf, believing I must be very boring and aloof to actually have meaningful relationships. I'm OK with family - but I never told them I want to kill myself. I plan to visit a Halloween party at one club alone and if nothing happens I'm gonna overdose. I just wanna feel loved at once.

Update: OMG I didn't expect so many responses to come up that fast... Thank you all!
