RYAN: Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
ROBIN: I just thought it would be nice.
ADAM: Are you going to see Sam again?
ROBIN: I thought I might stop by.
RYAN: All day again?
ROBIN: Not all day. I'll be home after lunch.
ROBIN: You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
ADAM: I wanna be with you today.
ROBIN: Oh, honey. There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
ADAM: We can work.
ROBIN: Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
RYAN: Can we really help build a house?
