LUTHER: Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running! How much time does she have left?
ETHAN: Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
BILLY: Before we kill her or cure her..
LUTHER: Right.
ETHAN: Wrong. All we've got to worry about is Ambrose. Nyah will take care of Nyah.
BILLY: What are you talking about?
ETHAN: Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself. So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts.
