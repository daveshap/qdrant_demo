PEEBLES: Sir, your limo's here.
GALLAGHER: Kill me if you want. Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit. But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'. You've got a family. I'm giving you a chance to see them. I kept in touch. She never married. All these years. Maybe she loves you. I wouldn't know why.
GALLAGHER: This is a war, Wade. You against him. Vengeance time. The City's just in the way. Kill the fucker. You and me. We'll work things out when the time is right.
WADE: Remember my promise.
GALLAGHER: Don't threaten me. I tend to take these things seriously. And get a couple hours sleep. You look like day old shit.
WADE: Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
PEEBLES: You okay?
GALLAGHER: How do I look?
PEEBLES: Aces.
