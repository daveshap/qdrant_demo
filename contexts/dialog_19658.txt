NINOTCHKA: You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
LEON: And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
NINOTCHKA: Yes, it is.
LEON: I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
NINOTCHKA: Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you. As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
LEON: You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
NINOTCHKA: I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
LEON: What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Boh√®me... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction! It will cost me a franc but it is worth it. The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look.... What do you see?
NINOTCHKA: I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
LEON: It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
NINOTCHKA: So that is your house?
LEON: Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
NINOTCHKA: Does that mean that you want me to go there?
LEON: Please don't misunderstand me...
NINOTCHKA: Then you don't want me to go there.
LEON: Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
NINOTCHKA: Then why don't we go? You might be an interesting subject of study.
LEON: I will do my best.
