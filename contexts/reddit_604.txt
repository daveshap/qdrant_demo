My Mom Hates all of my girlfriends.
Hello. I don't really know how to start this but I guess I'll just do a quick rundown of who I am. My name is Noah and I'm a 16 year old honor roll student. I enjoy school, art, and like every other human romance. Recently I've been dating more often and I've been having issues with my mom. I understand why she didn't like my last ex. The last girl I dated was extremely rude and was different in text. However now I'm dating a new girl. We've been really close friends since last year, and I had my first kiss with her. She means a lot to me and I really love her. Although my mom dislikes her. The craziest part is that she has never met her. Not once. Yet she will consistently say things that hurt my feelings. Ex: "She's ugly", "she makes you have an attitude"... 

Non of this is true. At least in my opinion. I always want to improve for my girlfriend and she is a major reason for me being happy right now. Sure we have our ups and downs but I never let that get into my life after school. Yet my mother persists hauling these insults my way. 

If anyone has had a similar situation please help. I really hate my mom's disapproval for no valid reason. Even if you just heard me out I appreciate it. It feels really frustrating at some points. Thank you a million times.
