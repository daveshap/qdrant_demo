MARGO: All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw. Species unidentified. Genus: unidentified. Phylum unknown. Male
FROCK: Quadrupedal! The other name for Mbwun. He Who Walks on All Fours.""
MARGO: Nocturnal. External hair and bony plates. Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers. Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight. "External mucoid nasal glands
FROCK: So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
MARGO: With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
FROCK: Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
MARGO: And it's hungry. It's been two days since it's eaten. There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell! All those people in one enclosed space...
FROCK: It's like ringing the dinner bell.
