Probation extended because of the time of year only. What to do?
So I started a new job a few months ago in a start up company that has less than 10 employees. Now I know the environment can be quite different from a longer standing company, but I took the offer. Even though we are allowed an hour lunch, I don't think I've actually had one where I haven't made my food and sat back at my desk to continue working in the past two weeks, before that I would probably only be out for 20 or so minutes before having to come back. 

I had my probation review a couple weeks ago stating that I wasn't living up to the role and not making it my own. This is my first job in the industry and I am basically the start of the department, building the processes and creating the tools for the way things will be done, while actually learning what I am meant to do. 

I have nobody to lean on for guidance either as they don't understand my position. 

The boss was going to dismiss me, but with the time of year it is, they have given me a month extension to change things around.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel very demoralised as I have been trying my hardest to understand the role. Should I just start looking for a new job?
