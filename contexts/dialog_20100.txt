LYNETTE: Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
SID: Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
LYNETTE: If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
SID: Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
LYNETTE: Then, I'll see you around.
