How do I learn Office Politics/Optics skills as a beginner?
*crosspost from r/IWantToLearn*

I'm a very naive, trusting, and optimistic person. People who know me know that I'm incredibly honest, open, & authentic - sometimes to a fault. However, I find myself in situations where I end up "losing" in political, business, or legal situations. I am striving to not communicate in a way that gives away my motives or make emotionally transparent decisions, but I struggle with seeing how my actions will be interpreted by others.

In short, I completely lack the intuitive thinking of how to be selective with my actions for my ultimate benefit.

IWTL what kind of mindset the politically savvy have to achieve what they want, and knowing how your actions may appear to those at work, or in any "emotionally removed" environment (legal cases, general politics, business, etc.) I approach every scenario playing the hand I'm dealt, but I've observed a lot of people play the PERSON they're playing with in a natural and charismatic way (and not let their duplicity or manipulation be apparent).

Any suggestions on resources/books/etc. that can help me shift my thinking a bit?
