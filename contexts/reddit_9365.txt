A frame to put my mattress on is not a luxury but it sure feels like it.
Finally, after two years of sleeping on my mattress on the floor, I've been able to buy a platform bed for $125 at my local thrift store.  Not an easy feat because these things are hard to find!  I had to get a platform bed because there's no way I could bring a boxspring home in my tiny gas-sipping car.  A platform bed is easily dis-assembled into manageable parts that I could take home.  

I am so happy right now, feeling just a little less noticeably poor and more normal, without breaking the bank.  Thanks, fate!
