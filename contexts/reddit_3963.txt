Please see original post for the story on this.

So I (25F) asked him (37M) to be exclusive a little less than two months ago. He said yes and things were great. Over this period of time we’ve texted a lot and made a ton of effort to see each other. We actually just got back from the Hamptons this weekend. 

Well this morning after we had sex he got in the shower and left his phone unlocked. I really didn’t want to look at it but I was honestly a little suspicious but wanted to rest my nerves by hoping to see nothing. But I was wrong. Still on bumble. Texting a few other women. Even was making plans to meet up with one for a drink TONIGHT. My god I was and still am so fucking upset. I know I had to confront him.

So we’re walking to his work and I just hit him with “you know what, I really don’t like being lied to” and he said “about what?” then I said “remember when I asked to be exclusive a month and a half ago and you said yes? Why did you lie?” he then tries to put the blame on me and says “well you asked me that out of nowhere and I felt pressured to say yes” OHHHHH MY GOD what a big load of shit. I told him that if that was the case why didn’t he bring it up AT ALL within the last month and a half. He didn’t really give me an answer and just said he can’t do this right now because he’s late for work. Then I just said “whatever” and walked the fuck away. Haven’t heard from him since. 

He’s just so shocked he got caught being a shitty ass person.

And to everyone who told me in my previous post that I should have been worried, you were so right. Guess I can trust internet strangers more than this guy I’ve been with for ten months.
