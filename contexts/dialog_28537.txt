GUILD: Shut up.
NICK: You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain. The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case. Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is. Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
MIMI: Nobody told me. I did see him!
NICK: What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
MIMI: It isn't a story - it's true. I did see Wynant. He's not dead.
NICK: You're lying, Mimi. But then, you'd do anything for money. You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
MIMI: I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
NICK: Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will. Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
MACAULAY: I have no right to answer that.
NICK: What about it, Tanner. Isn't that the truth?
TANNER: That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
NICK: You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi. Mrs. Jorgensen - Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
