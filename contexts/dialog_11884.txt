RACHEL: You remember Lindsay don't you?
LINDSAY: Hi Jamie.
JAMIE: Hi.
RACHEL: You ready for some Ice Cream?
JAMIE: I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
RACHEL: But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
LINDSAY: You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
RACHEL: No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
LINDSAY: I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
RACHEL: I don't want to look pushy.
LINDSAY: You won't look pushy.
RACHEL: Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.
LINDSAY: You won't come on too strong.
RACHEL: Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
LINDSAY: Fact it Rach, you are desperate. Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
RACHEL: I don't know.
LINDSAY: Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
RACHEL: Jamie?
JAMIE: The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
RACHEL: You bet.
