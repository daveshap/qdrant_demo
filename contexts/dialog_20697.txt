LOUIS: Good God! Where'd you hear that?
ELLIE: Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
RACHEL: Honey, Church will be fine.
ELLIE: But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
RACHEL: Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
LOUIS: According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
RACHEL: That's enough of that kind of talk!
LOUIS: I just said--
RACHEL: I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
RACHEL: You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
LOUIS: And Church will be fine.
LOUIS: Well, honey...you know that...
RACHEL: Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
