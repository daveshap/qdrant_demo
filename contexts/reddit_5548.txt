So I went to college for for a long time... and have a weird resume now
So... I spent from 2006 to 2018 getting my first bachelors degree. I haven’t worked since 2010. What do I say in response to this in an interview? I want to say I focused on my family or some similar bullshit. 

Reality of my life since I know some people will gawk: I did 6 years in a frat at my first college, failed my thesis class, went home because out of state tuition was expensive, wanted to run for student government but my fraternity wasn’t at this campus, so I had found my frat at the new college to get into society so I could get elected. I finished my previous degree, got 4 years into a physics degree until I realized I couldn’t bullshit my way through differential equations and quantum physics. So I kind of graduated with just the first major after failing some upper division math courses 3 times.
