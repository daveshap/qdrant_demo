Going back to school in the fall, having trouble deciding on a safe major before I go back
So I’m 20 and I’ll be going back to school in the fall after realizing physical work isn’t ideal for me for the rest of my life. 

I’m sure this is such a cliche thing but I want to get a degree (preferably 4 years) in a safe field where I can reasonably expect to make +/- 100k after let’s say 5-7 years. I have been really into nutrition but it seems like it would be super hard to get any kind of well paying job in that field. 

I’ve been looking into coding/software engineering and it seems like one of the safer bets but any help/advice from you guys is much appreciated! Thanks
