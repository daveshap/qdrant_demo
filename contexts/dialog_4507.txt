ANTHONY: At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
BOB: Sixty days?
ANTHONY: Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
BOB: Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
ANTHONY: Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
