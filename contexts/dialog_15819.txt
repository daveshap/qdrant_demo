ELLE: Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
EMMETT: The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
ELLE: And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
EMMETT: You have Stromwell.
ELLE: Did she do that to you, too?
EMMETT: No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
ELLE: Neat.
EMMETT: Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
ELLE: Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
EMMETT: Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
EMMETT: And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
ELLE: Wow. I'm glad I met you.
