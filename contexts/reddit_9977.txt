Student loans, where do I start?
Hello! Me again! 

Posting twice in one day after being a long time lurker is weird, but I figured I’d try to ask for advice! 

I’ve completed two years of college, ( I plan on graduating with my associates in generals this December and want to transfer to a BA/BS program )  and I’ve been able to successfully pay for the whole experience with my own money, scholarships and FAFSA. 

Now, however, I’m realizing that there is next to no way to being able to pay for the university that I want to attend without taking out a good chunk of loans. I’ve let the idea of student loans scare me for such a long time, but I know that in order to go further into what I want, I need to get into a good school and take out loans. 

My request for advice is this:

-where do I start? I literally have no idea how student loans work.

-how do I take out loans? Do I need good credit? 

-do student loans only pay for school or will they help pay for housing? ( dorms, apartments, textbook, etc ) 

-do the student loans go directly to the school or me ooorrrrrrrr


Thank you all cool cats!
