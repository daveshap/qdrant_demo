KELVIN: What do you remember?
RHEYA: What do you mean?
KELVIN: Do you remember Beethoven? The Beatles? Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
RHEYA: Yes. But not until you mentioned them. As soon as you said those things, I remembered them. And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember. It's like filling up.
RHEYA: Is it a planet?
KELVIN: Not exactly. It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time. It was completely counter-intuitive. We had to unlearn everything.
RHEYA: Is it intelligent?
KELVIN: Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
RHEYA: Then it's God, right?
KELVIN: It's something.
RHEYA: You still don't believe in God?
KELVIN: The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man. Even the limits we put on it are human limits. It can do this, it can do that! It designs, it creates!
RHEYA: Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
KELVIN: You're talking about a man in a white beard again. You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human. Human beings look for causes and patterns. How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
RHEYA: But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
KELVIN: As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
RHEYA: As I said, then it's God, right?
