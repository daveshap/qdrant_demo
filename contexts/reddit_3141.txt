My wife has spent the last 5 years raising our children, what should she do now?
My wife is amazing. We decided years ago when we started having kids that she would take one for the team and fully commit to the stereotypical role of "housewife". She does the most amazing job and I value her more than she realizes. With this in mind, she's started to panic the closer we get to our children finally all entering the public school system. She never went to college and was raised in an emotionally and psychologically abusive environment growing up. With nothing but a high school diploma and a variety of retail and service job experiences to go on, I would love to hear about any suggestions or thoughts you all might have for what direction she should head in.

We've been talking about the possibility of her getting her pharmacy technician license or even looking in to becoming a medical assistant. Here's hoping you all can spark some new ideas for us!
