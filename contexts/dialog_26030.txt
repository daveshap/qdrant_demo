LENNY: Naw. She won't call me.
MAX: Just as well, Lenny. You gotta get past it. I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
LENNY: Thanks, Max. I'm touched by your concern.
MAX: I just hate to see you pining away. It makes me want to vomit, frankly. Broken hearts are for assholes.
LENNY: Hey, Iris, you okay?
