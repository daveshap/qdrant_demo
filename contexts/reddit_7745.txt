Applying for a postdoc, how long should I wait before moving on to the next?
I sent in my application docs in September, contacted the professor after three weeks (they were waiting on reference letters), then two weeks after that (was traveling that week), then last week (no response). If I'm going to get rejected that's fine, but I would really like to know so that I can send in the next application. How long is a reasonable time to wait? They're one of the top professors in the field so working with them would be amazing, but every day that I wait is another day I could be working on a different application.
