I miss intimacy
Kissing for the sake of kissing, making eye contact over a cup of coffee, sharing a joke, flirty touches. I miss all of these so much but at the same time I haven’t really met a guy that I’m interested in. I guess I’m feeling a little lonely but reluctant to date for the sake of dating. It’s cold here and I tempted to give in to online dating but sometimes a one night stand or FWB can make people feel lonelier than actually being alone. The frustration is real!

Edit: Reading all your comments made me feel a little less lonely. I know my time will come but honest to god, I wish my time will just arrive right now.
