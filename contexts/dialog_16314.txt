JESSICA: I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but -- Are you glad you didn't kill him?
LOGAN: It doesn't make any difference anymore.
JESSICA: You're really one of us now, aren't you?
LOGAN: You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you? Why did you stay with me?
JESSICA: I wanted to... ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
LOGAN: I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
JESSICA: Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
LOGAN: I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit. I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
JESSICA: For us.
