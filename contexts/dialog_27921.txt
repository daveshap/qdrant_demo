KIKI: Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith. I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
GALBRAITH: I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
KIKI: Thanks.
GALBRAITH: Well, I'd best be off.
JERRY: I want to ask you something.
JERRY: It's about the leopard.
GALBRAITH: You're worrying about its killing someone else?
JERRY: Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
GALBRAITH: Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
JERRY: You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
GALBRAITH: No. I'm quite sure.
GALBRAITH: There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
JERRY: That's right, of course.
GALBRAITH: Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
