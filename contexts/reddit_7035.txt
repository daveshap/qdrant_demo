Unemployed for 6 months and now for the first time starting as a bank teller! I need your tips!
Just like everyone else I had no clue what I was doing with my life and enrolled in an arts related post secondary institution that only year and a half later left me with a useless diploma and 35 grand in debt. Then life happened... depression and all... I had nothing to celebrate for about 6 months and only a month ago I realized I couldn’t let that be the rest of my life and I started looking for a job. Wasn’t easy but hey, what is? Long story short I’m gonna be starting as a part time bank teller at a local bank where I’ve expressed my interest in growing within the company. They were quick to let me know they would be happy to assist me! However I’ve never worked at a bank before, but I really want to make this a career. Anyone who’s worked as a bank teller please share any tips on how I can do better, get noticed and work my way up. I’m willing to work and study as hard as necessary, but I need someplace to start. Would appreciate any help from you guys <3
