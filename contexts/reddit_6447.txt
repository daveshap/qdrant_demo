Medical tech startup has no Glassdoor presence despite being several years old--red flag?
I'm going through the interview process at a medical tech startup that's been around for a few years (between 3-8 years). It seems to have a viable product used by actual hospitals, a professional website with pictures of a couple dozen or so staff (wearing company swag, so it's not a stock photo), and mentions in legitimate, non-PR publications, so I was surprised that it had no Glassdoor presence whatsoever. Not just a profile with one review, or no reviews, but not even a presence, despite the job also being listed on Glassdoor--is this common? Something to be suspicious of? Every other job I've been looking at seems to have a presence.
