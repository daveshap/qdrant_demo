Send system mail Ubuntu 18.04 Hello I have looked at many different guides on the web for how to send system mail to my gmail from ubuntu 18.04 in case of problems on the device / server - But can't find a simple guide that i think makes sense? Someone who has some advice?I don't want to set up a mail server but keep it as simple as possible when I'm a beginner. If I could use google smtp server to do that it would be an advantage rather than having to mess with my own domain :)
