Can anyone tell me where to find/dig in order to find: gold, diamond etc.. in Minecraft? I\u2019m asking this because, I want to know where to dig in order to find precious metals and stones.Q-1: Do they regenerate?Q-2: Where to look for precious materials? Because, I want to find cool, diamond, gold etc... and to know whether they regenerate or not so that I can be near to them. Because now, it\u2019s hard for me to find precious metals and diamond in Minecraft. I mean, when I find gold on a rock somewhere and by mistake I lost them, then I must find another place to look for it.
