LUCY: Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
LINDA: Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
LUCY: Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
LINDA: It doesn't seem right.
LUCY: Please, as a favour to me? So I won't be the only girl?
