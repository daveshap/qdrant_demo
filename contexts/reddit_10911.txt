i hate how i actually have a decent life and i still despise myself
i struggle to relate with the stories of people with actual depression struggling to get out of bed, have a shower, and do basic tasks. they often talk about how socially isolated they are, how they don't have any friends or family to turn to. 

i hate how i hate myself and how unhappy i am despite being none of the above. i actually have great friends and loving parents and im sure if i were to open up to them they would 100% listen to me and help me through my sadness. that's the worst part; i don't want anyone worrying about me. it would break my heart to think that my parents and friends, in the back of their minds, are constantly worrying about whether or not im going to kill myself.  

do you know how many late night texts ive drafted? how many times ive lied in bed crying myself to sleep, wishing desperately that i could tell someone how much i hate living? 

i don't even know what i want anymore. i have skills and hobbies. im doing well in school. i have meaningful relationships. it's like somewhere along my life, the part of me that could be happy left my side. i could have everything in the world, but ill never have self satisfaction.
