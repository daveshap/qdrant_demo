Whats my age again?
So I have been dating my boyfriend for 2.5 years, we have been talking about moving in together.  We both have pretty crazy work schedules and I live about 15-20 min away.  He will be going into residency and I have a full-time job at a hospital.  My mother is rather religious but not that ridiculous about relationships and such but I was still scared to talk with her and let her know of our plans (which are projecting for a year from now). 

I finally got the courage to talk to her today and she basically told me she would never support it unless we were married and that is the only way she would approve of it.  She told me my reason for wanting to move in with him is not valid (I actually want to see him on a day to day basis and I live at his apartment 95% of my life regardless). My apartment is a glorified storage unit. 

She also knows how much I respect her and value her opinion, she has saved me from making huge life mistakes when I was younger and I know she has a lot of experience and great things to teach me.  However, this is something I feel so strongly about for the first time I want more then caring about what she thinks.  I have every intention of marrying my boyfriend but not just as an excuse to live with him so my mom can sleep at night.  Everyone tells me just do it and she will get over it, but I have never been the one to just do things if I know I will be going against someone that has had a huge role in my life.

TL;DR: I am 24 with a full-time job, a good salary, great insurance, but am scared to go against my controlling mothers wishes of me not moving in with my boyfriend.
