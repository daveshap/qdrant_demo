SUPERGIRL: It's lovely. . .
ZALTAR: No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
SUPERGIRL: Are you happy, Zaltar?
ZALTAR: What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
SUPERGIRL: But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
