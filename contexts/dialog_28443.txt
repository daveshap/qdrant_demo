NAULS: What you doin'?
BLAIR: Nobody's getting in here. You can tell them all that!
NAULS: Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
NAULS: Now why'd you go and...
BLAIR: And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it. I know what you're up to. Don't think I don't. And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope. I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
NAULS: You promise?
