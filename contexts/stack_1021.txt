simulate geographic distance between servers I want to simulate geographic distance, so I need to add delay to each receive/transfer package.<br/>I read that squid could help me find what I'm looking for, however, playing with its configuration haven't given me the right results.<br/>If I'm pinging from my own PC to squid server I'm getting ~0.5 time, it's okay (would prefer ~1 time)<br/>If I'm pinging between servers it's only ~0.255 timeI would be glad to get help finding the optimal solution for bad traffic.Squid: Version 3.5.12<br/>OS: Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
