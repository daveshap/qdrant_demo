Is there any use for the hand that you find in the guest house? Early on in the game, while in the guest house, you can find a hand on the floor and are able to pick it up.Is there any use for this hand at all? What is the point of being able to pick it up?Spoiler to help clarify exactly what I mean:<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   The hand I refer to is your own severed hand, that Mia chops off with the chainsaw. Once you get up you can pick it up from the floor nearby. I can also confirm that regardless of if you pick it up or not, it will still get re-attached the same way later in the game.</blockquote>
