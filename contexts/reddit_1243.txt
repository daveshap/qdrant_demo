Anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety?
It’s a very specific kind of upset stomach that I get from my anxiety. It’s not a stomachache, or cramping, or “maybe I ate something bad”, it’s literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I’ve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I’ve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it’s likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don’t understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn’t change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don’t even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don’t need to be told that I need medication or therapy. I’m just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. No, taking a tums isn’t going to fix it. No, I can’t just “stop worrying”, or drink some damn ginger tea. I know a lot of suggestions come from a good place, but they don’t help.
