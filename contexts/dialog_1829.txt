KIRKEBY: So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
BUD: So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
SHELDRAKE: I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
BUD: Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will. Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
BUD: Well -- I guess so.
SHELDRAKE: You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
BUD: Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
SHELDRAKE: No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
BUD: Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
