Could a President declare a National Emergency for the climate change?
I saw that there is a thread going right now for a similar question regarding "gun control"- but my understanding from that thread is that Gun Control is more of a legislative issue than a funding issue, and that National Emergencies primarily give the authority to maneuver funds around, not create laws.

My question is whether or not a President could legally declare a national emergency on climate change and then proceed to divert budgetary funding towards things like green technology, and away from things like oil drilling and military spending on tanks and humvees.

My last post was automatically removed because I neglected to provide a source- so here's an article that says Oregon Congressman Earl Blumenauer has suggested the idea:
