What is best Ubuntu for multiple usage? Hello Guys and/or Gals,I am new to the site and after searching it for a few hours i finally decided to sign up as i have some questions.I have a Windows 8.1 system and I would like to install Linux on it in VMware OS. I have never tried Linux before so I thought i would ask what is best version of Linux to run in VMware?I want to use it for rendering graphics, storage, teamspeak and other software.I do not want a dual boot system which is why I have vmware as I do not want it full time at this point.I also want to learn more about linux as when my windows 8.1 pc dies I will need a new os, and i am done with windows at that point.So is Ubuntu the best choice and is there only one version to choose from?Think that is all my questions for now.Thanks in advanceValshardreg
