DOUG: You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
HENRY: Ah, so what?
DOUG: That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
DOUG: Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
HENRY: How?
DOUG: I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
HENRY: A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
DOUG: You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
HENRY: What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
DOUG: Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
HENRY: I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
DOUG: Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
HENRY: There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
DOUG: Deal!
HENRY: And take Jiri with you?
DOUG: What for?
HENRY: Insurance!
