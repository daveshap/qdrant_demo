MICKEY: Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
HANNAH: Huh?
MICKEY: ...a little, uh, hey! A little hug! What is this? Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
MICKEY: How is everything?
HANNAH: Everything's good. Everything's fine.
MICKEY: Yeah? Yeah? Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
HANNAH: Here, you guys. Open them up.
MICKEY: Let me get a little reaction here. How's Elliot?
HANNAH: He's fine.
MICKEY: Yeah?
HANNAH: Oh, you know what? I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
MICKEY: Oh!
HANNAH: I think he'll find that satisfying.
MICKEY: Really? That'll be terrific for him, I think.
HANNAH: I think so.
MICKEY: I like him. I think he's a sweet guy.
HANNAH: Yeah.
MICKEY: The few times that I've met him... Isn't that a great mitt?
