MBA Question
Hi Guys,

I have recently been juggling whether or not to get my MBA. Here's my situation:

I am in my early 20's graduated with my bachelors in finance about 3-4 years ago after graduating early. For the past 3-4 years I have been in and out of accounting to finance positions. Currently I work in a senior accounting position managing a department of 3 (non-staff accountants, not an accounting manager). My short-term/Medium term goal right now is to work as a senior financial analyst in a medium to large size company, or an accounting manager (upward progression). Eventually I would want to be head of corporate valuations or a controller/CFO. Would 100% like to stay corporate and non-bank, I like my work life balance.

I recently came across an opportunity to go back and get my MBA with a concentration in Finance. Not a top 10 school however AACSB accredited, and a lot cheaper. The MBA in finance would kill two birds with one stone for me, as I need 3 more classes that I can't afford to be eligible for my CPA, plus the MBA part would be great too.

Currently I have around 20k in debt from my bachelors. This is not overwhelming in any means, and very manageable. After grants, scholarships etc. I would be looking to add another 20k to my debt in order to finish the whole masters program.

I'm kind of yo-yoing back and forth as to whether or not this would be worth taking on the new debt. I realize top 10 schools would be better for job, networking all that, however it's just simply out of my means as it stands right now.

Would this be a reasonable decision to go? Just looking for some advice and wise words from all you more experienced working class.

Thank you in advance!
