How do you break the cycle of bad jobs while you're still unemployed?
One job is better than no job, and it’s easier to find a better job if you’re already working.

But if you're not working, how do you prevent taking yet another bad job to plug the gap? Taking a bad job to stop unemployment just seems to be backtracking your steps if you have been in that situation before. I don't need backtracking or repetition.
