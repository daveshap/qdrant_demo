MOSS: Why would he go to Odessa?
WELLS: To kill your wife.
MOSS: Maybe he should be worried. About me.
WELLS: He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
WELLS: ...You didn't take the product, did you?
MOSS: What product.
WELLS: The heroin. You don't have it.
MOSS: No I don't have it.
WELLS: No. You don't.
WELLS: ...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells. Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
MOSS: If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
WELLS: No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
MOSS: He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
