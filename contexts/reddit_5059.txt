Responding to job application rejection letters is worth it!!!
I'm literally over-the-moon right now!

My wife and I recently relocated, and finding a steady job in this area's market has been scarce. I've got plenty of experience in my field but I only got accepted for two job offers that paid really low and the commute was far away. One company that's much closer and pays much better posted a job and to my surprise, I didn't get it. I received a very generic email saying:

"Dear applicant, unfortunately, we've decided to hire another candidate to fill our position for JOB at ABC company. We've greatly appreciated your time and cooperation during the interview process and we will keep you in mind for future considerations."

When I opened this email, my heart sank to the floor. Against my better judgment, I sent an email reply stating how great the experience was and I asked what I could've improved upon during the process. I also thanked them for future considerations. Crickets. No response by email. Nothing. Almost a week later, my phone rings and it's the recruiting manager who I interviewed with. One of their employees was going on mat leave and they were willing to have me work alongside her before she left for a year. The best part is that they're hiring me permanent full-time... no contract, baby! Signed my offer letter and I start next week. Always take the high road and never give up!!
