Preparations for Thesis Writing
Hi good people! Looking for advice when it comes for preparing for thesis writing. Semester starts next week, and I've been gathering up literature to narrow down my research topics that I'm interested on. Other than this, do you have any other preparations that you did when you were in my position? (P.S. Quirky answers are fine!)
