PSA: Juniors, Apply Early Action!
I thought I was some sort of genius deciding to get a few extra months to work on and perfect my apps (aka procrastinate) by applying only regular decision, turns out I'm just a clown :(

ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡ğŸ¤¡

Now I have to wait 2-3 months before actually knowing if I got into any colleges I want to go to while most of my friends either know where they're going already or have already committed to their ED schools. So guys, spare yourself the stress, apply EA! Thank God my safety sent me a surprise early acceptance or else I would be stressed as hell.
