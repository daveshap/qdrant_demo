I came up short 32 dollars over the last two days at work
I work at Jack at the Box (maybe not after tomorrow) and somehow I came up short 19 dollars on Saturday and today (Monday) I came up short 13 dollars and I'm so worried about being fired and I'm probably rightly so. I even received a note today saying I was short 19 on Saturday and that at any time the company may terminate my employment. I just learned that at the end of my shift and then, I came up short 13.


A lot of my plans rely on me having this job and having a steady income. I feel so depressed and frustrated. I almost cried when I realized I might be fired. I'm going in the morning to talk to my manager but it isn't a guarantee that I'll have a job. Fuck.
