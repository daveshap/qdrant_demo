is it weird if you feel like you don’t like anybody but still try to please them?
i’m really confuse right now. i could hate someone so much that i wished they’d disappear, but 10 seconds later, i found myself tried my best to make them happy.

 i don’t get along with my ‘best friend’ as much as i used to do and it’s seem like i am the only one who feel this way. i am an asshole. i’ve talked behind her back with probably everybody in our group of friend and most of them agree with me. tbh she is very mean and every time we told her that, she just laughed then brushed it off. but i don’t know if she knows that we talk shit about her and sometimes i feel kinda guilty. and i don’t know why but i have a feeling that i am afraid of her. our relationship is not equal (is that how you describe it??). i have always have an advantage but i am the one who feel 
insecure, like why?

for some reasons i cannot give up my friendship with her (we have know each others for 5 years). no matter how much i hate her, i still find myself try to please her. wtf is wrong with me??

should i distance myself away from her? should i have a talk with her? i’ve even thought about changing school and told my dad about it. i don’t know what to do? i don’t even understand myself. help!
