BROTHER EARL: Brother Minister, what is wrong?
MALCOLM: The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
BROTHER EARL: Let's cancel.
MALCOLM: Is my family here yet?
BROTHER EARL: Down front as always.
