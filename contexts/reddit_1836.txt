Rejection from a top school...
Dear Applicant,

Thank you for your interest in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

The Admissions Committee has carefully considered your application and we regret to inform you that we will not be able to offer you admission in the entering class of 2020, or a position on one of our alternate lists. This year's application pool was the strongest in the School’s history, and we are unable to offer admission to every student. 

Normally, we would state that this decision has no reflection on your abilities; however, there is a first time for everything. As stated on our website, we have geographic boundaries, and we normally do not allow admission to those residing outside of Britain. However, as your parents are British, we decided to consider your application. We would recommend that next time you state your relationship to the English, you do not write that your “grandfather was a famous British man who hid his gun up his butt to hide the fact he was a criminal.” 

We also would like to remind you that Hogwarts is a school for eleven to seventeen-year-olds. We do allow transfers, but not for last years. We certainly did not appreciate that you stated that you were fifteen when you are actually eighteen. Furthermore, you were extremely inappropriate during your interview, as you attempted to kiss Professor Granger. Professor Granger certainly did not enjoy it when you ran out of the coffee shop yelling “it’s legal!”

Lastly, the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a school for people with magical abilities. Although it was entertaining watching the clip, we regret to inform you that waving a branch at a potato connected to a moving fan whilst screaming “levitate!” is not magic.

We greatly appreciate your interest in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and offer our best wishes of success as you pursue your educational goals.

Yours Sincerely,

Minerva McGonagall

Deputy Headmaster
