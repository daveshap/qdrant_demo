CHARLOTTE: Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
IGOR: Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
CHARLOTTE: No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
IGOR: Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
CHARLOTTE: But it was really my fault.
IGOR: And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault ... While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
CHARLOTTE: I'd love to.
CHARLOTTE: Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
IGOR: It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create. My footing is not too secure.
