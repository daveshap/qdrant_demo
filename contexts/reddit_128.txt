Can't figure this girl out
This feels weird to ask the internet for help, so bare with me here. Im a Junior in Highschool with one week till the school year is over. Over the past two months I've been partying, and hooking up with this other Junior. Just recently we started texting each other. I'm beginning to like her a lot more, and am definitely stumped on whether or not she even likes me back. I've been lightly flirtatious since I don't want to completely blow this up if in fact she doesn't like me. 

I have asked her to go out and grab something to eat with me, but since she has been studying to take her SAT today, she denied my offer but replied with "I would definitely want to go however..." It's also hard to ask her to do other activities since we have finals this coming week. 

We both don't struggle to force conversations when we texts, it happens fluidly. However we both take a while to reply. Most likely because I am a slow replier. It is clear that she likes talking to me, but it's hard to tell if she would want anything more. So what do you guys think? Does she like me, or not?
