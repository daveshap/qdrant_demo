FISHER: Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
IKE: What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
FISHER: Vindication. How would you like to get some? A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
IKE: The real story on Miss Carpenter.
FISHER: All the gory details.
IKE: The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
FISHER: It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
IKE: This is good. It is a good story, Fish.
FISHER: If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true. All accurate.
IKE: Okay, you were right. I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
FISHER: Then you've got it. If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
IKE: Paid vindication" That's what I call justice."
FISHER: Justice, yes. Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
IKE: But I'll get my normal fee, right?
