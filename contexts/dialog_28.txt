CAMERON: You got something on your mind?
BIANCA: I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
CAMERON: You have my word. As a gentleman
BIANCA: You're sweet.
CAMERON: How do you get your hair to look like that?
BIANCA: Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
