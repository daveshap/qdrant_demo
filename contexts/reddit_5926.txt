Should I Quit my Master Program as an Engineer and work at Amazon
So im 8 weeks into my masters program as an engineer and finally got a job but it requires me to quit school. Should i quit school and go for this engineer job or just continue school and get my master degree. The thing is i work at amazon for two days which sucks and its part time. But at school i go for two days. And it just so happens that both work and school land on one day the same day which requires me to leave one of them. I have some work experience but not as much as this big company. But im also wanting this master degree since im 8 weeks into it and invested in it which makes me have to drop out.

Edit: thank you guys. Alot of great response. I think most of you guys choose school. I will continue this path.
