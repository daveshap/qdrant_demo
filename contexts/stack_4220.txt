Requesting help with physiological merfolk concept The concept I have is merfolk that don't breath underwater and preserve a very human appearance from the waist up.  I need to keep human (or at least very human-like) hair, skin, andeyesight in them.Hearing and olfactory sense should be prioritised to life abovewater, through it would be nice if it worked to some extent in thesea.    I just need the hair to look somewhat pretty with long silk hair,not bald or with messed up hair.I'm aware that hair makes drag as does the human shape in general and that is fine, so it should swim fine anyhow, right? Breath holding: it would also be preferred if they could hold their breath for long periods of time like dolphin's 8 to 10 minutes, rather than the human average of 2 minutes.
