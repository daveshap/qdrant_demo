LM324 with arduino as a differentiator for phototransistor signal I want to measure the rate of change of voltage with respect to time coming out of a phototransistor, and preferably amplify it at same time, as the change is not so significant. But lets just not making it complicated! I am totally a newbie! Is it possible doing it with Rail to rail op amps and arduino? Lm324 can do that?If somebody can provide me with a schematic, it will mean everything to me.Thanx
