HELEN: Stephen, what are you doing here?
STEPHEN: Fixing my roof.
HELEN: It's not your roof anymore.
STEPHEN: Where's Sean?
HELEN: He's got piano lessons.
STEPHEN: Oh yeah? How's he doing?
HELEN: He's going to be a fireman.
STEPHEN: Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
HELEN: Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
STEPHEN: I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
HELEN: -- You remember.
STEPHEN: Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
HELEN: The great communicator.
STEPHEN: Sorry I hit Jackson.
HELEN: He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
STEPHEN: He treats you okay?
HELEN: Okay.
STEPHEN: I treated you better.
HELEN: You treated me like shit.
HELEN: You want some coffee?
STEPHEN: Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
HELEN: What's wrong, Stephen? C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind. How's Brian doing?
STEPHEN: He's out.
HELEN: I know he's out, but how's he doing?
STEPHEN: Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
HELEN: Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
STEPHEN: Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
HELEN: Yeah? When was the last time?
STEPHEN: In a fire? Never. Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
HELEN: You can't keep being his father...
