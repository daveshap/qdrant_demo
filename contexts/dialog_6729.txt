LI: Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence. My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
YU: Not everything is an illusion. My hand... wasn't that real?
LI: Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.
LI: Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
YU: To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
LI: You're right, but I don't know what to do. I want to be with you... just like this. It gives me a sense of peace.
