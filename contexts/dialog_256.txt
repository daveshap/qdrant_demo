CATES: Yeah.
HAMMOND: It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
CATES: Okay, let's get down to it. I did my part and got you out. So now you tell me where we're goin'?
HAMMOND: Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit. We go to him right away.
CATES: Luther was part of the gang?
HAMMOND: What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
CATES: I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
HAMMOND: Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
CATES: I don't give a damn. It happens to be my name.
HAMMOND: Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
CATES: I may call you worse than that.
HAMMOND: Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
CATES: Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
HAMMOND: Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
CATES: I'm helpin' you, huh?
