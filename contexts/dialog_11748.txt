ANNIE: Oh, I don't know...
FRANK: Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
DIANE: They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
FRANK: It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
TOM: I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
ANNIE: Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
TOM: That's up to Pilgrim.
