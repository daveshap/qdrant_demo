ELIZABETH: You just said very food.
BARRY: Did I say that?
WALTER: Yeah.
BARRY: That was weird. I meant good.
WALTER: Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
ELIZABETH: You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
BARRY: Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
ELIZABETH: She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
BARRY: No.
ELIZABETH: You look nervous.
BARRY: I'm not, I'm very happy.
