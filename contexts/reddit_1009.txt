UPDATE TO: This past weekend, I overcame my anxiety and decided to shoot my shot: I asked out a guy I have a huge crush on and he said yes!! We're going out to get coffee soon ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜Š
Unfortunately, getting coffee isn't going to happen as he is currently talking to another girl and said she wouldn't be too happy with him getting coffee with another girl \*sigh\* **ğŸ˜’** **ğŸ˜’** 

I'm glad he told me even though I'm disappointed and I very much respect him, so hopefully we can be friends or something (because I really really like him and think he's super cool) so yeah... that's a thing...
