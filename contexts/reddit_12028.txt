I am too sad to eat.
My boyfriend cheated on me with a girl who has repeatedly stolen 2 other of my boyfriends. He admitted to me and his sexual intentions with her.

I'm really upset.
Last week he gave me diet pills to help me lose weight.
This was before I found out.

I've been serious about fitness.
But I'm scared.


I'm so sad I don't even want to eat.
But I can't be left hungry.


I keep hearing that I'm strong and that girl and my now ex boyfriend are not worth it. But it's reaaally hard to see that.

Me not eating is just started last night.
Help?
