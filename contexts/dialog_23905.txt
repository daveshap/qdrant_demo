EMMETT: I haven't done anything.
LANGSTON: I want you out of town before the hanging.
EMMETT: I'll be long gone.
JAKE: You mean you ain't coming with Emmett and me?
PADEN: I can't say I'm convinced you're going anywhere.
JAKE: Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
PADEN: I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
JAKE: Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
PADEN: The other guy drew first.
JAKE: Right!
