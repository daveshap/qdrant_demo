Employer Forcing People Out - How to respond?

I work at a very small recruiting firm and was furloughed along with a few other coworkers due to Covid. A few weeks ago, because of the PPP loan, we were brought back. Since then leadership at my company seems to be doing everything they can to force people to quit, and this has escalated as we slowly transition back to the office this week. A few examples:
- If we are not “productive” enough or if we break any of the new procedures we will be sent home without pay for 14 days
- CEO outlined mask requirement in his plan but offline said he doesn’t care if we wear them or not. Also told us we are forcing ourselves back into the office because we failed at working from home
- I asked questions about the mask policy, what we’d do if someone becomes sick, etc. and received a link to the CDC as a response
- A coworker has an autoimmune disease and has been going into the office - they were asked if they’d prefer to just resign since that would be easier for the company 
- I asked to take PTO today instead of going into the office and was also asked the same question over the phone

Overall, I don’t know what to do. They’ve created a stressful, toxic environment that’s hard to deal with. I don’t want to get forced out but don’t know what to when it feels like they have all the power. At this point I’m just trying to wait til June when the funds will run out and they’ll probably lay me off. Until then, any advice? 

TL;DR - my employer is creating policies and procedures to force folks to quit so they won’t have to pay for unemployment or have to pay back the PPP loan.
