FREDDY: Cold! Cold and dead!
IGOR: You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
FREDDY: Don't try to cheer me up that way.
IGOR: Well, I don't like to see you mope.
IGOR: You'll be getting me sad next.
FREDDY: I'm sorry. I don't mean to take out my frustration on you. You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
IGOR: I'm not that sort you know. I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.
FREDDY: You're right! Self-pity never got anyone anywhere. Let's go back and finish our dinner.
