Odd request for advice.
18 M here. 

I remember this girl from my childhood who i dont kw right now and would like to meet. I wanna try a way to find her and the only info i have is the school we both used to attend. Literally, no names from any other person who used to go there since i moved away after attending for 1 year. Any ideas on how i could find her??
