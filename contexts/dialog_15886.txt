JACK: Are we here?
GUMP: Aye. That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells. Oona... lure her out. Play the part of a girl-child.
JACK: What do I do?
GUMP: Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
GUMP: Here now. Toss her this when you've the chance. Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass. She's terribly vain. Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
JACK: And if she thinks me a liar?
GUMP: Fie on what she thinks! You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
