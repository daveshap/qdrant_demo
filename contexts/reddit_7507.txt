Take advantage of pass/fail? Any downsides?
Hello,

I am a first year masters student, and my university just switched to optional pass/fail grading. You can select which classes to choose this grading option for by the end of the last regular week of the semester (before finals week). I have a 3.90 cumulative GPA, and I would ideally like to bolster it. At the moment there is only one course I am concerned about, and I’ll have a better picture of it when the deadline approaches. I will probably not go on for a PhD afterwards, but I’ve entertaining the idea and would like to keep that door open. Would there be any downside to strategically choosing which classes to change the grading option for?

Thank you
