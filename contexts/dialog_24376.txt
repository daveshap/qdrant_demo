CLAYTON: Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
BANDIT: Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
CLAYTON: You.
BANDIT: Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
CLAYTON: You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
BANDIT: Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
