DOUG: What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
CHRIS: Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
DOUG: Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
CHRIS: How to make a buck!
DOUG: Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
CHRIS: Because it's in English?
DOUG: Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
CHRIS: But we are underground?
DOUG: No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
KATKA: Why don't you read something after the break? DOUG What here? Weren't you listening to what I just said?
KATKA: You used to read.
DOUG: Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap.
