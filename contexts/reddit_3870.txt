Hey boys, why do this?
Why say that you like someone, say that you see a future with someone, but never want to just hangout, ask questions, or plan something?

Why even say it if you have no intention of following through? Why keep sending “good morning” texts if you can’t be bothered to keep up the conversation at all?

It’s not as if you’re keeping me on the hook. I’ve already told you I don’t like this and would rather just be friends - yet you persist that you like me and want to build something..

Build what?? Silence??
