Ever wake up every morning and you want to die?
My depression as constantly began to get worse and worse. It’s been years since my last suicide attempt and I was supposed to try again this year. But then I got a girlfriend, she loves for me cares for me and makes me feel great when we are together. But, even thought we live together I hardly get to see her because she works days and I work graveyard, so when I get home she has to leave. I see here a total of maybe 10 hours a work week. And all those hours I’m away I feel like nothing has changed since before I met her. I go into such deep depressions that I feel like my heart could stop at any moment (wouldn’t be opposed to it anyway). I’m scared to die, but I’m not scared of being dead. The only time I’m happy without her is if I smoke and that last a couple hours tops. I don’t know why I’m so sad. Plenty of people have it way worse then me and somehow they are happy without effort. I have it made, good job, love of my life, a place to lay me head at the end of the night. Sadness overwhelms me almost daily, I’ve tried everything I can. I wake up ever morning and wish I hadn’t. Living seems like an endless battle that I can’t win.  Everyone thinks I’m joking when I tell them I want to die, but honestly that’s the most truthful thing to ever leave my mouth. Anyone else have the same problem?
