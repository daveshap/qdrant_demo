Uk based 30-year-old embarrassed and ashamed of my art degree, I want to try and make something of myself but unsure what that is, looking for some help?
I got an art degree a couple of years ago. God knows what I was thinking ! for years I have been struggling with guilt over it watching all the other grads with tech and finance go onto great well-paid careers that see them well in the future. Well I have been in lockdown struggling on little money I have and finally decided enough is enough I want to change my life and make something of myself but I am unsure of what to do. I am looking for advice from people who were in similar positions and made a break out into something with a good salary and future prospects.
