I wish someone would shoot me to death.
This morning my dad went on a rant about how people who don't add anything to society should die. All I could think about is how that's just me. I'm useless. I'm unwanted. I might not be a convicted criminal, but I'm definitely never going to be useful to society. 

I don't agree with him in any other case, but in my case... Yeah. I should be killed. 

I can't get enough courage to do it myself, but I still very much want it to happen. 

I can't see a day when I'll not be like this. Useless and suicidal. These are just two things that I'm meant to be. I don't want to be them, but here I am. 

Kill me please.
