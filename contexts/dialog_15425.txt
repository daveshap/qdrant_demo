PETER: Yes?
CALLER: Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds. It's check, Peter.
PETER: Let me speak to my daughter.
CALLER: She's in the other room. I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
PETER: Please... wait.
CALLER: The game's over. You lost.
PETER: It's me you want. Not her.
CALLER: No. As usual you're wrong. It is her I want. Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
PETER: That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley? His play is always fair and just.""
CALLER: You're groping. I have been fair. It's my move now.
PETER: I'll give you anything you want. Anything! Please!
CALLER: Don't beg, Peter. She has to die. I can't win unless she dies.
CALLER: I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
PETER: No! Wait!!
