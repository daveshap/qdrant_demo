LEE: She's just standing around -- not doing much.
CARTER: Just don't fall asleep. Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
LEE: I'll try to stay awake. It's so boring.
LEE: Slow down, baby.
CARTER: What did you say?
LEE: Nothing. I said nothing.
LEE: Is it hot in here?
CARTER: Hot? I'm freezing my ass off.
LEE: I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice. You want some ice?
CARTER: What's going on?
LEE: She's getting undressed.
CARTER: Gimme the binoculars.
LEE: No. It's not right.
CARTER: Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
LEE: What's she doing?
CARTER: Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
LEE: I don't want to hear this.
CARTER: Skirt just came off. She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
LEE: Snoopy? I love Snoopy.
CARTER: She just took her hair down. Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands. You better get that ice.
