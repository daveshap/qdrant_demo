ERIN: What kind of person lives like this? Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
GEORGE: It's a simple thing. Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
ERIN: I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator. I can't afford one. God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>. I got fired.
GEORGE: What? But you been working so hard --
ERIN: Doesn't matter. Doesn't make one bit of difference. Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
GEORGE: You're not nothing, Erin.
ERIN: Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be. I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect. I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes. Did I tell you that? You live next door to a real live beauty queen. I still got the tiara. I kept it cause I thought it meant something. I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life. I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
GEORGE: You are someone.
ERIN: No I'm not. Look at me. I'm not.
GEORGE: You're someone to me. You're someone real special to me.
