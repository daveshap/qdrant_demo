Professor here, if you have missed class, please come back. We aren’t mad at you.
Hello, I’ve read a lot of posts recently about folks missing classes and feeling too anxious to come back. Don’t worry. We would much rather you come back to our classes than continue to miss. We teach because we care about you individually. We care about what’s going on in your lives. I know it’s easy to see professors as these omnipresent overlords but know that we are human and we have definitely been in your position before. Please feel better and know that you are always welcome back into class. Just shoot us an email and let us know what’s up so we can help you make up the work you missed.
