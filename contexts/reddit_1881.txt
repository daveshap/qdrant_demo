Do you guys fear for the next generation?
Ppl will be studying calc in like 2nd grade and getting USAMO 7 years in a row from 6th grade onwards. Kids will be like “dad I want to get into Stanford” but we’ll have to be like “sorry it’s not as great as 30 years ago they only accept 2 ppl a year.”

That plus global warming and all lmao
