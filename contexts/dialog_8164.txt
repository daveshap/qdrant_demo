EXLEY: It's a suicide note. Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
BUD: He had help getting up there. Two of his fingers are broken.
EXLEY: We had one thing figured wrong. I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
BUD: At least not anymore.
EXLEY: Patchett's dead. He sent you after me. I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
BUD: <u>Lynn</u>.
