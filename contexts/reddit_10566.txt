It is my birthday today and it is a huge milestone for me. :)
About a month ago, I was sure I was going to die by suicide pretty soon, and I was sad that I wouldn't make it until my birthday. But here I am right now, I am really proud of myself for making it this far and my depression is finally starting to pass. Thank you all.
