Save megabucks by learning to make your top 5 store-bought foods from scratch
Last December i had to attend this shitty companywide sales thing. I did pick up one key nugget: The top 5 snacks people consume make up 80% of their snackfood spending.

I go home, I look at my grocery lists, and sure enough, my top 5 snacks were easily over 80%of my snack spending.  I'm not excessive... but it adds up!

So i learned to make my top 5 snacks. Its stupid cheap! Rice Krispies = dead easy and cheap! Especially since i bought in bulk, stupid cheap.
Nature valley bars: stupid easy to make at home, AND better tasting, and deadly cheap!
Hummus: another stupid easy and cheap one. Under $0.25 for an entire week's worth of the stuff.

Anyway, my grocery tab is down by a lot.

I don't need to learn how to make EVERYTHING. I just learned to make the stuff I'm buying the most and that's good enough.

HONEY BAR WITH OATS RECIPE aka Nature Valley knockoff bars:


* 2 cup of old fashioned oats
* additional, but SEPARATE 0.5 CUPS of old fashioned oats
* 0.25 cups of honey
* 0.25 cups of coconut oil
* 0.5 cups of whatever dry fruit or nuts you want
* 0.5 tsp of baking soda
* 1.0 tsp vanilla extract

---
Take the separate 0.5 cup of rolled oats and put them, dry, in a blender or food processor until it looks like flour. Once at a flour-like texture, add the baking soda and blend for a few second to bake sure its mixed in.

Mix this 0.5 cup of "oat flour" into the 2 cups of old fashioned oats. Take a big spoon and really be sure its as even as you can get it.

Add the honey and coconut oil. Then stir until ita like a dryish cookie dough kind of texture.

Put parchment paper onto a cookie sheet. Then use your hands to get the mix into as flat a sheet you want the bars to be.

Put this into a 350Â° preheated oven for 20-30 mins.

Once you take it out, let it cool for like... 10 minutes. Then cut it into bars BEFORE it cools completely.

These do well in foodsaver bags if you want to make a bunch of them all at once and store for later.
