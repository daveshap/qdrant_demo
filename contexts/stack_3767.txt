N-Urns N-Color ball modelling as Markov Chain I am trying to model a system which can, mostly, be simplified to elements of different groups changing groups among themselves. I want to understand how frequently the elements change group and how frequently they stay in the same group (after a large number of interactions). My initial idea was to treat it as a Ehrenfest urn problem with N-Urns and N-Colors (the initial group). A ball after being selected can change urn or stay in the same.For example (with N=2), all the red balls start in urn 1 and all the blue balls in urn 2 (the number of blue and red balls is not necessary the same). Select randomly a ball, for example a red one from urn 1 and it can move to urn 2 with probability p (or stay with 1-p).In my problem, I have the final state of the urns (after enough time for mixing) and try to find the transition matrix(ces) based on that.However, I can't seem to find any source with anything that looks like my problem. All the cases I see are, in general, much simpler and I can't find a way to apply them to my problem. Is an Ehrenfest urn what I am looking for or is there any other any name? Am I missing something and is there any other way to model this problem?Thanks!
