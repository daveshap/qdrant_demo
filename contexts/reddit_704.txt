I need help with this girl I’m taking to
hi I’m 14 years old and I really like this girl we’ve been talking for about a week or two, I want to ask her to be my girlfriend but can’t seem to find the courage,I feel like if I ask her out and she says no our friendship will be ruined as she’s one of the best people I’ve ever met.
