Finally done with PhD
I am finally done with my PhD after 5 years of whirlwind. I am sharing here because I want to share somewhere and didn’t feel like sharing anywhere in twitter and fuck Facebook. I never thought I would see this day two years ago when I failed my comprehensive exam. But with diligence I am on the other side. So wanted to share some love to all hardworking and struggling graduate students, don’t give up, the feeling after being done is worth the hard work. A lot of love to this subreddit for all the inspiring stories and motivation.
