GRAHAM: Hello.
CYNTHIA: Hi.
CYNTHIA: Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
GRAHAM: Okay.
CYNTHIA: I'd like to make another tape.
GRAHAM: No.
CYNTHIA: No? Not even one more?
GRAHAM: I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
CYNTHIA: I can't talk you into it?
GRAHAM: No. You'll have to get somebody else.
CYNTHIA: Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
GRAHAM: I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
CYNTHIA: But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
GRAHAM: Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
CYNTHIA: So make an exception.
GRAHAM: No.
CYNTHIA: How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
GRAHAM: I would.
CYNTHIA: Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
GRAHAM: Cynthia, I don't know.
CYNTHIA: I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
GRAHAM: I'm sorry. I can't do it.
CYNTHIA: Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
GRAHAM: No.
