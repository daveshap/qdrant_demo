9hr FaceTime Study Date
I work full time plus more on some weeks and work is sponsoring me to upgrade to care for higher acuity patients. Iâ€™ve been busy with school, work and still trying to spend time with the family.

He suggested a video call date to help me be more accountable. I take lots of break when studying. He basically spent his Saturday reading a book in front of a laptop with me ðŸ¥° Couldâ€™ve been doing a lot more things like playing games, guitar, etc.

Iâ€™m just gushing.
