RNN for Sequential Data I am working with data that requires classifying if a patient will develop cancer or not in the future, based on medical tests done over time. The tests have a sequential relationship. A, then B, then C, etc. For example:| Patient ID | Test ID | RBC Count | WBC Count | Label| 1          | A       | 4.2        | 7000     | 0| 1          | B       | 5.3        | 12000    | 0| 1          | C       | 2.4        | 15000    | 1| 2          | A       | 7.6        | 8000     | 0| 2          | A       | 7.4        | 7500     | 0Each point is not taken at a regular time interval, so this may not be considered a time-series data. I have tried to aggregate features and use ensemble methods like Random Forests. Can I apply RNN? If so, how? Or other methodologies?
