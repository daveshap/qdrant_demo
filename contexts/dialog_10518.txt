HARRY: I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
DORIS: You seem to feel fine about it.
HARRY: I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
DORIS: Murray's dead.
HARRY: So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
DORIS: No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
HARRY: Yeah, what'd he have to say?
DORIS: He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
HARRY: How honorable of you.
