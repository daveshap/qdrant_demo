ISABELLA: I run down the numbers. Nothing is very negotiable. Small loads? We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent. The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
TUBBS: Define small.
ISABELLA: Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000. Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup. For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load. Transactions are offshore. Dollars or euros. Secure internet transfers. We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided... No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil... That's the deal.
CROCKETT: I thought we had to meet the Man.
ISABELLA: You do.
CROCKETT: When?
ISABELLA: Right now.
