BREE: Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
KLUTE: No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.
BREE: You wanted to, or you are?
KLUTE: I am.
BREE: You could at least look at me!
BREE: Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
KLUTE: About what?
BREE: Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
KLUTE: I don't think so.
BREE: How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
KLUTE: They don't scare me any more.
BREE: What?
KLUTE: Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
