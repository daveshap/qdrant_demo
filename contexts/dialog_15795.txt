BEN: Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
SERA: OK.
BEN: I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?
SERA: Why?
BEN: Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
SERA: Well... OK...
BEN: Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
SERA: No?
BEN: No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
SERA: I know that...
BEN: ...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
SERA: Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
BEN: Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
SERA: Whatever that means. Open your presents.
