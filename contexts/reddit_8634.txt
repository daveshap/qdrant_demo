President Trump has blamed the decline of US Dairy squarely on Canada, I'd like to know why?

I really don't understand what we could have done that would be putting US dairy out of business. 

Our population is ~11% of the US. It's a tiny market by comparison ([US approx 324,907,020](https://www.census.gov/popclock/) vs [Canada at approx 36,286,400](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo02a-eng.htm) persons). Even assuming that every single individual person consumed at least some dairy it's a drop in the proverbial bucket. 

What specific Canadian policies is Trump referring to when he makes these claims and are they indeed to blame for a decline in the US dairy industry?
