HELP ME PLEASE
Hi, I’m 15 and I’ve known this girl for about 4 years, we are very close and we have never hung out in real life before other than at school.  I want to ask her to hang out sometime, how should I approach this? Help me.

She talks to like 4 other guys on and off but isn’t that close to them, She is comfortable enough to where she can open up to me when she is going through stuff, I am the one who is there to support. She has been there for me when I vent to her about personal things and when I went though family stuff. I trust her a lot.
I like her but some of my friends that I’ve known for a long time seem to like her too, they hit on her and they try and be obnoxiously funny around her and I think they only like her for her body. She’s one of those people who is really nice to people so she doesn’t really notice.  I DON’T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS. 

She’s sent mixed signals to me over the time I’ve known her, we are at the point where we can talk almost about anything openly to each other without it being weird. 
I don’t know what to do about all of this, some of her friends have also said that we would be “cute together” because we have a similar kind of personality. Should I open up to her and tell her how I feel about her because this has been bugging me for a while, I could use any advice. Ask questions too!

(Sorry if there are any spelling/errors, I’m writing this at 4 in the morning)
