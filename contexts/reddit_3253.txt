Wanting to switch careers & really enjoy researching/analyzing information - other than data analyst, what are some careers/career paths I should look into?
I could write a long passage about why I'm choosing to switch careers, but I'll leave that for another time and just include some quick background information:

Current employment: School Counselor (6 years)

Previous employment: Fraud Prevention (3 years), Retail/retail management (2 years), various 2nd/part-time jobs (meat market, office cleaning, tutoring)

Education: B.A. Psychology & Sociology; M.S. in Education/School Counseling

I'm introverted but more than willing to work around, and closely with others (as long as I have some time in the day to work independently to "recharge my batteries").  I've looked into data analyst careers and like the overall idea of that type of work.  However, I'm wondering what other careers/career paths might include a lot of researching/analyzing information that I could possibly be overlooking?  If you could also include what type of training/schooling I might need to begin that career, I would appreciate it.

Thanks in advance!
