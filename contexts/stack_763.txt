Can I switch to Ubuntu from Windows? I am a developer and I really want to switch to Ubuntu. When I switch to Ubuntu, can I run Windows virtually (VirtualBox) for some testing?I often use some photo editing software like Photoshop can I run it on Ubuntu?I have a lot of questions about the drivers. Can I support USB 3.0, audio, touchpad, video drivers smoothly like running on Windows (mainly I need my touchpad drivers for some shortcuts and drivers?
