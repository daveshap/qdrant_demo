Around \u201cwhich\u201d or around \u201cwho\u201d or around which? In a sentence that reads, \u201cAlign your attention with that maternal star around **** we orbit\u201d, what word would be suitable? I am unsure because \u201cmaternal star\u201d adds gender and very nearly attributes personhood to the object of the sentence. I understand that normally you would say \u201cStar around which we orbit*. But is it acceptable to use who of whom given what strikes me as a special case? Any clarification would be greatly appreciated.
