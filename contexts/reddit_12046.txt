I feel like there's nothing I can do.
I don't know exactly what is wrong with me, but I haven't been feeling well since January.  I used to cry once, maybe twice a year.  Since January I've been crying myself to sleep almost every night.

I got out of my poor living situation.  I thought this would help greatly but it's the same problems, just better scenery.  I got a job I like over the summer, it helped greatly as it distracted me from my problems, but I don't have the time to work during the school term.

Some problems I've tried to fix, but they keep persisting.  I have no friends, so I tried to put myself out there.  I joined a couple clubs on campus, and went to some social groups organized over meetup.  I had a good time and met some people, but after a few months of this I've only managed to make more acquaintances.  I've tried talking to a school counselor, but I can only see him every 7 weeks because there's so much demand.  He recommended I see a therapist but it costs more than I can afford on a student budget.

I've tried to improve myself.  I don't want to be like this.  I feel like no matter what I do my problems can't be fixed.
