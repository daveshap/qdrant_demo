SPENGLER: Oh! You're here.
VENKMAN: What have you got, Egon?
SPENGLER: Oh, this is big, Peter. This is very big. There's definitely something here.
VENKMAN: Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head. Do you remember that?
HEAD LIBRARIAN: Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian. Are you the men from the University?
VENKMAN: Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
HEAD LIBRARIAN: Thank you for coming. I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
VENKMAN: One thing at a time. We don't even know what it is yet.
