DOUG: No, just a drill.
HONZA: A drill, what are you up to?
DOUG: Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
HONZA: Yeah.
DOUG: And a fifty foot extension lead?
HONZA: You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
DOUG: Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka.
HONZA: Sure!
DOUG: Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
HONZA: Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
DOUG: No problem, is it at your place?
HONZA: Yeah.
DOUG: Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
HONZA: But I have to finish this....
DOUG: Come on, that shit can wait.
