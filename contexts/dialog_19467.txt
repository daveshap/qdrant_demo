HUEY: Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
MS. JONES: I don't want my windshield cleaned.
HUEY: You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
MS. JONES: No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
HUEY: Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
MS. JONES: For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
HUEY: It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
MS. JONES: I don't have to pay you nothin'.
HUEY: You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
MS. JONES: Fuckin' A.
HUEY: I don't think so.
MS. JONES: Hey!
HUEY: I think this is worth a dollar.
