Training Course Dilemma
First off, thanks for reading this. I am in a bit of a catch 22 situation right now with this training course which my boss would like me to take. 

It is not required, but I did tell my boss I was interested in taking the course. It is going to cost $1,200 which is basically an entire paycheck for me. I can fill out a company form for tuition reimbursement, however, I have to sign an agreement that if I stay with the company for 6 months I owe 50% of the course or a full year for 0%.  I personally do not see myself staying here any longer than maybe 3 more months at most, so I would basically have to pay for the entire course on my own. 

My question is how can I tactfully say to my boss that I no longer would like to take the course without giving the impression that I plan on leaving at some point in the near future? I don't want to be $1,200 in the hole because I took a course for a career path I am no longer interested in anymore.
