MAX: I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
WELLES: Good for you.
WELLES: How long you been working there?
MAX: Three, four years.
WELLES: What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
MAX: Max.
WELLES: Well, here's the deal, Max. This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
MAX: There's not much illegal.
WELLES: Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know. I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great. If not, speak now.
MAX: You're not a cop, are you? If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
WELLES: I'm not a cop.
MAX: You're a private eye. Like Shaft.
WELLES: Not quite.
MAX: From Pennsylvania. P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
WELLES: Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
MAX: How much?
WELLES: How much do you make now?
MAX: Four hundred a week, off the books.
WELLES: Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
MAX: Sounds good, pops.
WELLES: Here's my number if you need it... When can you start?
MAX: Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
WELLES: See you then. Oh, and, don't call me pops.""
WELLES: ... Hello... ?
MAX: Wake up, pops. Your education begins tonight.
