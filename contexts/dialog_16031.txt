RAY: Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
CLAUDE: Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
RAY: Start your job? What kind of job?
CLAUDE: Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
RAY: That's some long green.
CLAUDE: Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
CLAUDE: What?
RAY: Nothing.
CLAUDE: No, tell me what's so funny.
RAY: I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
CLAUDE: Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
RAY: Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
CLAUDE: I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
RAY: Why didn't you take it?
CLAUDE: The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
RAY: You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
CLAUDE: At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
RAY: You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
CLAUDE: Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
RAY: A loan officer?
CLAUDE: That's right, a loan officer.
RAY: So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
CLAUDE: Uh-huh.
RAY: How would I get a loan, anyway?
CLAUDE: You need collateral.
RAY: Like this?
CLAUDE: That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
RAY: My daddy gave me this watch.
CLAUDE: Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
RAY: My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
CLAUDE: Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
RAY: Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
CLAUDE: There is no Boom-Boom Room.
RAY: When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
CLAUDE: Oooh...
RAY: I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
