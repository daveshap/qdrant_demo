WALTER: What's up?
BARRY: Well I'm sorry. Before...
WALTER: Mhm.
BARRY: And I'm sorry that I did that.
WALTER: It's alright.
BARRY: I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
WALTER: Yeah.
BARRY: I don't like the way I am sometimes. Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
BARRY: I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
WALTER: Like a psychiatrist?
BARRY: I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
WALTER: You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
BARRY: I don't know if there's anything wrong with me because I don't know how other people are.....Sometimes I cry a lot.....for no reason.
