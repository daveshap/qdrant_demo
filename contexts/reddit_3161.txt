Is this email okay for reaching out to an old boss/mentor?
Relationship ended well, I just wanted to update him on starting grad school and let him know he had a role in it. How is this email, specifically the last 2 sentences:

Hi \*\*\*! Just thought Iâ€™d reach out and say hello. I am 1 week out from starting school, and wanted to thank you again for both your letter of recommendation as well as your mentorship over the years. Hope things are going well with you and the team. I am interested in \[going into the field he's in, in the distant future\], so **maybe our paths will cross again in the future. Stay in touch!**

EDIT: Email has been sent. Thanks all for your input!
