Book ending with a space ship flying out of an ice floe in which it was hidden? I read this in the 80s. There were hangar doors in a (fake?) ice floe underneath which the ship was built. And maybe something about \"Miranda\" (a star? and the ship's destination?), but I'm not sure. Does anybody remember the book?I read it in German, but I don't know whether or not it was translated.
