I can't begin to describe what I'm feeling right now. Relief, joy, a drained bank account, but overall happy.

I just submitted the final payment on two of my cards and $450 on the last one, of which I still have a remaining balance of $166. It's still a decent amount of money but it's nothing another paycheck can't fix. But I'm not totally debt-free, I didn't post this in my original post, but I do owe some money to my mom ($1,500 for helping me get back into college, I kept putting it off because I didn't have the funds, nor the saving habits I have now. She agreed to pay for the first quarter on the stipulation that I pay her back and do well in school. Grades are good, just have to pay her back) as well as my brother ($300 for driving me around to the dog sitting gigs) and on the upside, I'll have my own car to drive myself very very soon so I won't have to rely on him anymore.

I've set all my cards on auto-pay, with notifications if I go over a set amount (well below my 30% utilization)  the banks will text me about it.

To celebrate I'm gonna go out with friends for dinner, and then on Saturday I'm going on a 3 day trip with my boyfriend until Tuesday, gonna relax and unwind and wait for the next paycheck (which will be larger considering one week I worked 41 hours when I was only scheduled for 28.)

You guys are the first people I've told. Thank you, I'm gonna go tell my mom!
