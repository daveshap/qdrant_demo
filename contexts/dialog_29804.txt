CLARENCE: Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But
LEE: I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
CLARENCE: Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
LEE: Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
CLARENCE: OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever."
LEE: Thank you very much, Clarence.
CLARENCE: You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. Sophie's Choice"
LEE: I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
CLARENCE: Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
