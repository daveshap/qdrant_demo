BEN: Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
JACKIE: I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
BEN: Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
ANNABELLE: I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
JACKIE: <u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
ANNABELLE: I hate when you say that.
JACKIE: Thank you. Those were all words. I hate the planet Uranus. <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
JACKIE: I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together. <u>Hate</u>.
BEN: I have lava.
JACKIE: Lava's hateable. I never thought of that.
ANNABELLE: I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
JACKIE: Excellent point.
BEN: I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
ANNABELLE: I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
