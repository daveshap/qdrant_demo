I’m a laid-off Recreation Manager at a high end beach resort with an open mind about my next step. Looking for suggestions.
The title explains my situation. I graduated with a bachelors degree in Parks, Recreation, and Tourism Management in 2016. I’ve been working in hotels for the past four years, but the recreation side of hotels may be a tough place to find work for a little while. I’ve been open to starting a new career path since pre-Covid times, but now seems like the time to actually make that happen. I have no idea what I’d like to do though. 

What are some industries that are possible to break into during these times without previous experience, and what are the steps to become successful in those fields? I am open to all suggestions!
