How to interpret the multiple regression results? For selection of independent variables in multiple regression analysis, first  have calculated correlation coefficient between dependent (y) and independent variables (x1, x2, x3, x4 &amp; x5) and then I performed multiple regression analysis using significantly correlated variables. Result shows: y &amp; x1 = 0.91; y &amp; x2 = 0.90; y &amp; x3 = 0.23; y &amp; x4 = 0.18; y &amp; x5 = 0.23; all the correlation values are significant (pval &lt;0.05).In multiple regression to derive linear model, I started with two predictors, x1 &amp; x2 which are highly correlated and sequentially added the rest of the predictors. For model1 (x1 &amp; x2) the R-square value is 0.88 and coefficient values of x1 and x2 are significant.For model2 (x1, x2 &amp; x3) the R-square value is 0.88 and coefficient values are significant for x1 &amp; x2 while insignificant for x3.Similar R-square value is obtained for model3 (x1, x2, x3 &amp; x4) and the coefficent values are insignificant for x3 &amp; x4.For model4 (x1, x2, x3, x4 &amp; x5) the higher R-square value (0.90) is obtained  and coefficient values of x1 and x5 are significant while other variables (x2, x3 &amp; x4) shows insignificant coefficient value.correlation matrix........x1........x2........x3........x4.......x5x1....1x2....0.89....1x3....0.30....0.15....1x4....0.19....0.12....0.87....1x5....0.49....0.15....0.52....0.38My question is, in model4 why x2 is showing insignificant coefficient value while it is highly correlated with y? And finally which model I should consider for prediction of y?%%%%%%%%%%%   Edits 25.05.2018   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%I made some changes in analysis. I removed x5 variable and added another variable instead of net radiation. So, this time I used x1 (rainfall), x2 (soil moisture), x3 (temperature) and x4 (vegetation data) and all models, passed the test of significance in the regression at a p value of 0.05.Now result shows: For model1 (x1 &amp; x2) the R-square value is 0.88 and standard error is 18.29, For model2 (x1, x2 &amp; x3) the R-square value is 0.89 and standard error is 17.53, For model3 (x1, x2, x3 &amp; x4) R-square value is 0.89 and standard error is 17.42. You can see R-square and standard error values are almost similar. In this case, can I calculate accuracy (in percentage) in each model?
