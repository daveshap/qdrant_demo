HARRY: I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
HELEN: They must've just missed me.
HARRY: They said you had to run out.
HELEN: Yeah. It was a rush thing. They needed some documents down at the court house. I barely made it.
HARRY: So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day. Did is work out okay?
HELEN: Oh, sure. Fine. I'll get some more gravy.
