TOMMY: What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
KAYLEIGH: Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
TOMMY: Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
TOMMY: Here you go, buddy.
LENNY: What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
TOMMY: The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
LENNY: Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
