I hate that it seems like everyone does better without me.
Especially with my last few exes, and friends who i've lost and even others..it always seems like when I drop out of their lives, everything goes better.

First ex-girlfriend: happily in a relationship and about to move out of our soulless town. Second ex : Now in an apparently "much more steady" relationship and getting ready to go to Grad school. Hell even the guy I ended up hurting because I dated my second ex has a hot girlfriend and has gotten his life back on track quickly.

It's just weird because everyone says "oh well they weren't the one, the right one will come along"...yet everyone else's "right one" either comes along that much faster or maybe my "right one" just isn't coming. Just weird to hear all of my old friends talking about how life is so good for them all but yet..life just doesn't seem to get much better for me compared to everyone else. Maybe i'm just expecting too much, maybe i'm just too depressed to worry about it. But you would think after 3-4 years that things would get a lot better for you , and you would maybe have something to come back with when everyone else talks about how awesome their lives are.

Somedays I really just hope i'm expecting too much and that my time's coming...
