HELEN: If you're home it means either Jack and Bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you, or --
KENNY: -- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
HELEN: A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
BOBBY: Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
KENNY: Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
BOBBY: We just got a second letter from Khruschev. The deal's off.
BOBBY: We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
KENNY: What does the letter say?
BOBBY: They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
