SAM: Morning, Hollis.
HOLLIS: Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
SAM: You thought any more about our murder?
HOLLIS: We have a murder?
SAM: Charley Wade.
HOLLIS: I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
SAM: I got an idea what happened.
HOLLIS: Do you?
SAM: I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
HOLLIS: You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
SAM: I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
