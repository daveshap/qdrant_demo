Powertop shows ~30W, and fans working somewhat hard, during light internet browsing I have an MSI GS65, on which I installed 18.04 alongside Windows 10.Things are generally going well, but I notice my fans are often going at a moderate clip, and the battery life is not so great. Running powertop at the terminal shows I'm often drawing nearly 30W! System monitor reveals CPU's are not under particular strain (mostly closer to 0% than 20% usage) and RAM is ~33% usage.  I'm having a little bit of difficulty further diagnosing the problem. I don't think it's the nvidia drivers (I'm using nouveau drivers), but I could be wrong. I've also already installed tlp, and set all powertop tunables to 'good'.I'll be very grateful for any ideas.EDIT: Still having this problem on 18.10
