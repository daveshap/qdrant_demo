Can someone explain what this firm does please?
At (Company name), we consider ourselves specialists. We are able to navigate the sometimes choppy waters of real estate financing. We understand that the perfect situation is rare when it comes to real estate investing. When there are problems with title, property conditions, property types, traditional loans aren’t always available. That’s when you turn to (Company name).
We have assembled a team of professionals that can not only secure your financing, we can get you closed quickly. By using our Fund or tapping into our network of partners, we can move as fast as you need to.


The (Company name) Fund is a unique investment vehicle that focuses on lending secured by commercial properties with cannabis related business operators as tenants. The Fund offers the advantage of near equity like returns with a targeted yield of 15% and the security of being recorded as debt in first lien position. All of our transactions are conservatively underwritten and vigorously vetted.


Thank you in advance!
