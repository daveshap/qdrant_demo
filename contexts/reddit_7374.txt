How I prepared for my first phone interview
Last week I had my first ever phone interview. Luckily, it was a scheduled interview, so I had a couple of days to get prepared and ask my friends about their experience. 


My former classmate, let's call her Julie, had her first phone interview about a month ago, it went well, she got to the next round which was the office interview, but didn't get the job due to lack of experience. (By the way, don't you just love this "no job - no experience - no job" vicious cycle?)


Julie told me she was prepared, read about the company, thought the possible questions through, so she was pretty much relaxed when the phone rang.


Now we know that the call went well, but **Julie made some mistakes**:


1) During the interview she was lying on a couch in her pajamas, that's why her voice was too relaxed and later during the office interview the employer said she didn't sound "really motivated to get the job".


2) She didn't turn off the Facebook notifications on her phone so during the talk she was distracted by the message sounds a couple times. Also someone tried to call her on Skype.


3) The other thing Julie regretted was that she didn't have all the needed documents handy. When the employer asked if she had any questions about the company, she remembered she had some, but had put aside her notebook and forgot what it was.


So **Julie helped me realize this**:

1) I better wear something formal and sit straight so that my voice sounds interested and serious, not demotivated.

2) I should eliminate all the distractions

3) My resume, my notes and company info should be somewhere near when I get the call.


Another friend of mine Mike said he got a call from a company when he was walking home. The interviewer asked if he was available to talk at that moment and he said 'yes'. Mike later regretted it because half way through the interview he got nervous and couldn't answer the questions properly. So his advice to me was **never agree to have an unscheduled phone interview**. Apologize, say that you're busy and schedule for later. That way you'll get an opportunity to prepare.


I had a couple other friends give me some tips. I've collected all of it here, in an [article](http://www.essaytigers.com/blog/getting-ready-your-first-phone-interview).


My phone interview went pretty well. I was a little nervous, but prepared. I have an office interview scheduled in a couple days. Wish me luck! And hope my advice helps you!
