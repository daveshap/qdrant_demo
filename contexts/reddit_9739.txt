Working entry level position vs. getting masters with assistantship(tuition wavier)
I'm currently working for a local college at entry level position.  The pay is pretty low, and they don't offer masters program.  I recently applied for a few grad programs with assitantship and have a really good chance of getting in.  I did read a similar post on here, but it didn't mention how it's going to be paid.  From what I hear, it's really competitive to even get into entry level position.  However, getting masters for almost free is too good to pass.  
Can GA experience substitute work experience or am I better off staying with the current position and find a way to get master's while still working?
The current institution might reimburse part of tuition as well.  But I can't help but think that I might have a better chance of getting a higher position with master's.  What would be the better choice here?
