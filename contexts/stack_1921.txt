\"is starting on ...\" Why is it Present? I have exercise to create sentences in Present Continuous but in one of them is. \" The sales is starting on Monday\". My question is about time used here, in my opinion this will happens only in future \" On Monday\" But the tense is Present so i'm little lost. What is different(in the meaning on structure)  between this and  Future Continuous like \" The sales will be starting in Monday\"
