Cluster Configuration I\u2019m looking at some of the SQL servers in a (new to me) SQL estate. The servers are configured for AOAGs; there are two nodes, both are part of the WSFC. However, if I look at the SQL Server advanced properties the 'Clustered' attribute = 'No'. Would we expect them to be in a SQL cluster sat on a WSFC? In which case I would expect the 'Clustered' attribute = 'Yes'.
