I need help... seriously
Okkkk I need help. As you can tell the title says it all ðŸ˜‚. But seriously I have a guy best friend and I didnâ€™t think I would grow feelings for him... but here we are and Iâ€™m seriously in love with him. I am wayy to scared to tell him how I feel. So anyone got any ideas on how to either sneakily tell him I like him or get him to say who he likes. Thanks my fellow friends
