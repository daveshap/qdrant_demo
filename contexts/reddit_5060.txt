Social Media Admin Job (sad)
i joined an online school startup as a language partner. I have been talking with the owner via fb messenger too regarding improvements and suggestions. One time he asked me via pm if I want to become an admin of the startup's Social Media acct. Basically all you have to do is answer questions, post announcements, maybe curate some graphics. He asked me for my hourly charge. 

I have never done this sort of freelance job before. I have a full time job as a Social Media Team Lead for an airline though. It's different but somehow related. I was hesitant to really state a specific amount and told him it's up to him. He insisted so i said 1000JPY. 

He also did not mention the number of hours yet. I asked him if it's too much and told him I can charge less the longer the hours. Was it a bad amount? Was it too much?

After that he said he'll think about it. The next morning I saw that one of my fellow language partners now works as an admin for him. I feel sort of sad and disappointed with myself. 

I didnt know how to negotiate. Or perhaps she had a better skill. Idk. Can you please honestly tell me if the amount I mentioned was too much? Thank you.
