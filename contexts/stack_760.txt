Canon PIXMA P200 cannot scan in Ubuntu 16.04LTS Good day.I just started using Ubuntu 16.04LTS and is testing everything.My only concern for now is that I cannot use anymore the scanning capability of my Canon P200. I searched this forum but nothing was mentioned about P200. I searched Ubuntu Software but to no avail.I hope someone could assist me, and hopefully using GUI's and much as possible not the Terminal.Thanks in advance.
