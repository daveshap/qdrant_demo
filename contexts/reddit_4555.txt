Teenage Daughter Cutting.
I'm writing here because we still have another month before she can get into the psychiatrist. I just need help. They didn't want to hold her for 72 hours, yet I get no sleep worrying. She says she doesn't know why she is sad and angry. I have battled depression for 15 years due to not being medicated for postpartum, but her mental health is much more important to me. Asking for recommendations for coping mechanisms that have worked for your situation. Today she had a bad day. They are seeming to get worse. Any recommendations would be very very appreciated.
