Alarms
I sleep through my alarm almost everyday I set multiple in hopes it will wake me up but I’ll straight up sleep through all them I might hear one and asleep press snooze and then sleep through the rest. But if I place my alarm further away I ain’t gonna hear it at all everyone else in the house hears it but I don’t I’ll sleep right through them any tips? Any advice on what I can do and it’s not like I’m lacking sleep I get a solid 8-9 hours 

Edit: I feel like this might be part that i was extremely tired last night since we did have a long holiday break and I was staying up late that whole week but it makes no sense it feels like the day I didn’t sleep at all (yesterday) because I couldn’t sleep since my sleep schedule was so used to going to bed at 4-5am  I fell asleep at 5 and woke up at 6 for school 
But today and every other day I just straight up sleep through my alarms and sometimes it says I snooze it but I have no memory of snoozing my alarm especially today
