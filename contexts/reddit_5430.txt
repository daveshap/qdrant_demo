Does a decent personal blog count as experience to marketing hiring managers?
Currently I’m a technical writer, but it’s boring and a bit of a dead end. 

I want a more creative job, so I’m thinking content writer for an ad firm or something like that. 

But my only qualification is an MFA, a niche literary/sports blog with 9,000 views per month, and one semester of web development courses at the local college.

Obviously the blog is my best quantifiable portfolio piece because of views, but do hiring managers even care about that? 

Also, what sort of creative/marketing jobs would a technical writer with a niche literary blog be qualified for? Like what are the job titles to look for? Sorry I’m a super noob to anything outside my current industry.

Thanks!

P.s. any other tips on what marketing hiring managers look for in a portfolio would be great. I’m aiming for upper-entry-level work.
