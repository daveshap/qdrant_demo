How do you go about applying for a job in a different state before you move there?
I currently live in Arkansas, and by the summer I'm hoping to have saved enough to move to Portland. However, due to how volatile the area is, I want to have a guaranteed job lined up before I move. My question is, how do you go about getting a job in a state that you don't live in? Like, how would the interview process go? Would I just have to hope that they'd do an over the phone interview?
