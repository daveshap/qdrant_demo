Overwatch competitive points reward at season (4) end As you probably already know, you get competitive points after winning or tying a match. When you get 3k of those CP you can buy a golden weapon.When a competitive season ends, you get a reward based on your rank. The thing that I want to know is, possibly with a link to an official thread, if this reward is based on the season high or the current rank that you end with.Example: I'm a master right now (between 3500 and 4000) and if I end like so I should get 2k CP. If I drop under 3500 and go back to diamond (since from master and above you can actually derank) will I still get 2k or 1.2k CP?
