Is adult life after college just sort of, guesswork and taking it one day at a time?
I graduated college at 22, I'm 25 now, and not in my field, but working towards it. A lot of my day-to-day life is figuring things out and wondering where I'm heading and going. Most of the time, I do not know what I am doing, I am just guessing, what to eat for dinner, where to go on my day off, what jobs to apply for, everything in life is sort of guessing for me. I don't mind it, but there's no one to essentially hold your hand, and I'm wondering if other people felt the same about all this. Guessing where to go, guessing what job to take.

In high school and college, everything is given to you. Your schedule, your friends, essentially, your life. With being a free man, you have so much time at your disposal and it's kind of bizarre not to try to make anything of it.

TLDR; is life after college just a guessing game, and what do you do?
