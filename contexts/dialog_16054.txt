RAY: Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
CLAUDE: So?
RAY: You know what I'm saying.
CLAUDE: Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
RAY: That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
CLAUDE: What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
RAY: What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
CLAUDE: Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
RAY: You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
CLAUDE: No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
RAY: What does that mean?
CLAUDE: Forget it.
RAY: I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
CLAUDE: Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
