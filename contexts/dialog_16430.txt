HARRY: What the fuck are you doing here?
VALENTIN: Looking for you. I tried the hotel.
HARRY: Why'd you come here?
VALENTIN: You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief. Here's thirty thousand dollars.
HARRY: What for?
VALENTIN: A ticket home,
HARRY: You didn't hire me. She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
VALENTIN: She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain. Enough churning over the past. She wants it all left alone.
HARRY: Left alone? Somebody's been murdered.
VALENTIN: Yes. It's regrettable
HARRY: Fuck regrettable! I want to know why.
VALENTIN: What for? You need to stay busy?
HARRY: I like to know why things happen.
VALENTIN: Why people die? Give it up, D'Amour. Go home.
HARRY: No.
