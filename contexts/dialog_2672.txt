CHEEBA: I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
MANTAN: What are you talkin' about?
CHEEBA: Jim Jones, y'know. I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
MANTAN: Meaning?
CHEEBA: I'm out.
MANTAN: Good. I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway.
CHEEBA: So that's what you been doing?
MANTAN: Damn skippy.
CHEEBA: You're in this up till ya neck.
MANTAN: Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
CHEEBA: You can walk away. We both can.
MANTAN: Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
CHEEBA: I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you. You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
