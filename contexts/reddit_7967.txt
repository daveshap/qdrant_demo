What should I do next?
Hey y’all, 

So today I found out the Graduate Assistantship of my dreams turned me down, not sure if it’s because of budgetary reasons or they hired someone else. The majority of GAships I’ve found are already filled or can’t be filled due to budget, and I’m getting really nervous about paying for my Master’s. My program is Public Policy and this is the very first year for the program at my university. 

I’m really at a loss of what to try now, I was really hoping for the tuition waiver a GA position could offer, but now I’m losing hope that I’ll find one. I have degrees in Political Science and Legal Studies, and I’m not sure how likely it is I can get a job in that field given the state of the economy for the foreseeable future. 

Do y’all have any advice on where I should start looking next or what my next steps should be to try to get funding?
