How come I can't choose suicide as an option? (serious)
Basically the title. Every time I or some one I know talks about suicide it's always an unacceptable choice that no one can ever make. Why?

I didn't ask to be here, I don't want to be here. Why do others get to dictate when I can go?

I understand trying to overcome depression and other mental illnesses that play into suicidal thoughts, but what if I'm sick of trying? Or I just don't care? Or I have tried and failed so many times that I feel it's hopeless?

I'm not trying to trigger anyone having these same thoughts, I just genuinely don't want to be alive. I find no joy, excitement or purpose in it and want it to be over. Why do I not get that choice?
