GEORGE: Oh. Of course... sorry.
BETTY: My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
GEORGE: Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
BETTY: Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
GEORGE: I have... did it sound that bad?
BETTY: Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
GEORGE: George...
BETTY: ...George. I do. My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
GEORGE: Thanks...
BETTY: ...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
