I looooove when you finally tell someone you’re anxious and they tell you you’re making it up.
Has anyone had a situation like this?

I’ve had family, professors, bosses tell me I’m just making up excuses.

In reality, I tense up, get defensive, want to crawl out of my skin. It’s hard to talk about but it’s even worse when I finally do sh my anxiety gets called an “excuse”.

My anxiety makes me come off aloof or like an asshole but I’m just trying to get through it.
