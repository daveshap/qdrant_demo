VERONICA: Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
J.D.: Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
VERONICA: Killing her won't solve anything.
J.D.: A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
VERONICA: Well then, I'll pray for rain.
J.D.: See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
VERONICA: Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
J.D.: Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
VERONICA: There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
J.D.: I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
VERONICA: I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
J.D.: Good plan.
VERONICA: But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
