MAX: Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
WELLES: A weirdo making S+M films? Who'd have thought it?
MAX: His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore. Definitely not for the squeamish.
WELLES: Specialty product.
MAX: You're learning.
WELLES: Where does he sell it?
MAX: Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look. He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
MAX: Nothing illegal, it's always borderline. Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
WELLES: Alright, I get the picture.
MAX: He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
WELLES: Well, I'm in New York now. What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
MAX: I'm a working stiff, pops.
WELLES: Take a vacation. I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
MAX: You want me to come out there and play private eye?
WELLES: Consider it. Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts. I'll call back.
MAX: See ya.
MRS CHRISTIAN: Hello?
WELLES: Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
MRS CHRISTIAN: How are you? Having any luck?
WELLES: I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
MRS CHRISTIAN: I've been ordered into bed. The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
WELLES: I hope it's nothing serious.
MRS CHRISTIAN: Nothing more than a bother. Have you any news for me?
WELLES: I've made progress. I'm in Manhattan. Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
MRS CHRISTIAN: Fine...
WELLES: I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
MRS CHRISTIAN: How will I get it to you?
WELLES: If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it.
MAX: You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
WELLES: It's their Presidential Suite.
MAX: Great.
MAX: Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
WELLES: It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?
