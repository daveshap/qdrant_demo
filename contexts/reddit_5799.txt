I'm getting fired today
Boss pulled me in today and told me they suspect when I called in sick yesterday I was interviewing for other organizations. (He's right, and the interviews went awesome!). He told me he'll likely let me go at the end of day today.

I'm feeling confident I'll get one of the jobs I interviewed for, but I'll make finding a job my full time job until I get an offer.

In the mean time, I have a family though. What are some ways I can make extra money for the next month or so until I land a job?
