I think I have decided to do it.
I have thought about suicide constantly for many years. My entire life, I have felt as though I have been genuinely cursed. Truly terrible things seem to happen to me with unusual frequency and I can't help but see that this is not how life is supposed to be. I can't even talk about my biggest problems, but a combination of mental illness, constant weight issues, being an outcast from society and seeing no hope for the future all contribute to these feelings.  I have tried holding out, I have tried soldiering on and I have done it for many years, but I live in a constant state of fear and suffering. My sister, who is probably the person I love most in the world, is one of the few reasons I have held on, because I felt that taking my life would hurt her. And I still believe that it would. But I have been thinking about how we are getting older, and it is not fair for me to rely on her as we become adults. She deserves to go have a good life as someone as truly beautiful and kind as she is deserves and if she is constantly hanging out with me, how can she ever have that? Honestly, I can't fight this anymore. I have seen therapists and taken antidepressants, but the only thing that helps me at all is abusing my anti anxiety medicine so I can sleep. I just really can't take it anymore and have stopped thinking about IF I should do it and more about how I should do it in a way that would least inconvenience the people I love the most. I'm thinking about going into the woods and just lying down and freezing to death or jumping in front of a train. I don't know why I am posting this, but I just needed to get this off my chest before I do it. Thank you for your time and I genuinely pray you all have lives better than mine.
