FRANK: You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
MRS. BAKER: Spur of the moment.
FRANK: So what'd you think?
MRS. BAKER: Thrilling. Both of you.
FRANK: The audience was a little off tonight.
MRS. BAKER: A few empty tables. It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
FRANK: I guess you're,right. Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
MRS. BAKER: No, no. You boys are tired.
FRANK: No, we're not. Jack?
JACK: No.
MRS. BAKER: I'm tired. Really. I should get home.
FRANK: You sure?
MRS. BAKER: Just call me a cab.
FRANK: A cab? Ma, come on. My car's just a half block down. You wait here.
MRS. BAKER: All right.
