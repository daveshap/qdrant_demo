A darker topic, but I really need help.
My girlfriend committed suicide a few days ago, or attempted it and passed away later that day. I was in an LDR with her for about 2 months but she disappeared for the last couple of days. At that point I called her obssessively and was really worried if anything happened to her. She talked to me in the past about the feeling of death and that she wasn’t afraid of it, and she’s been abused by her aunt for 6 years. I called her until her mum picked up and told me what happened.

She came over to where I lived the first time 1 month ago and we had an amazing time together. She left her pyjamas here to remind me of her. She enjoys playing video games and likes hello kitty. I kissed her for the first time and it was the happiest day of my life. I love her so much, I’m still in denial of her being gone forever. I can still remember her smell, her smiling face, her laugh, and her cry when she had to leave. I remember that she loved to eat chicken wings and she can speak 3 different languages.

I am stuck. I can’t afford to go and see her family, I’m only a student. We had a beautiful plan for the future together and now she’s gone forever. Help. What do I do?
