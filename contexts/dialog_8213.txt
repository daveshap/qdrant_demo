BRILL: The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it. The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world. At least it better be.
DEAN: How do you know so much?
BRILL: None of your business.
DEAN: You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
BRILL: I was a traffic analyst.
BRILL: I intercepted phone calls.
DEAN: How'd you get around the tap orders?
BRILL: They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do. Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic. Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.

DEAN: Why'd you leave?
BRILL: It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
DEAN: They come after you?
BRILL: Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.
BRILL: What do you think?
DEAN: Looks like Detroit.
BRILL: Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
