ETHAN: This is my favourite place in the city.
SUPERGIRL: Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
ETHAN: They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
ETHAN: Like it?
SUPERGIRL: Yes. It reminds me of home.
ETHAN: Where Superman's from? Krypton?
SUPERGIRL: No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
ETHAN: I'm sorry, I don't understand.
SUPERGIRL: It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
ETHAN: Come on, let's ride.
ETHAN: I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
SUPERGIRL: Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
ETHAN: Let's talk about us, not her.
SUPERGIRL: Tell me where I can find her.
ETHAN: I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
SUPERGIRL: But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
ETHAN: I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
SUPERGIRL: We can't do that.
ETHAN: Why not ?
SUPERGIRL: We're from different worlds.
ETHAN: Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
SUPERGIRL: All this talk about love, it's silly.
ETHAN: You don't like me? You hate me?
SUPERGIRL: Of Course I don't hate you. I don't hate anyone.
ETHAN: What do you feel about me?
