Equivalent of real-time disk usage feature of \"Task Manager\" for Windows? What is the window screen to reach to the hard disk usage percentage per second on Ubuntu?In windows, I just go to task manager and under the \"Tasks\" tab; there is CPU, memory, \"disk\" and network. (I can check on that \"disk\" there in task manager). On Ubuntu; I directly go to System Monitor. On System Monitor, there is CPU History, Memory and Swap History, Network History. But I want to check my hard disk usage percentage just like on windows. Is there any possible way to do this? ( The reason to check my disk usage is to check if the hard disk is okay or not because my laptop is extremely slow. I guess there could be some damage to the hard drive. Before I install Ubuntu; I used to use Windows OS. And on Windows OS, under task manager, disk usage percentage was 100% always even though there was no program opened, even just after reboot the Windows OS. I want to check the same disk percentage on Ubuntu now, but I couldn't see this \"disk percentage\" menu on Ubuntu. Is there any other menu I can reach to that beside System Monitor?)(edit*: my laptop specs are these: CPUs: 4, Vendor: GenuineItel, Model Name: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3210M CPU @2.50GHz, Frequency:1200.256 MHz, L2 cache: 3072 KB, Memory: Memory Total: 3828 MiB, Swap total: 3974 MiB, Hard Disk: Model Family: Seagate Samsung SpinPoint M8(AF),  Capacity: 1TB, Rotation Rate: 5400rpm)
