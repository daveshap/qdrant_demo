Furloughed to permanently laid off.
I just got laid off. The company furloughed most of us for 3 months while paying our insurance.

Now, I just got a call today and I have been laid off permanently. 

a month before the furlough. I helped my company enrolled in a quite lucrative and prestigious project (in my industry at least) based on my past position. In fact, I was offered a position in December (higher salary) by a competing firm and turned it down TWICE. 

I wanted to stay with my company, I figured at the time, since I helped the company with this project, there would be room for me to grow. 

Covid happened, I got furloughed. My boss assured me everything is fine. He said he appreciated my help with the project including his boss. He even said based on what he saw in the financial documents, our company was in good shape etc.


Now 3 months later, they're bringing some people back but they're laying off some including me. 

I know this is just how it is and how things are. But I can't help but feel like I'm not appreciated and felt like I was used.  Now, the project that I helped them with most likely would get them more work in the future. 
I've reached out to the other company whose offers I turned down twice. But I don't think they'll want me now. I did turn them twice. Oh well.
