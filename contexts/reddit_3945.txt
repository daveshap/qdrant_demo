Happy!
Today I ended stuff with someone who was manipulating me and emotionally feeding off of me. I tend to get myself into relationships where this is the case. I acknowledged it was bad and that my feelings are/were valid. I am happy I got myself out of this because I feel like it couldâ€™ve gotten worse. And I am so proud of myself
