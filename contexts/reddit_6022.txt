Turning down interviews in the time of Covid-19.
I lost my previous position because of Covid-19. I'm 1.5 weeks into my job search and I have three interviews thus far out of 36 applications. 

After an HR interview, I determined it's a bad fit. The work isn't interesting, I'd be forced to be at the office for weird hours to try to sync with the Pacific Time Zone despite being in Eastern, and I'd be in an office for no reason since I would not be interacting with anyone there (I asked).

I'm scared to turn it down because well....Covid-19 is making UX jobs harder to get and I'm scared for the second wave making things worse. I plan on working wherever my next role is for two years, which would mean that the recession is likely over, I have enough experience for most UX jobs (4 years plus a master's is enough to get most senior roles), and I could go anywhere I want. 

I am fully aware I might have to suffer for two years, particularly in a location I don't want to be in or a job with boring work. 

My finances are fine; I am moving back with parents and unemployment covers my monthly bills. I am not drawing unemployment yet and the mandate that you have to take the first job offered does not begin until July 31st unless a new bill is passed.

Would I be stupid to turn down interviews based on HR interviews during this time?
