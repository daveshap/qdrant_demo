I am afraid
Recently my apartment blew after someone left a bomb at the sub level, I was lucky and I survived with minor injuries, however when the police were clearing up the room, they found me and thought I was the bomber, they beat me up, they were around twenty people, it went on for a long time,  afterwards they took me to prison and found out I was an innocent bystander, they let me go. My body has healed but my mental state has not improved, I cant stop thinking about that day, I cant stop thinking about the fact that the people meant to protect me were the ones who violated me, I cant stop thinking if people in general are good, am also very afraid of the future, will this happen again, how can I not end up in the same situation. Am also thinking about suicide as a way to just end it all.
