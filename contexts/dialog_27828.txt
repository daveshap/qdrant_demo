MICHAEL: No. His name is Luca Brasi. You wouldn't like him.
KAY: Who is he?
MICHAEL: You really want to know?
KAY: Yes. Tell me.
MICHAEL: You like spaghetti?
KAY: You know I love spaghetti.
MICHAEL: Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
MICHAEL: Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business. They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
KAY: Al Capone!
MICHAEL: My Father sent Luca Brasi after them. He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
KAY: Michael...
MICHAEL: Then the legs at the knees...
KAY: Michael you're trying to scare me...
MICHAEL: Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
KAY: Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
MICHAEL: Then Luca turned to the other man...
KAY: Michael, I love you.
MICHAEL: ...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
KAY: I never know when you're telling me the truth.
MICHAEL: I told you you wouldn't like him.
KAY: He's coming over here!
MICHAEL: Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
KAY: How do you do.
MICHAEL: My brother, Tom Hagen.
HAGEN: Hello Kay. Your father's inside, doing some business. He's been asking for you.
MICHAEL: Thanks Tom.
KAY: If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
MICHAEL: My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in. He's a good lawyer.
