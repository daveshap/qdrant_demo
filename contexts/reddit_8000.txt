Anyone else struggle with being waitlisted for funding?
Got into my top choice (school I'm currently attending for my MA) and my advisor told me I'm high on the waitlist for funding and it could be until mid-April when I'll know if I got money or not.

Anyone else struggle through this? I am so happy I got into a PhD program but without money I can't go. I feel so deflated.
