Can I get an Environmental Health and Safety job with a BAS instead of a BS?
Hey all

So my current plan for my education is to get a BAS in environmental health and safety through an accredited college's online program. I want to then become an HSE/EHS Specialist or Manager, but when I look up job listings of that type, they ask for a BS. Will a BAS decrease my job prospects? The associate's I will be transferring into this BAS program with is an AS in Arts and Sciences (basically general studies) if that helps.
