CLAIRE: Oh God...you knew.
JODY: I was down in Adamant...
CLAIRE: Adamant?
JODY: Artsy little village down seven. There's a guy there who sells my work. I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
JODY: I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone. A blond. I only caught a glimpse. She was young. I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
CLAIRE: Why?
JODY: Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
CLAIRE: Relieved?
JODY: I had just been left by Richard. I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
JODY: By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
CLAIRE: Too late? Jody, it was an accident.
JODY: Alone? On a two lane road? With a ton of Valium in your system?
JODY: I got there first. Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman. He seemed desperate not to lose you. He promised to handle it. And we all let it drop away.
CLAIRE: All of us.
JODY: I'm a terrible friend.
CLAIRE: No.
CLAIRE: How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
JODY: What are you going to do?
CLAIRE: I don't know.
JODY: If she was dangerous before--
CLAIRE: She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
JODY: You don't know that. If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out. Somehow you have to break the connection.
CLAIRE: No. She wanted me to know the truth. Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
