TASLIMA: I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
PLISSKEN: What the hell is this?
TASLIMA: The freeway.
PLISSKEN: I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
TASLIMA: It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
TASLIMA: What are you gonna do in Venice?
PLISSKEN: Find Cuervo Jones.
TASLIMA: No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
TASLIMA: Run, Snake...They're coming.
PLISSKEN: Who?
