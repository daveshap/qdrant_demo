O'CONNELL: Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive?
EVELYN: Very slowly.
JONATHAN: He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
O'CONNELL: Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
EVELYN: According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
O'CONNELL: That bad huh?
EVELYN: Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
O'CONNELL: The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
BENI: Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
EVELYN: That's one way of putting it.
