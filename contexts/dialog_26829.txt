RIPLEY: Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
DICKIE: Relax.
RIPLEY: It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
DICKIE: Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
RIPLEY: Freddie?
DICKIE: Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
DICKIE: Frederico!
FREDDIE: Ciao bello. Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
DICKIE: This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
FREDDIE: Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
