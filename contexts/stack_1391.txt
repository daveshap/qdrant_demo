Is there a need to use public OUI numeration for \"private\" Ethernet ports? So I'm working on a product which will have two Ethernet ports:<br>One for \"public\" network, which will be used by the customer, and one internal, within the machine chassis, which needs to be opened, which should be only used by the service technician and internal accessories.  The dogma to which I was exposed to during my network training says that all Ethernet ports should use registered OUI numbers, but on the other hand, I'm can't really think of a reason why would we need an official MAC address in this case.  So my question is:<br>Is there any reason why to use the officially registered OUI numbers for the internal Ethernet port?
