MUNRO: Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
KORBEN: What mission?
MUNRO: To save the world.
KORBEN: Where have I heard this song before?
MUNRO: You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
KORBEN: Just one... why me?
MUNRO: Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
MUNRO: Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
KORBEN: And the third one?
MUNRO: You're the only one left alive...
MUNRO: Don't you open your messages?
KORBEN: I've had enough good news for today
MUNRO: You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
