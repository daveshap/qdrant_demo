LOU: One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
JIM: Let's get outta here, Lou. I saw too much stuff like this in the war.
BANISTER: Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right? I said Oswald must've flipped. Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
MARTIN: I think I'll cut out here, chief. I gotta get home.
BANISTER: Get home my ass. We're going to the office, have another drink. I want some company tonight.
BANISTER: Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination? Just goes to show, you can never know about some people. Am I right, Jack? Well, bless my soul. Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack. Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here. Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
MARTIN: Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
BANISTER: I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
BANISTER: Who the hell opened my files! You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
MARTIN: You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid. I mean, you really are.
BANISTER: You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on. You're a goddamn spy.
MARTIN: Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files? I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
BANISTER: I always lock my files. And you were the only one here today... What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
MARTIN: You know what I mean. I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer. And a lotta strange people.
