Moving Up in Student Affairs?
Hi Everyone-

I am an 'early career' student affairs professional. I have my Master's Degree and 5 years of post-master's experience in advising and program management in a community college. I am not rushed, but I want to start looking into applying for Director level positions, however, every posting I see requires years of managerial and supervisory experience. I am wondering how anyone with direct service experience ever has the opportunity to move into a director or dean level position without the supervisory experience? In my personal situation, I do supervise two student workers and 20 students who participate in a mentorship program, but I've never seen supervision of students as a consideration as leadership experience. Any advice/experience welcome!
