What are out-of-pocket expenses?
If a company says they will reimburse you for the out-of-pocket expenses what does this mean? 

I’m guessing it’s the money you spend getting to work such as train tickets. But what I don’t get is they say they will pay for gasoline as well as subsidence. But how do they count that? 

For example, if I travel to work one day and then after work I decided to take a 100 mile drive for the hell of it and then the next day gave them my receipts. Or in the morning because I know I get reimbursed, I order a big breakfast. How would they be able to tell with the gasoline part how much to reimburse me by because how would they know how much of it was used to actually get to work and what was used for personal reasons? 

I’m guessing with the food part they can check the time on the receipt and I guess it’s up to them to decide if I’m being fair on how much I’m eating for subsidence to qualify for getting reimbursed. But it’s really the gasoline part that’s confusing me.
