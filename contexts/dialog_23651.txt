WENDY: Yeah.
DANNY: Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
WENDY: Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
DANNY: Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
WENDY: Yeah, I know. It always takes a little time to make new friends.
DANNY: Yeah, I guess so.
WENDY: What about Tony? He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
