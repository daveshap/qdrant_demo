JOE: Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
POLIAKOFF: Nellie, get me long distance. What is it?
JERRY: It's about the Florida job.
POLIAKOFF: The Florida job?
JOE: Nellie told us about it.
JERRY: We're not too late, are we?
POLIAKOFF: What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here! Long distance? Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
JOE: You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
POLIAKOFF: The instruments are right, but you are not. I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
JERRY: What's wrong with us?
POLIAKOFF: You're the wrong shape. Goodbye.
JOE: The wrong shape? You looking for hunchbacks or something?
POLIAKOFF: It's not the backs that worry me.
JOE: What kind of band is this, anyway?
POLIAKOFF: You got to be under twenty-five -
JERRY: We could pass for that.
POLIAKOFF: - you got to be blonde -
JERRY: We could dye our hair.
POLIAKOFF: - and you got to be girls.
JERRY: We could -
JOE: No, we couldn't!
POLIAKOFF: William Morris!
JERRY: You mean it's a girls' band?
JOE: Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie! I ought to wring her neck!
POLIAKOFF: Yes, I'm holding on.
JERRY: Wait a minute, Joe. Lets talk this over. Why couldn't we do it? Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings. And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band? Grass skirts!
POLIAKOFF: What's with him - he drinks?
JOE: No. And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
JERRY: But, Joe - three weeks in Florida! We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
JOE: You've flipped your wig!
JERRY: Now you're talking! We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
JOE: Josephine and Geraldine! Come on!
POLIAKOFF: Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight - At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
JOE: We'll take it!
POLIAKOFF: You got it. It's six dollars a man. Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
JERRY: All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
JOE: It's twelve bucks. We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
POLIAKOFF: Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
JERRY: Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
