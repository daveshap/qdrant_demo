THOMAS: Are you okay? You just face planted!
KIMBERLY: I know how it feels to be dead.
CLEAR: What did you see?
KIMBERLY: I was dead. And came back to life. An EEG machine. Where's Eugene?
THOMAS: But it's over. Isabella's baby was the key. You saw her die and everything, right?
KIMBERLY: I don't...what if I made a mistake?
THOMAS: Impossible. She was on the onramp.
KIMBERLY: I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
THOMAS: Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
