SAM: Are you talking?
GEORGE: I was just thinking about my mom. She wouldn't leave him. I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses. I mean it was dark outside and in. But we never talked about it.
SAM: Sun glasses?
GEORGE: To hide a black eye.
SAM: Why wouldn't she leave?
GEORGE: I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
SAM: I would have killed him.
GEORGE: Everything would have been better if you had. You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother. I remember reading about her in the paper. They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
SAM: Do you ever wish you had done it?
GEORGE: I loved him too much.
SAM: After everything he did to you and your mom?
GEORGE: After everything.
SAM: That's so weird...
