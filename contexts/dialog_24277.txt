FRANK: What you readin'?
KARL: Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far. You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
FRANK: Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
KARL: I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
FRANK: I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
KARL: Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
KARL: Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
FRANK: Is that right?
KARL: I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
FRANK: You will? For sure?
KARL: Yeah.
FRANK: We'll be on teams, me and you?
KARL: Yessir.
FRANK: Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
KARL: I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
FRANK: We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
