DEREK: Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
SIDNEY: You’re not going to get away with this.
HALLIE: Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
DEREK: The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
HALLIE: A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
DEREK: We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
HALLIE: And now, drum roll please...
DEREK: Hope you’re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
HALLIE: A twist ending if you will.
DEREK: Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
HALLIE: ..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
DEREK: And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
HALLIE: So we found a compromise.
DEREK: Or it found us.
HALLIE: We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
DEREK: Just for you, Sid.
HALLIE: Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
DEREK: Oh yeah. We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion. Heads or tails?
HALLIE: Tails.
