Please help
So sometimes, when I go over to my girlfriend's house, we watch some Gordon Ramsay shows on Hulu because she really likes Hell's Kitchen and MasterChef and shit like that. All good. Well occasionally, we get a little frisky while watching, which has led to some not safe for work things more than a few times. Here's where the problem comes in: I was watching a clip of Kitchen Nightmares on YouTube when I start getting an erection all of a sudden. At first, I thought this was some kind of fluke, or a random boner. Happens all the time. But no, it happened again today, and I tried pausing the video until it went away, but the erection came back shortly after resuming. I don't believe I'm sexually attracted to Gordon Ramsay, but I think I associate his presence with my sexual experiences, and I'm afraid.
