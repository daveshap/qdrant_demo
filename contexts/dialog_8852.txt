KARRAS: Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
CHRIS: Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
KARRAS: I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
CHRIS: Like what?
KARRAS: Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
CHRIS: What else?
KARRAS: I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
CHRIS: I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
KARRAS: There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
CHRIS: You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
KARRAS: Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
CHRIS: No.
KARRAS: Did you know my mother died recently?
CHRIS: Yes I did, I'm sorry.
KARRAS: No, is Regan aware of it?
CHRIS: Not at all. Why d'you ask?
KARRAS: It's not important good night.
KARRAS: He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said Take this
REGAN/DEMON: What an excellent day for an exorcism.
KARRAS: You'd like that?
REGAN/DEMON: Intensely.
KARRAS: But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
REGAN/DEMON: It would bring us together.
KARRAS: You and Regan?
REGAN/DEMON: You and us.
KARRAS: Did you do that?
REGAN/DEMON: Uh Huh.
KARRAS: Do it again.
REGAN/DEMON: In time.
KARRAS: No now.
REGAN/DEMON: In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
KARRAS: You speak Latin?
REGAN/DEMON: Ego te abslovo.
KARRAS: Quod nomen mihi est?
REGAN/DEMON: Bon Jour.
KARRAS: Quod nomen mihi est?
REGAN/DEMON: La plume de ma tante.
KARRAS: How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
REGAN/DEMON: Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
REGAN/DEMON: What's that?
KARRAS: Holy water.
