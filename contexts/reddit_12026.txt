Life is taking its toll on me as of late.
For the last month my life has been on a sharp decline and honestly have no one to talk to about it. 

As of late April my sister totaled my Honda Civic leaving me with car loan that I have to finish paying for and no money to get another car. Thankfully my boss paid me for 2 weeks in advance for another car but with my credit being so bad I can't get an auto loan. 

I have my sister to co sign but that may not work since her credit isn't any better. 

With all that going on, the girl I had strong feelings for suddenly stopped talking to me a couple of days before the accident. I haven't spoken to her for about a month until last night where I reached out but that went nowhere. She replied a couple of times and stop replying back. 

Which hurts  I was there for her and all of her small time issues and I'm here with a serious unforeseen event happened to me and she nowhere in sight. I just wanted someone to ease this shitty situation that I find myself in. 

I feel I have no control with my life and everything is just going to shit. I have no girlfriend, no car and I'm carrying a lot of debt with an internship that barely paying me and on top of that im suffering from depression and can't talk to anyone about it. this is really taking a toll on my welL being. i don't know what to do to get my life back on track.
