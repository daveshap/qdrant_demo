NASPA Proposal Decisions
Hey!

Hope everyone is having a great first few weeks and that thinks are starting to slow down into a regular routine :)

Does anyone know how long the decisions usually take for conference proposals? I submitted my first national conf presentation proposal for NASPA and of course have the first year jitters haha. I imagine it won't be for some time since its such a large scale but I'm curious. 

Thanks for any help you can give!!
