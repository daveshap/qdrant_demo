JUD: I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
LOUIS: What did we do, Jud?
JUD: Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
LOUIS: I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
JUD: Wouldn't wash?
LOUIS: No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
JUD: Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself.
LOUIS: Can I have another one?
JUD: I guess it wouldn't hurt.
