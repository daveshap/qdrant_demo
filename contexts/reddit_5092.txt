How to overcome gap in employment
I just can’t seem to catch a break.  

I have had steady employment since I was legally allowed to work.  I decided to have a child and of course it was just financially better for the family to stay home rather than paying for daycare.  At about year 3 my child entered preschool and I couldn’t wait to go back to work.  Finally adult interaction!  With the help of a friend, I was able to secure a position.  About a year and a half later I was forced to resign due to a family medical emergency.  I did not want to leave but there was just no way around it.  Here we are a year later and medical emergency has been well taken care of, child is in elementary school, and I REALLY NEED to work.  Problem now is my gap in employment.  I am sending out my resume (professionally revised) and applications with no return.  I am starting to feel down on myself and fear I will never find something.  Is there any advise out there on how to overcome this?  Anyone go through something similar?
