JANE: Bastard, sneak, quitter.
AARON: Speaking.
JANE: I just found out. You didn't say anything to me? You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow. Please.
JANE: Why not try it for a few weeks?
AARON: Stop. Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help. My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland. The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks. Personally, I think he should aim higher.
JANE: Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
AARON: Ernie told this story. How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried. He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits. He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry. I should have quit this place three years ago.
JANE: You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
AARON: Let's go...
JANE: I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
AARON: Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
JANE: You are now required to sit here with me. Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
AARON: Okay, that's very easy. Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
JANE: Yes.
AARON: I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him... ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
JANE: You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
AARON: I hope so... No. I'm not really mad. I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
