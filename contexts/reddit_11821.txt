My best friend went to a major party school and it's changer her in to a stereotypical party girl.
She went to a huge state school that has a huge greek life and is known for partying a lot, I went to an urban school where partying isn't a huge deal. I don't want to be a prude or controlling but she's starting to become what me and her always hated when we were in grade school and high school. I don't want to get in to the details but it's really bothering me and I'm worried she will keep changing and eventually we won't be friends any more. We've been best friends for so long I don't want it to end like this.
