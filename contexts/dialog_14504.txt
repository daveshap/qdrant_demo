BRODY: What happened?
HOOPER: I want to check something. Hold my feet.
BRODY: Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
HOOPER: They must've hit something.
HOOPER: He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
BRODY: Why don't we just tow it in?
HOOPER: We will. There's something I've got to find out.
BRODY: Be careful, for chrissake.
BRODY: You all right?
HOOPER: A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
BRODY: No shark did that to a boat!
