NICK: Sal, we need you. We need you.
SAL: Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
NICK: We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
NICK: Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
SAL: Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
NICK: I know. It's like coming from the moon. Or Mars.
SAL: Did you go hunting.
NICK: Yeah.
SAL: Did you get one?
NICK: No.
SAL: You didn't get a deer?
NICK: I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
SAL: Where?
NICK: Here. Behind you.
