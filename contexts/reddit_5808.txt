I'm a recent grad. I work in the medical field. I got fired today after a month and a half on the job because they didn't see improvement...
I'm devesdated. I tried my best to improve every day. I don't think I was anywhere near perfect, but I honestly think they will have a hard time finding any recent grad as good as I was. How am I supposed to find success in a career where the higher ups don't allow time for noobies to get better? I was always on time, I reported to my higher ups when I needed to, and I was professional.

Idk... I'm feeling pretty down, and just feel like I'll never find success in this life.
