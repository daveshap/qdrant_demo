How do you make friends with people that you have no similar interests with?
It's been a while since I started going to a new school and I haven't been able to make friends. Most of my classmates are into sports and are actually quite popular at school but I'm more of an introvert and like to stay indoors. A lot of the time it's just small talk about school work and that's about it. How do I make friends?
