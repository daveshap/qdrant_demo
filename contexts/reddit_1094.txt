The thing about an anxiety disorder is that
You know it's stupid. 

You know with all your heart that it wasn't a big deal and that it should roll off of you.

&#x200B;

But that is where the disorder kicks in. 

Suddenly the small things is very big and it keeps growing in your head, and trying to escape from under skin.

You know with all of your heart that you're being ridiculous and You hate every minute of it.
