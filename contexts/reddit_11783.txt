I had a dream about my middle school girlfriend...
I hated middle school, and she was one of the only people to make me feel any better about myself, cause I was in a really bad mental state at the time. I remember how crushed I was when she broke up with me. It sent me spiraling into a void of darkness that I didn't get out of until, really, my sophomore year of high school. Now I'm not far from graduating. Last night, I had a dream that she came to me and apologized, and wanted me back. I know it sounds really corny, but I can't stop thinking about it. I've been sad ever since I got up. Why the hell does it bother me so much?
