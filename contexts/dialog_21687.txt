MADAME LECLERC: You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
MADELEINE: It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
COULMIER: In part, yes.
MADELEINE: He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
COULMIER: The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
MADELEINE: I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
COULMIER: Is that a promise you can truly keep?
COULMIER: Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
MADELEINE: I've you to look after me, haven't I?
