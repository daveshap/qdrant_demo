Two particles accelerating together Let's suppose we have two particles that move together (parallel), and they  have a certain acceleration, their  acceleration is  identical, so both are at relative rest. My doubt is, as they approach the speed of light, will the relative rest  remain always?  or at some point they will begin to observe a relative speed or acceleration?Thank you
