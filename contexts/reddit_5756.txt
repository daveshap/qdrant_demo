I have never had a job and I am almost 30 years old. I have just taken life day-by-day since I dropped out of college 8 years ago. I live with my parents and they pay for everything for now but eventually it will be unsustainable. What should I do for work?
I have spent the last 8 years just chilling on the computer, watching shows, watching YouTube, walking outside, eating snacks, napping. 

My standard day is like this:

* Wake up whenever, yolo 
* Make some oat meal
* Watch some Youtube videos
* Read reddit
* Take a nap from all the activity 
* Wake up, eat some pasta 
* Go for a walk outside 
* Shower, take another nap
* Wake up, eat some curry 
* Watch some movies with my dad or play video games with my dad
* Sleep for the night

On the weekends I go with my dad adventuring to the markets and fishing (I do not know how to drive, never got my driver's license). 

However, my dad pays for all my food and I get free place to sleep. Eventually this will end has he is pretty old (74 years of age). What should I do to get into the work force? Most of my credits are in accounting, but I hated that major and that's why I dropped out.
