HARRY: Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
VADA: No it's okay, I understand, really.
HARRY: Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
VADA: Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
HARRY: Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
VADA: Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
HARRY: Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
VADA: Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
HARRY: Seriously?
VADA: Seriously.
HARRY: Great.
