FIRST HENCHMAN: Those two musicians from the garage!
SPATS: They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here. Come on.

JOE: First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
SPATS: What happened?
FIRST HENCHMAN: Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
SPATS: Where were you guys?
