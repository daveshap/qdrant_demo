VISSER: ...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
MARTY: Got a job for you.
VISSER: ...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
MARTY: It's not strictly legal.
VISSER: If the pay's right I'll do it.
MARTY: It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
VISSER: Yeah? Well how irritated are you?
VISSER: ...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
MARTY: Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
VISSER: You want me to kill 'em.
MARTY: I didn't say that. Well?
VISSER: Well what?
MARTY: What do you think?
VISSER: You're an idiot.
MARTY: So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
VISSER: I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
