WILDER: This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron. Had some killings here. I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
STATE POLICEMAN: On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard. But now, no way. Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour. Bring him in yourself.
WILDER: Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
STATE POLICEMAN: Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
WILDER: This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
STATE POLICEMAN: So shoot him. Won't have to feed him that way --

CORBETT: Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
CORBETT: Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man. Other guy drew first.
WILDER: If that was all, fine. But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
CORBETT: I'll get loose before that plane comes.
WILDER: Don't try me. I'll kill you if it comes to it.
NEFF: Mr. Desmond! Arthur Neff. Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan. Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
ERIC: Sure.
NEFF: Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel! Here, this is for you.
