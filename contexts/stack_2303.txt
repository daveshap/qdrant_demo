How can I use both my controller's analog stick and D-pad in a SNES emulator? I was in the mood to play Chrono Trigger again and rather than put up with the disc loading times on my PS1 Final Fantasy Chronicles version, I figured I would just use an emulator.Naturally I would prefer to use a controller rather than keyboard/mouse, so I grabbed my trusty 360 controller. Here's where things get tricky: I would like to be able to use both the analog stick (which is ideal for running around) and the D-pad (which is perfect for navigating menus) on the controller.I tried SNES9x, and it doesn't appear to support mapping multiple buttons to the same input. I tried the latest version of bsnes/higan and it did support that feature, but my computer just isn't powerful enough to run the accuracy profile (the only profile available in current versions) without obnoxious audio problems. I tried the last version of bsnes/higan with the balanced/performance profiles (v0.98) and of course it doesn't support that feature.Is there a performant SNES emulator that has that feature? Alternately is there a free &amp; reliable utility that will help me achieve this functionality?
