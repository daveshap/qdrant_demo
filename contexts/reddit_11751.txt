My Mom
Hey guys, I just need some advice about how to deal with my situation.  I am 19 and was adopted at 12.  I went off to college and I'm in my sophomore year and I love it.  Because of Coronavirus I have had to move back into my house earlier than expected.  I have severe Anxiety and I hate being home because it's the worst place for me to be.  My mom is super harsh and very blunt about everything.  I still get yelled at like a little kid for the dumbest reasons.  I know she loves me but at the same time I always want to not be here.  I hate being home because she's on my back 24/7.  She says she loves me but it's hard to really believe that when I have anxiety attacks on how to deal with stuff.  I really want to stand up for myself but I'm terrified of doing it.  I also want to leave because I don't want to be here because of everything.  I feel so much better by myself but I don't have anywhere to go til August.  She even threatened me of getting kicked out if I don't have a job by Friday.  I had an interview today and she yelled at me for wearing khaki shorts.  Like the job was for a dishwashing position.  She screams at me not even because I'm doing anything wrong but she's stressed about work.  She even hates my gf and I've been with her for 1year now and like she is the best person ever and I love her so much and my mom fucking hates her for no fucking reason.  I just need advice guys thank you for reading this.  Hope you all have a great day!
