Should I apply using a recruiter or directly (already have reached out to head of department myself)
Hi all,

I'm in a bit of a tricky situation. I am deciding whether to use a recruiter (that I have been working fairly closely with and I know does a good job) for a job posting or whether to wait and apply directly.

This is a company that I have been referred to by someone who used to work there and I was able to get in contact with the head of the department through LinkedIn and then email. The head was very responsive and mentioned that they would have some roles opening up soon. This makes me think that I have at least a bit of a good shot of getting an interview myself soon.

Today, my recruiter emails me letting me know that this company is about to open up some roles and is asking whether she can submit me. These roles are about to be posted so there's no way I can say I've already applied to them.

Should I use the recruiter or just wait it out and try to do it directly. If I get hired directly, the company would not have to pay a recruiting fee which makes me think I could negotiate a higher salary. I don't want to piss of this recruiter though as she has been doing a good job and has gotten me some phone interviews so far.

What would you all do?
