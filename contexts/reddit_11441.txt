I'm 22, i still live with my mother, have no job, no car, lost my girlfriend of 3 yrs and can't even bring myself to do anything to change my life.
Every month I say to myself "next month I will find a job". My parents give me just enough money to go out with friends once or twice a week. I feel bad for still taking their money. I can't get enough motivation to do anything to change my life. I don't want to do some shit job for a low pay, even if I'm aware that I won't get anything better without any experience. I have never worked in my entire life. I have a brother and a sister and I feel that I should start living on my own already. I just can't get my shit together and this makes me feel really depressed, still somehow I'd rather sit on reddit than look for a job or something. I feel like a parasite. I should support my family. I don't smoke pot or anything, I am a normal, rather popular guy, I mean I have friends and all. I know this is not right but somehow I find work humiliating. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know what to do to get myself together, find a job, buy a car, rent a flat or something and start supporting my family like I should.
