How can I get a job over the summer as a college student during Covid?
Hello!  I have a few questions on how I should go about asking for a job during this pandemic.  I've just finished my sophomore year of college, and am trying to find a part time job to help pass these next two months before I go back to school, as this next semester is starting early.  I was considering working as a retail sales associate, as I could not find volunteer work/jobs at any funeral homes or coroners offices (I'm a forensic biology major).  So, reddit, here's my question:  How should I go about asking for a job during this pandemic?  Should I call or should I dress nicely and go to the store I'd like to work at and ask to speak to the manager about applying?  I want to make a good impression, so avoiding early mistakes is a key factor I want to consider.  My previous experience has been working in most parts of a performing arts theatre, mainly selling tickets to customers.  I've looked online for job opportunities, but it's been kind of overwhelming, and I'd just like to talk to someone in charge of the place I'd like to work.  I can answer any questions you may have. All advice is welcome and I thank you for taking the time to read this.
