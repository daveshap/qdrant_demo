I am a loser, a big failure and forever will be.
I have always been unable to talk with people. I've had no friends ever, fuck I can't even talk to most of my family. I didn't think much of it when I was younger. But now I'm going to college and it's hitting me hard how much of a failure I am. I dropped out of my first one because of crippling anxiety. Now I joined another one far from home. Now I feel trapped. I'm scared of humans. I look at myself in the mirror and I see an ugly subhuman being unworthy of any love or respect. I know if I go on I won't be a success in life, I won't be happy, I will always be scared of everything and depressed all the time. My mind is too fucked up over the years that I don't think it's even possible to cure. All I can think of now is death. It gives me relief to think of it. So I will soon drive off into a lake and die and hopefully make it look like an accident.

Edit: Thanks for all the kind words guys. Even though I don't know a single one of you, it feels good that some of you can understand what I've been going through all my life and took the time to respond to me.
