AUSTIN: Where am I?
BASIL EXPOSITION: You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
AUSTIN: WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
BASIL EXPOSITION: The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
AUSTIN: Yes, I'm having trouble controlling... THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
BASIL EXPOSITION: You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
AUSTIN: Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
BASIL EXPOSITION: A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
AUSTIN: Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
BASIL EXPOSITION: We won, Austin.
AUSTIN: Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya! Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
