18 year old - deciding a major in the U.K.

This whole time I've been focusing on business management/marketing as a field in university and I keep hearing things on reddit about how it is too broad. I think one of the main reasons I leaned towards this was because personally, I love talking to people, not necessarily socialising but persuading, negotiating, advertising things (in real life). I seriously think I'd be more passionate being a door to door salesmen instead of a person who sits behind his computer all day. I say this because, from the ages 10-16, I always sat in front of my computer for multiple hours a day after school, I played games, edited videos, all that. I loved it, but then after that, due to an environmental change, it forced me to be more extroverted outside of school time, it made me want to focus on becoming the best version of myself, I started lifting, properly talking, I gained confidence and stopped feeling sluggish. I know that...because during this lockdown, I've felt more sluggish than ever in the past 2 years and now I know why.

So anyway, I researched a bunch of fields and their experience, though I did not do well in school with Maths, I see that Computer Science is a highly demanded major especially for making money, though it does not appeal to me I could be willing to put in the work, as I got quite disappointed after searching up any business related degree and seeing it get bashed and people regretting doing it.

If anyone has any opinions, tips and advice for if they were in my position feel free to let me know!
