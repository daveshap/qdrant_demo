is it normal that my company's hr is really unresponsive ?
I had the interview with company back in Nov 2019, they kept saying the offer was on the way but I didn't get it till January. I get it that they could be slow because their CEO was travelling on Christmas.  But in general their HR is extremely unresponsive. After singing offer, giving information on background check, they told me they will let me know what to do on the first day close to my start date(which is next Monday and 2 business days away). Last week I sent an email to the HR to ask for some updates on background check, no response. By today I haven't heard any thing from them so I called the HR, his phone rang twice and went to voice mail, no call back at all. Now I am just wondering what's happening and I already booked everything.   It is my first job, I wonder if it's normal that HR is like that, and what I can do ?  Thank you!
