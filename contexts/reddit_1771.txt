Just a warning, the Duke ED Admits Group chat is a shit show rn
Apparently, some guy who wasn't going to Duke found his way into the group chat and lied about having BONE CANCER. The dude really sold it too, he had been VERY active in the chat for 2-3 weeks before dropping his "news" and changed his insta bio too. All of this was just to get sympathy from girls, and he also tried getting some of us to buy and send him merch and raise money for him for "surgery". We have a student intern from the admissions (or some other thing through the school) department in the group chat (shoutout babu) who got his hands on an admitted students directory and he exposed him to everyone and now the group chat is in shambles. So be skeptical of the group chats. Also, be suspicious if a dude named Lawerence joins your chats.
