ELLIE: Peter... What is going on? Has everyone gone completely insane?
PETER: That's one way of putting it. Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe. Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
ELLIE: But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone! The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at... ... the tape...
ELLIE: ... I don't understand it. All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
KITZ: Is that your official response?
ELLIE: I don't have an official response, Michael. All I have are the same questions you have.
