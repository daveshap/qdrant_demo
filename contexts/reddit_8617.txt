Is there any precedent for the mass impeachment of the West Virginia Supreme Court justices?
Yesterday, [a committee of the West Virginia House](https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/politics/wv-house-committee-approves-articles-of-impeachment-against-justices/article_f4795b83-ba20-5ac8-a267-aeb4b10060fa.html) approved articles of impeachment against the 4 remaining justices of the [Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Appeals_of_West_Virginia) (the state's highest court) relating to excess spending on various things, most notably of the judges' offices.

Is there any historical precedent at the federal or state levels for impeaching all the members of a multi-member body like this?  The article linked above indicates that Gov. Justice would appoint replacements.  How does this process work and is it immediate?  If there were a simultaneous vacancy of all of the justices of the court, how would appeals be resolved?
