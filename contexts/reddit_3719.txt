This shit makes me feel hella insecure
So 2 weeks ago at work I was talking to my co worker and asked her if we could go on a date together I knew her 2 years ago when I first started working here. She said “no, I’m a lesbian.” I immediately apologized to her “ I’m very sorry I asked” but just a few moments later I hear her and her friends laughing and pointing fingers at me saying and I quote: “he must be hella stupid if he thinks I’m gonna date his dumb ugly ass.”
