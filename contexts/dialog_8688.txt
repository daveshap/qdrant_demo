NAOMI'S VOICE: That's me.
JOEL: There you are. Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
NAOMI: Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
JOEL: I had a good time last night. I really did.
NAOMI: So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
JOEL: We'll speak soon.
NAOMI: 'Night.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: What took you so long?
JOEL: I just walked in.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Hmmm. Do you miss me?
JOEL: Oddly enough, I do.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
JOEL: I guess so.
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
CLEMENTINE: Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
JOEL: I don't know.
