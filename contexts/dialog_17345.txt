OSCAR: Hey...you're here. They told me you're here...and you're here. How are you?
CHARLIE: Ok, how's everything going?
OSCAR: Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
CHARLIE: No.
OSCAR: I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that?
CHARLIE: What pipes?
OSCAR: What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
OSCAR: Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing. There is nothing to give him. No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
CHARLIE: That bad, huh?
OSCAR: I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
CHARLIE: Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
OSCAR: Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that. I don't need this aggravation. I'm getting old.
CHARLIE: He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
OSCAR: Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him. Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place. And tell me why should I care? I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems. I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
CHARLIE: I don't understand, where's Groppi?
OSCAR: I should know? His wife don't even know. Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know. I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
CHARLIE: My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
OSCAR: What can I say?
