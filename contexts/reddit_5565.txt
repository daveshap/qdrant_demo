Generally, how much weight do preferred qualifications hold?
I applied to this one position and the description and requirements never really specify a certain amount of experience. Everything seems pretty basic and entry level. Then the preferred qualifications take the posting on a drastic turn and list 8+ years of experience in the industry the company specializes in, which is different from the field the position itself falls under. Would this position still be considered entry level?
