JOHN: Grace . . . Grace?
GRACE: After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.
JAKE: Who was that on the phone?
GRACE: Wrong number.
JAKE: You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace?
GRACE: I put up new drapes, Jake.
JAKE: I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
GRACE: You never said anything. About the drapes.
JAKE: They look nice.
GRACE: You haven't even looked at them once.
JAKE: They look nice.
GRACE: I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought you would like the colors.
JAKE: Uh-huh
JAKE: What the hell you looking at, girl?
GRACE: Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.
