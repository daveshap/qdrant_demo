DETECTIVE: What! What are you talking about?
FLORENCE: The body of Joan Gale!
DETECTIVE: Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
FLORENCE: I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
DETECTIVE: Are you giving me this straight?
FLORENCE: Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
