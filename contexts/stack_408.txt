Backing up specific directory with it's content to remote location I'm running Ubuntu 17.04, hosted on ovh and accessed to remotely through PuTTy (Terminal only, NO GUI).My intention is to backup a single directory containing a running server, with all it's sub-files/directories towards a remote location where various backups would be stored (Up to a limit).How often?: At least every 24h.Remotely where?: Not sure, Some external service like Google Drive It may depend on how it's done. Free + More space is best.Restoration processes are unnecessary, all I'd like is for that directory to be sent to a remote location where it can later be manually examined/recovered in case of any damage to the main OS or files.I don't need to backup the whole system, just that directory and it's content.What I've already checked:Ubuntu's main guide for \"BackupYourSystem\" I still felt like I had to ask here as I'm fairly new.Some of the programs listed on that guide, and other tutorials which I wasn'tentirely convinced by.Could I get some advice on how to do this? I'm one week new to ubuntu. Thanks!Any further information needed I will gladly provide.
