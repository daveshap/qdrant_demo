Am I faking being depressed for attention?
I at this point have started to doubt if I'm just doing everything for attention. I do things like venting to close friends when I'm feeling way too deep down. I sometimes just want to see if they care because a lot of my "thoughts" surround the fact that nobody actually cares about me. That everybody hates me. Sometimes I've gotten "mad" at people for acting like they don't care. Because everyone says they care but never shows it. I get mad about the fact that they pretend they care cause if they don't, they should just tell me that. Cause deep inside it's what I want. So I can prove to myself that I'm the failure I believe I am. So I can finally kill myself without the guilt. I'm very confused. Am I faking it??
