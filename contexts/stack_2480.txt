Analysing and mapping intersection of layers with one layer with overlapping Polygons I have one layer (a_layer) with approx 400 overlapping polygons and no more data as the fid. I want to analyse how many countys (b_layer) are coverd by each polygon of tha a_layer.I was thinking to do that with the report builder of QGIS.How to do that with python scripts and/or modeler in QGIS?How to fit this in report builder?
