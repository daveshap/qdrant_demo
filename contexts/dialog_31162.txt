SUZIE: I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it. What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
SAM: We?
SUZIE: Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
SAM: How...
SUZIE: Walter. He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years. I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold. I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass. What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
SAM: I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
KELLY: I'm running away.
SAM: You think that's wise?
KELLY: Um-huh. And guess what else? I have toys.
