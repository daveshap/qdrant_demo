My writing skills are very poor
So, English is not my first language, but I grew up in the US. I don't think I built those writing skills in high school. Now in college, I have improved â€”but not enough for graduate school. 

Other than reading and writing what are other things I can do to improve? Any of you in a similar situation as me?
