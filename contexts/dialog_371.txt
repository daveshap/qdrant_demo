WELLES: What are these?
ANGRY DEALER: Mixed hard bondage. Rape films. Sick shit. Buy five, get one free.
WELLES: Anything harder?
ANGRY DEALER: There's nothing harder.
WELLES: Snuff?
ANGRY DEALER: What you see is what I got, mister.
WELLES: You know where I can get it? I have a lot of money to spend.
ANGRY DEALER: There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
