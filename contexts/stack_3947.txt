how to calculate average tenure of a worker in any factory I have tenure data for workers who have left the factory and also who are still working in the factory. I need to calculate average time spent by worker in the factory?. what data should i consider active workers or inactive workers.when i considered active workers:avg tenure = sum of number of years completed by active workers / total no of active workers.i.e 3.5 years as the average number i am getting.is this correct method ? because this is an on going event. some workers might have  just joined the factory so their tenure will be 0.1 to 0.9 years. this might pull the average down.please let me know how to calculate average when the event is still going on.
