Today I ate in a restaurant by myself
I’ve had anxiety for around 6 years now, sometimes it is more debilitating than others and I’ve had a phobia of choking on my food for the past 3 years. Eating out tends to be a really difficult process for me even when I’m in company I’m comfortable with, I’ll often end up giving up and not finishing my meal because I think I’m going to choke on every mouthful. I’ve never eaten in a restaurant on my own in my life. 

Today though I thought “fuck it” I’m not living my life around this fear anymore, so I popped into a small Thai restaurant near my home for lunch. I sat at my table and I ordered some food and I ate. It was overwhelmingly liberating, I could have cried. It wasn’t easy to eat but I finished my plate and I’ve never been more proud of myself.
