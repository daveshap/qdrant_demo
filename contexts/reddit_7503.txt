When did you start to look for a supervisor?
I'm the first person in my family to apply to graduate school and I'm honestly pretty confused about some of the process. 

I've applied to a Master's program, been admitted, and will start this Fall. Was I supposed to email potential supervisors first, or is this something that I do now, or does the search begin once the Fall session actually begins? Can't find much info online with regard to my program.

Thank you so much, and sorry if this is a weird question.
