CHRISTINE: Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
JACK: Well, then put him at the singles table.
CHRISTINE: The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
JACK: Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
CHRISTINE: Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
JACK: I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
CHRISTINE: I'm not going to call every five minutes, but this is important.
JACK: Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
CHRISTINE: Why are you being so defensive?
JACK: I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
CHRISTINE: I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
JACK: Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
CHRISTINE: Bye.
JACK: I love you.
CHRISTINE: Bye.
