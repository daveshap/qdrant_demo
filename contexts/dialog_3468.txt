AMOS: See! The big guy likes it.
EDWARD: I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
AMOS: Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
EDWARD: I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
AMOS: Jesus, kid. Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
EDWARD: Yes!
AMOS: I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
EDWARD: Who is she? Where does she live?
AMOS: Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
EDWARD: What do you mean? You don't even know me.
AMOS: Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
EDWARD: I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
EDWARD: Someone stole my backpack.
AMOS: Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
