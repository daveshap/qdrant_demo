How to gracefully hand in your two weeks?
I’ve been working at this place for almost 2 years and I recently got another job offer.

My boss annoyed me today and I’m incredibly motivated right now to hand in my two weeks, which I was going to do anyway, but this will speed up the process and keep me from chickening out.

They are short staffed right now, but it’s not my problem, and they’ve had plenty of time to fix that and haven’t.

I’ve written it all out, but how do I walk into my supervisors office and hand it in? What do I say? Thanks in advance!
