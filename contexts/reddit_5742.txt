Is getting fired during probation a massive setback in my career?
I got fired after 3 months in my 6 months probation period and got told that my skills are not a good fit for the company. I'm really devastated by this since this was my first job after my master's. I'm in the job hunt again and do I leave this job out my CV? Or put it and explain that it wasn't a good fit for both me and the employer? Will this be a big setback in my career or can I get a job again soon? 

Hoping to hear some experiences for encouragement.
