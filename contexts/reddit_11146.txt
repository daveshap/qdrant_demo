Ive been living in this guys attic.
Background Info - Recently lost my job and have been looking for work. Live in southwest usa.

Recently ive taken up residence in this family's attic. I know it isnt ideal, but its all I got. When they arnt home, I get to use their bathroom and kitchen. I do my best not to disturb anything.

I know its illegal, but anything is better than homelessness.

Here's the problem, this 15 year old kid is on to me. Currently trying to make it seem like im just a racoon or some animal (although the kid would have to be very gullible, we dont have racoons in the southwest lol).

Any advice? Have any of you been in a similar situation? How can I not get cought?

Edit: Animal controll is on their way. They are in for a surprise.

Edit: I found the poop sock
