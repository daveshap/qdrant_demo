First time dating without having sex immediately and I’m excited
Edit: Its completely fine having sex immediately. I’m not saying its bad, thats how most of my relationships/fwbs went. Its ok, its not wrong, its not better, not worse. Im just excited to try something different.

So my first boyfriend and I we just fucked the first time we met, then afterwards went to the movies and then I started falling in love with him. It lasted 11 months and was overall pretty great but there was no build up or anything, just went right into it. I don’t regret that, it was a very positive experience, but now I’m going out on dates with a guy and I don’t see sex coming up immediately and I’m a bit excited.

It is going to be really interesting taking it slow and just feeling the build up of moments, and sort of the rush when it does. I don’t know, just thinking about that makes me giddy. Thats all. Have a nice day :)
