PARKER: What are you doing?
MADISON: Checking my pulse. It's elevated. You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
PARKER: You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
MADISON: This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.

PARKER: I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
MADISON: I'm still working on it.
MADISON: Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
PARKER: I've been in prison, remember?
MADISON: The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
PARKER: Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
MADISON: I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
PARKER: ... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
MADISON: I am impressed.
PARKER: For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
MADISON: Who said that?
PARKER: Hamlet. What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
MADISON: He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
MADISON: Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
PARKER: Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
MADISON: But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
