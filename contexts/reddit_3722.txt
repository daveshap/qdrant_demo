Something I learned from my recent breakup, that I’d rather not forget.
We go into a relationship, beaming with joy and enthusiasm for the future. We don’t know this but we are subconsciously expecting this person to be exactly who we imagine them to be in our day dreams, in between steamy/funny texts and calls. We unknowingly place unrealistic expectations onto these people. We expect them to be someone that our mind has imagined up. Nine out of ten times, we don’t even have a clue as to who they really are. This is just one reason relationships fail. There are so many others. For a relationship to work, it needs to stand up to so many challenges.

When you do finally get to know the person for who they really are, keep in mind that you too have your flaws. No one is perfect and nothing in this world is perfect, so how could your significant other be perfect? Remember that only you can provide yourself with a love that is truly fulfilling. No other person can give this to you, so please stop waiting for and expecting it from your SO. Remember to stop focusing on the negatives of your SO and start focusing on the negatives you yourself are guilty of possessing. Remember to stop yourself from over analyzing small details that you know mean nothing in comparison to the big picture. Remind yourself to stop placing blame on others, ask yourself “what part do I play?” Every time you think of a bad experience with a significant other, ask yourself, what did I do to fix things? If you go around placing blame and pointing fingers, you have already lost the battle. Focus on yourself.

Some of you may already know this, but struggle with applying it to real life situations, like I do. It’s hard. But I hope the reaffirmation helps it stick.
