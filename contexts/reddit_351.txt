Trying to get out of a toxic friendship.
Hi! First-time poster on Reddit here. I am having a bit of a struggle with this friend of mine she has become a toxic individual who I think is just a compulsive liar. I mean she lies a lot. Like she has told me this numerous times that she is either a foreign princess or some sort of a rich millionaire and uses all of this expensive makeup. Which I know for a fact is all bullshit and crap she made up.

I would ask her simple questions trying to prob this lie in a way like what was her official title and where did she live and what did her castle look like, stuff like that. And you know what she did she would either blatantly avoid the truth or google some image of a palace and call it hers. That type of crap. And then she would go about talking about her mom and all this family stuff which for the most part is her just over exaggerating the story. I have met her mom and she is a really nice although strict lady.

the truth that I am getting at here is that I have tried all sorts of methods to deliberately remove myself from her but nothing has worked and the only other option I have is just not talking to her which would mean not talking to my actual friends who I enjoy the company of.  I really need advice on how I should deal with this situation and what I should do next.
