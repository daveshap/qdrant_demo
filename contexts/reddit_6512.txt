Considered for employment just because I can translate
So this business hired me because I can translate both English and Spanish. As soon as I got a call from one of the supervisors, he said the name of a company everyone is aware of: World Financial Group. It’s a company associated with Transamerica and Primerica, which recruits people into making them recruit other people in hopes they get even more people and etc. reviews have said that they scam people out of $100 ($500 depending on state) into putting money for their training and other packages. They also request credit and debit card info, SSN, and birthdays. So here’s my question, should I consider it or be aware of their business practices?

Edit: there’s a video on WFG. You should check out AlwaysMarco. He pretends to be interested to exploit them of their pyramid schemes
