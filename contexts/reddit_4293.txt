Nobody cares how much YOU like someone - let's just put that out there. If that person doesnt reciprocate, then let it go...please!


...If someone blocks you on IG, dont reach out through fb or Twitter "just to explain" yourself. Do not chase them, dont try harder, dont convince yourself that if you keep asking, they may say yes the 25th time. 


...Dont go home and become obsessed with them and read into every single move they make, mistaking it as 'interest' - then negatively citiquing that persons choices in dating (just because he/she didnt select you). 


...Dont not send gifts or get friends involved in trying to convince this person to change their mind. 


...If you approach someone and they turn their back to you, play with their phone, or blatantly ignore you - walk away. Do not linger there and continue trying to have a discussion. 


...And lastly, do not take on the negative attitude that you are owed a chance by that person all because YOU have convinced yourself your feelings are deep and you have unnecessarily invested so much time in someone that doesnt care for you...


Self awareness is VERY important!!! It is the difference in understanding that your behavior has gone too far and that your feelings may not be reciprocated... vs...avoiding a harassment charge because you didnt stop hitting on someone who made themselves clear.
