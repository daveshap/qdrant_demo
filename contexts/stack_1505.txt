How does the power station compensates for the current that flows down to earth due to domestic body-current faults? I know current flows in a loop and energy is used to move it in a loop. Now suppose we get a single phase AC (220/120V) electricity supply for our home and we have earth connection to prevent shocks from the current that leaks on to the metal body of our appliances.So we have a circuit loop in which current (electron present in the wire) flows from station to house and back to the station (the direction of electron is opposite to that of conventional current flow). Also there are fixed number of free electrons present in this circuit loop.Now consider a situation where somehow current leaks to the body of a appliance and goes to ground instead of returning back to the power station( due to earthing).How is this lost current compensated by the power station which never receives it back ?I was talking about conventional current  so if you talk about electrons I can reframe the question as how does the power station deal with the extra electrons that flows from ground(earth) back to the loop?Note: I know in the real scenario there are three-phase wires from the power station and a local step down transformer steps it down and provides us with 1 or 2 phases which forms a micro loop between the transformer and the house so the situation remains the same (wouldn't it?), although contained to the move loop instead of the giant loop.
