GORDO: Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
MILES: I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?

JAKE: Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
GORDO: You sure?
