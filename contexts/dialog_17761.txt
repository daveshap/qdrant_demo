KAY: She didn't even know you. .
JAY: I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot. And what if I wanted to see her again? I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
KAY: Such a shame, too. Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
JAY: Hey, I was workin' her. I was workin' my thing.
KAY: Just so I understand... you're thing" is... acting like an idiot? Or is it actually being an idiot? Besides--"
JAY: I know, I know. I read the manual. No attachments. We work alone. Blah. blah.
KAY: If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone. Believe me, you get used to it.
JAY: I think you're too used to it. If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
KAY: You don't know the half of it.
JAY: What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
KAY: I taught kindergarten.
JAY: Ha ha. No, really.
KAY: It was a long time ago.-
