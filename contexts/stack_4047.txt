I planning to to travel to Croatia and Germany as a tourist. Do I need two separate visas or one multiple-entry Schengen visa? I am entering the Schengen area from Croatia, staying there for 10 days. I will then travel to Germany for 5 days and exit from Vienna airport (no stay in Austria). Do I need to apply separate visas for the Schengen area and Croatia or will a multiple-entry visa applied at the German consulate do?Thanks in advance.
