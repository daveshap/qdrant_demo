How can I talking to my boss about excessive travel?
Hi all,

I am a software developer for a large consulting firm. I was told during the hiring process that it would require up to 50% travel which I am okay with. However, I am currently on a project that requires me to fly 700 miles to the client site 4 days a week every week. I leave my house for the airport every Sunday at noon and return home every Thursday around 10pm. 

I love my job but the traveling but being away from home for the majority of every week is mentally and emotionally draining. This position is perfect for me in every way except for the heavy travel requirements. My current project will be wrapping up soon and I am trying to decide how to approach the topic of traveling less in the future with my manager. 

My boss is a fantastic person and he really cares about his employees. I feel like I could talk to him about this, but I donâ€™t want it to reflect poorly on me or come across as laziness or insubordination. 

How would you suggest approaching this situation?


Thanks!
