KAFKA: No, I don't. I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
GABRIELA: Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
KAFKA: The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
GABRIELA: Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here? This will always be the ghetto.
KAFKA: He wasn't robbed. He was identified by his wallet.
GABRIELA: And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
KAFKA: When I have no reason to doubt.
GABRIELA: The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests. For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
KAFKA: -- What could he have done to warrant that?
GABRIELA: Are you free tonight?
KAFKA: Tonight?
GABRIELA: There are some people I'd like you to meet. Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
KAFKA: ... All right.
GABRIELA: You almost married recently, didn't you?
KAFKA: Last year. I -- it was broken off.
GABRIELA: Eduard wanted to marry me.
KAFKA: And you ...?
GABRIELA: I'm suspicious of men who want to marry. I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
KAFKA: -- I don't know the Musil district.
GABRIELA: You won't have any trouble finding it.
