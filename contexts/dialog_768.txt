JOEY: You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
MURDOCK: I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
OVEUR: No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
MURDOCK: All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
MURDOCK: I'm an airline pilot. Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
JOEY: I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
MURDOCK: Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
JOEY: ...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
MURDOCK: We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
JOEY: ...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
MURDOCK: The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
