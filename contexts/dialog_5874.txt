EVELYN: Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
GITTES: How did you find out?
EVELYN: My husband.
GITTES: He told you?
GITTES: And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
EVELYN: I was grateful.
GITTES: You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
EVELYN: Why?
GITTES: Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay. When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
EVELYN: Unless what?
GITTES: She's cheating on him.
