BOBBY: I came for Grace.
JAKE: You came to take my wife from me?
JAKE: Shhh! Liar.
BOBBY: It's the truth, Jake.
JAKE: That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
BOBBY: Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today. Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
JAKE: You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
BOBBY: Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace. You were going to give me thirteen-thousand. Give me two-hundred. I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy. But I need the the money. I've got to have the money.
