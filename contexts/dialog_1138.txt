CAVALIERI: Did you know? Had you heard?
SALIERI: What?
CAVALIERI: The marriage!
SALIERI: Well, what does it matter to you?
CAVALIERI: Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
CAVALIERI: How was I? Tell me honestly.
SALIERI: You were sublime.
CAVALIERI: What did you think of the music?
SALIERI: Extremely clever.
CAVALIERI: Meaning you didn't like it.
MOZART: Oh - excuse me!
CAVALIERI: Is her mother still lying on the floor?
MOZART: No, she's fine.
CAVALIERI: I'm so relieved.
SALIERI: Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
MOZART: Did you like it, then?
SALIERI: How could I not?
MOZART: It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
CAVALIERI: Is she a good fuck?
MOZART: What??
CAVALIERI: I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
