DOLORES: Oh, a ladies man, huh?
BABY HERMAN: My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
VALIANT: My problem is I come here to drink in peace. So if you don't mind...
BABY HERMAN: C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you? I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
DOLORES: Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
VALIANT: Thanks for the vote of confidence.
BABY HERMAN: And another thing, the paper said no will was found. But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
VALIANT: So where is it then?
BABY HERMAN: Somebody took it from him. That's what this whole thing's about.
DOLORES: The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
VALIANT: Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
BABY HERMAN: My hunch is it was Maroon. He always was after Acme's property.
VALIANT: Yeah? Does he wear pants this color?
BABY HERMAN: No. But neither does Roger. That's Diablo Red. Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
DOLORES: Well, I'll be...
BABY HERMAN: So what's your next move, Valiant?
