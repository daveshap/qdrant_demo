I can’t even remember how it felt like not suffering from anxiety fuelled depression, I’m 35 and having the worst time of my life. Today, I forced myself to go to the gym despite my inner voice saying I can’t. Feeling great about it.
Thanks to you all, kind internet strangers! My heart feels so warm thanks to your sincere comments; everyone who shared their own stories and everyone who told their experiences, thank you! We are not alone. 

P.S. My very first award, thanks.
