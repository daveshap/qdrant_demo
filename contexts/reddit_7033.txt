How do i get into the IT field?
I've only got experience with Microsoft Office and Windows. Been using computers my whole 24 years of life. I couldn't afford the SAT in high school, and my grades were average. I've only ever had one job at a warehouse (5 years now sadly.) 

Where do I start? Should I jump into a trade school? Should I find a better warehouse job and use that to put me through school? Go to a community college and get my credentials? Should I look for an entry level position with on field training? 

I'm currently working a dead end job at a K-mart DC, staying with my parents and working a full time job. I want to take care of my girlfriend with a job that actually has a **future.** How do i begin this journey? I'd prefer anything in Southern California if possible. I'm sorry I don't know where else to ask...
