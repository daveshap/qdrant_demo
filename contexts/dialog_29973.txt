BOBBY: Accident.
DARRELL: You got to be more careful. Hands is important. Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
BOBBY: I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
DARRELL: Diner up a piece. Not much, but us simple folk like it.
BOBBY: I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
