Remove duplicate mails from mailing list (IMAP) If I write to a mailing list, some people reply to the list and additional put me into CC.This way I receive the reply twice:once via mailing listonce via CCIn thunderbird (Ubuntu) and K9 (Android) I would like to see the mail only once, not twice.Is there a way to achieve this goal?I think a solution plugin for thunderbird won't help, since if I don't start my ubuntu PC, the thunderbird plugin can't clean up, and I will see the duplicates in K9.I access the mails via IMAP.
