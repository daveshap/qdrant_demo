JESSIE: He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff? Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
FRANK: I don't know.
JESSIE: If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
FRANK: Hal will have my head for this.
JESSIE: And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
FRANK: I admit, I can be bought.
HAL: On top of the peak.
TRAVERS: It looks like a winding route.
QUALEN: Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
HAL: The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass. Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
FRANK: Jessie, Jessie, copy?
JESSIE: I copy.
FRANK: Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
JESSIE: If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'. You sound like a mother hen.
FRANK: Rooster! Forget the hen stuff. Be safe, honey. Over.
