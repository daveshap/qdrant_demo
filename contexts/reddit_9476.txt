Just got a Christmas tree and decorations for $6
Husband and I haven't had a Christmas tree in years because we couldn't afford to spend the money. Today we were randomly browsing Lowe's and saw that they had a deal - all tabletop (3') real trees were only $3. That was already great, but we didn't have any decorations. We stopped by Goodwill, and they had 50% off all Christmas decor. We got a tube of ball ornaments, a big tinsel garland and two bows for the top for $3. All together the whole thing was $6. It may not be a big deal to some people, but we really missed feeling the holiday spirit without a tree. Just wanted to post this in case anyone was in a similar situation and could use the tip.
