NICKY: And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
GINGER: Oh, come on.
NICKY: You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.

NICKY: Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
GINGER: Thanks.
NICKY: Yeah.
GINGER: Thank you.
NICKY: It's all right.
