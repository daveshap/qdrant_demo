STAR MAN: What?
JENNY: Nothing.
JENNY: Good morning.
STAR MAN: Horses.
JENNY: You don't forget anything, do you?
STAR MAN: No.
JENNY: Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
STAR MAN: Do they talk?!
JENNY: No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
STAR MAN: I understand.
JENNY: Oh, you're pretty...
STAR MAN: I gave you a baby last night.
STAR MAN: They are beautiful.
JENNY: Yes, they are.
STAR MAN: You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn. You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
JENNY: But...
STAR MAN: It will be human and it will look like this. But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
JENNY: I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
STAR MAN: You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
