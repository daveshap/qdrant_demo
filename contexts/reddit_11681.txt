I feel so alone.
So I'm the only one in my friend group that is single (I like it for the most part and honestly I'm not really even looking for a relationship right now) but sometimes I want to just disappear and start over.  I feel like except for my parents then no one would miss me.  

A few days a go a friend had a small get together and invited some people over for drinks and finger food.  When I got there I realized that is was 3 couples and me (7th wheel).  I talked to everyone a bit, but it felt like I had just been invited out of politeness since I'm friends with the host and the 2 other guys in the couples that were there.  I was just setting there, sometimes talking to people sometimes not, and I just felt so alone.  I decided to go for a walk so I left the apartment and walked to a nearby park and just sat there looking at things for about an hour and decided to go back to my friend's to say goodbye and leave, and when I got back no one even noticed I was gone.  

I don't really know if I'm looking for advice or what, just getting this off my chest.  I like being by myself sometimes, I'm an introvert, but when things like this happen I just realize how caught up in their own lives my friends are and how little I show up on their radar.
