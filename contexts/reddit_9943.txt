Getting Involved Activity
Hi all,

I'm working on a project where I'm trying to come up with an activity that shows why it's important to get involved in college. I can talk to you until I'm blue in the face about all of the benefits of getting involved, but I've never seen/done an activity about it.

Anything you've seen that you thought has worked well?

Thanks
