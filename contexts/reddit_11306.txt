I can't join the Navy.
This is a bit of a complicated story, so bear with me.  I'm currently a graduate student in nuclear engineering, but as a kid all I wanted to do with my life was attend the Naval Academy and be a fighter pilot in the Navy.  Unfortunately, between the ages of 16 and 18 I discovered three things. Firstly, I don't like flying airplanes.  I don't mine riding in them, just actually piloting them was not the elaborate transcendental life-altering experience I was expecting.  Second, I struggled to meet the academies (very easy-to-meet) physical expectations for entry.  Third, I had childhood asthma, which was another obstacle.  All of these things together led me to decide to pursue a career in physics instead of the Navy.

My desire to join, though, never really went away, it just became dormant.  A few years ago, though, things changed.  First, a conversation with my doctor led me to believe that my asthma was actually misdiagnosed allergies (spoiler warning: this turns out to not be the case).  Second, I started working out, and got in the best shape of my life.  Finally, an offhand comment from my mother made me realize that the Navy would still love to have me, and that there was nothing stopping me from joining if I really wanted to.

So I applied to OCS, and got really excited about the prospect of joining the fleet.  Unfortunately, the asthma was still lurking in my medical records, and ended up medically disqualifying me, which I just found out about today.  I know that's how life goes; sometimes your dreams are beyond your reach no matter how hard you work for them.  It's just really disappointing that I can't serve.  Thanks for listening!
