Stop stringing people along just for sex. If you want casual sex go after someone who wants that’s too.
I’m so tired of(some) guys knowing all they want is casual sex but stringing someone along who they know doesn’t want that because it’s been communicated before. There are plenty of girls out there that are looking for casual sex or fwb go find one of them. It’s really sad to deceive someone by making them think you want something more when you don’t it’s not fair to the person and honestly your wasting both of your time. Please guys that are doing this stop. It’s hurtful and manipulative. I’m not saying all guys do this but a lot do.
