MUMFORD: But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
SKIP: Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
SKIP: -- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
MUMFORD: Everybody has a story, Skip.
SKIP: Sounds like you have several.
MUMFORD: What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy... ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
SKIP: An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
MUMFORD: It wasn't the best situation.
SKIP: Did you carry a gun?
MUMFORD: Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
