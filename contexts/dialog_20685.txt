RACHEL: Thank you. Thank you so much.
LOUIS: Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
JUD: Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
RACHEL: I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
JUD: No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
JUD: Who might you be, little Miss?
ELLIE: I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. At least, I used to.
JUD: And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed.
RACHEL: Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
JUD: Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
LOUIS: No-I guess not.
ELLIE: Yayyy!
