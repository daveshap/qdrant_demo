Not sure what to do my self hate controls my life
I was a very happy kid. I grew up got a little fatter but still was happy. 3-9th grade I felt so bad about myself that I hoped Iâ€™d never date. People always made me feel like shit and it hurt me so bad. Idk. I feel like a disappointment I kinda lost my identity freshman year I started getting anxiety. Iâ€™ve felt depression for a while but it definitely got worse over time. Iâ€™m more scared of life than I am of dying. I feel like at one point of my life my parents switched their kids because I was a lot better as a little kid than I am now. Now Iâ€™m starting to get more responsibilities but I donâ€™t want it. I think life is pointless I want to die. I donâ€™t have confidence Iâ€™ve been going to the gym hoping itâ€™ll help a bit but I want the easy way out. Iâ€™m socially awkward now. Idk but I hate my brain. Iâ€™ve never fit in anywhere. Iâ€™m a loser. Iâ€™m not shit. Iâ€™m not nerdy and def not popular. Iâ€™m in the middle Iâ€™m probably the most average guy at everything. I donâ€™t know what to do in life ðŸ˜•
Edit: shit got so bad I was sent to a psychiatric hospital and havenâ€™t been in school in 2 months I would be a sophomore
