Shout out to all the S.O.'s who accept us
Today was a really bad day for me. For some reason, I could not settle down, even when we went out for a round of golf with the gorgeous weather. I was literally shaking the entire time and was trying to control every aspect of the day.
I did check myself, and relinquished control and eventually calmed down. I mentioned to my better half that I was having "one of those days" and all she said was "I know, I get it, we're cool."
I took her out for dinner and drinks and our evening ended on a very good note.
