I am 21 and I never had a girlfriend before?
So I am 21 male and I never had a kiss or even had a girlfriend before and this kind of bothers me. I am currently living in Las Vegas and go to college on Tuesday and Thursday from 11 am to 6pm. When I am not in class or doing homework I have a lot of free time on my hands. So I joined a few dating sites like OKCupid, POF, Tinder, and a few others. I have been interested in a relationship with another woman but I just do not have the transpiration to do that. I can only go to places wherever my dad goes or if I were to use the Bus. The bus cost like 3$ or more depending on where I want to go.



I have managed to get girls to like me in the past before during school. I never went out with them because at the time I was not allowed to date till I was 16. I have had a couple of girls like me maybe even more because I may have been oblivious to them. In high school during my senior year I noticed that everyone was hooking up with someone and this got me really jealous. Even one of my friends who was really weird managed to get a girl to like him. However, I never have been in a relationship and even now when I got to college I am still single. I have managed to get several replies to me on dating sites like OkCupid and POF. A couple of them are mistresses who are looking for a submissive male and they seem really nice and attractive. I am currently talking to one of them but I am not so sure how the relationship is going. I never had a girlfriend before and this is kind of depressing for me. I would like to get a girlfriend sometimes soon because I fear that I will be forever alone in the relationship department. I have a hard time getting around since I do not have the available transportation. I want a girlfriend but I would like to know what are some tips on getting a girl to like you and go out with you?
