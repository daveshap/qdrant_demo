I want someone to take care of me like they’d take care of a child
I guess this is my survival instinct’s last line of defence. This naive and delusional hope that someone could come and pick up the pieces of me, gently put me back together, literally provide for me and take care of all the adult stuff. Hold me when I cry and relieve me of any responsibilities until I’m actually capable of getting back up on my feet. And that everything will be okay after that. 

I’m 25, but I can’t take care of myself. I know people around me think I can, because this wall I’ve built around myself is tall enough that no one can see the dumpster fire going on inside it. Everything’s falling apart and I’m sitting here just crying. Because I’ve put off asking for help for so long, that the amount of help I would need right now isn’t available. 

Also, it’s like I’m no longer sad because things are shitty, I’m sad because this delusional hope, that’s just survival instinct in disguise, clouds my judgement and catches me between a rock and a hard place. I’m exhausted.
