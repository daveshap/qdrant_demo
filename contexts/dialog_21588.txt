ELIZABETH: Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
ELIZABETH: I'm just stopping by to say hello.
BARRY: Hello.
ELIZABETH: So you're coming tonight, right?
BARRY: Yes, indeed, yes I am.
ELIZABETH: There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
BARRY: Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
ELIZABETH: Why?
BARRY: Well I don't want to do something like that.
ELIZABETH: She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
BARRY: Yeah, but please don't do that.
ELIZABETH: I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
BARRY: Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
ELIZABETH: It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
BARRY: Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
ELIZABETH: That's your fault not mine.
BARRY: I don't think I'm going to the party.
ELIZABETH: So it's ok if I bring her.
BARRY: Please don't.
ELIZABETH: She's really cute and she's really nice.
BARRY: ...please, I just don't want it....
ELIZABETH: ....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
BARRY: Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
ELIZABETH: I'm trying to be your friend.
BARRY: I know.
ELIZABETH: I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
BARRY: Well, yeah, thank you, but --
ELIZABETH: -- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
