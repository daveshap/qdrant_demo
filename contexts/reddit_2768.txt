Why is almost everything I'm interested in and passionate about "oversaturated"?
I'm not going to go into too many details. I'm 26. Everything that has caught my interest I have discarded or given up on due to it being "oversaturated".

Currently really wanting to get into digital marketing, but everyone is saying there's too many and blah blah blah.

Is there a field that is NOT "oversaturated"? Nurses say it. Lawyers say it. Engineers, teachers, even freakin programmers.
