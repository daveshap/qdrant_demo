Notable Student Affair Programs
Currently I'm in my senior year of my undergraduate degree. I'm starting to research graduate school student affairs programs. I don't really know where to begin my search;however, I would like to know what are some either notable or quality student affair programs. Geographically speaking I would prefer to stay in the Northeast or East Coast, but I am not opposed to going elsewhere.
