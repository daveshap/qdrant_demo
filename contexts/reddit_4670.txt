I dont know what to do anymore.
Here i am sitting in my dark room bingwatching how i met your mother, i texted 2 people and only got cold responses.
 I feel like an imposter, like im trying too hard to do something that should come naturally. 
I feel like im the last piece of the puzzle that just happens to have a different picture.  I love my friends, but do they love me back? I dont know. 
I spend so much of my time making sure that everyone has what they need and no one does the same. 
My depression took over my life and people are starting to notice ajd drift from me. 
How long will i be the helpfull one? The one who always has time for others? The one who is always there for every one? How long will i feel this ways? For how long must i continue to live? I dont know, i just know that i am broken.
