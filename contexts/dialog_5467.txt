THEO: Hello? It's just me and you again.
LENORE: What about the others?
THEO: I kind of dropped them off. They were getting on my nerves.
LENORE: What are you doing now?
THEO: What do you think I'm doing? I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
LENORE: Forget about us. Just save Rachel.
THEO: Tell me what she looks like.
LENORE: They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform. Please. Be careful. The man driving the car must have a gun.
THEO: I'm not looking to get myself killed. I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
THEO: Where's the fucking recharger cord? Must be in her car, dammit.
LENORE: How much time do you have left on it?
THEO: I don't know. 80 or 90 minutes, tops.
LENORE: Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
THEO: I don't know. I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
LENORE: A woman?
THEO: Hey drop it, okay?
LENORE: I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
THEO: It never healed. I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her. Click." You don't exist."
LENORE: And that was the end of it?
THEO: I sure as hell got my wish. She doesn't exist. So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
LENORE: I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
THEO: Well you did.
