BILL: - little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
EVE: Are you proud of me, Bill?
BILL: I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
EVE: You shouldn't have had any doubts.
BILL: - after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
EVE: Is that what you want me to be?
BILL: I'm talking about you. And what you want.
EVE: So am I.
BILL: What have I got to do with it?
EVE: Everything.
BILL: The names I've been called. But never Svengali. Good luck.
EVE: Don't run away, Bill.
BILL: From what would I be running?
EVE: You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
BILL: I'm for it.
EVE: Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
BILL: When I told you what every young actress should know.
EVE: When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
BILL: Your make-up's a little heavy.
EVE: - and for you.
BILL: You're quite a girl.
EVE: You think?
BILL: I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
EVE: You hear all kinds of things.
BILL: I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
EVE: Find out.
BILL: Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
