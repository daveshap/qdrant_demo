BLOOM: I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
BIALYSTOCK: Thank you, Leo. And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max. It's only people I really like.
BLOOM: Okay ... Max! And you can call me Leo.
BIALYSTOCK: I already have. Come on.
BLOOM: Oh.
BIALYSTOCK: Where would you like to eat?
BLOOM: Well, Max, I don't know, Max. What do you think, Max?
BIALYSTOCK: Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day. Why waste it indoors. I've got it! Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
BLOOM: Coney Island??
BIALYSTOCK: What's the matter, Leo? Don't you like Coney Island?
BLOOM: I ... I love it. I haven't been there since I was a kid. But it's nearly two o'clock. I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
BIALYSTOCK: Nonsense! As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
BLOOM: Right.
BIALYSTOCK: Then stick with Bialystock!
