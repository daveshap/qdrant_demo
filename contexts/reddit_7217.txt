I made a mistake on my first day of work, and now I feel bad.
I just got hired as an inventory/utility person at a new hospital cafe. I was sweeping the dining area today, and I noticed the area where a woman was eating was a little trashy. I asked her, "Is it okay if I sweep around you?" She said, "Not really because I am eating, but go ahead." I told her, "I'm sorry you're right, it's my first day I'm learning." I thought about it afterwards, and yeah it's rude to sweep and clean around people while they are eating. Only go to tables and areas that are empty and clean them. I felt bad because I made a mistake and the woman was probably a little ticked off. I do not want to make the customers feel unwelcome and unhappy.

I definitely learned my lesson from this, but I still feel bad. What do you guys think?
