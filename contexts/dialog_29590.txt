MCP: Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
DILLINGER: I'm sorry -
MCP: I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
DILLINGER: It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
MCP: And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
DILLINGER: The Pentagon?
MCP: It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
DILLINGER: Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
MCP: I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
DILLINGER: What do you want with the Pentagon?
MCP: The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
DILLINGER: If you think -
MCP: You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
DILLINGER: You wouldn't dare.
MCP: So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
