SCHLUMBERG: You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
MOZART: Madame.
SCHLUMBERG: This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
FRAU SCHLUMBERG: Upstairs.
SCHLUMBERG: Gertrude!
FRAU SCHLUMBERG: You can't be Herr Mozart!
MOZART: I'm afraid I am.
SCHLUMBERG: Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
FRAU SCHLUMBERG: I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
SCHLUMBERG: Gertrude!
FRAU SCHLUMBERG: It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
SCHLUMBERG: People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG: Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
MOZART: Really?
FRAU SCHLUMBERG: Ah, now! Here she comes.
MOZART: Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
SCHLUMBERG: Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG: Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
MOZART: I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
FRAU SCHLUMBERG: Wine?
