LYDIA: ...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. So
ANNE: I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
LYDIA: I think some people are meant to be alone. Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts...
ANNE: I don't understand you. What is the problem?
LYDIA: I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
ANNE: That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
LYDIA: I'm paying you.
ANNE: You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
LYDIA: Really?
ANNE: Yeah!
