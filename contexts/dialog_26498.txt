JONATHAN: Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
MARTHA: All of us.
MARTHA: The good lord works in mysterious ways.
JONATHAN: He sure as heck does that.
MARTHA: All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot... No one must ever know.
JONATHAN: Folks'll ask question.
MARTHA: We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned. Poor thing.
JONATHAN: Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
MARTHA: I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
JONATHAN: Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella. Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
MARTHA: We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
