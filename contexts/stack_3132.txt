Harnessing molecule vibration energy Disclaimer: I am learning physics for fun, please dont kill me but explain where I am wrong.As I understand all molecules have a lowest energy state in which they posses some amount of momentum even in complete vaccum. Can we transfer this minimum momentum into useful energy source?I know that if molecules have energy high enough for chemical reaction to occur then we can harvest that molecules energy with ease.Edit: I imagine vibrating molecule of helium at 0K hitting some part that moves or maybe generates pressure you know some kind of momentum.I mean it has some momentum so it can give it to something else right?I am not sure what tags to add Edit: answered i think but here is a very interesting conversation i found on the topic:www.researchgate.net/post/Is_extraction_of_Zero_point_energy_a_real_phenomenonMaybe big bang is a violation of 2nd law
