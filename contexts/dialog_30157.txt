KEATON: They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
VERBAL: McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
KEATON: What fence? Who?
VERBAL: Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
KEATON: Never heard of him.
VERBAL: You have to come.
KEATON: What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
VERBAL: They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
KEATON: Tough break.
VERBAL: Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
