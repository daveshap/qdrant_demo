VAUGHAN: Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
LINDA: Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
KARL: Yes ma'am, I reckon.
MELINDA: Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
VAUGHAN: Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
LINDA: Vaughan, don't get pushy.
VAUGHAN: I'm sorry.
KARL: I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
MELINDA: I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
