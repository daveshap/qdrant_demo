How do I deduce the Axis of Rotation of objects while solving rolling,angular momentum questions? <blockquote>  A uniform rod of length $L$ lies on a smooth horizontal table. A particle moving on the table strikes the rod perpendicularly at an end and then stops. Find the distance travelled by the centre of the rod by the time it rotates by a right angle.</blockquote>In the above the question,I use $I$ of the rod after the collision as $ML^2/12$ rather than $ML^2/3$ thus clarifying that the rod rotates about its $com$ rather than the end where the collision takes place.Now in another situation,lets say the rod was standing erect on a table and the particle hits the rod at a distance of $L/4$ from the centre of the rod. Now in this case,i am sure the axis used will be at a distance from $com$ rather than $com $ itself. If i am wrong in this question than there are surely many cases in rolling where the objects rotate not at their com but a distance from it with respect to the mass of the particle which striked them and where. In such cases,how do i decide the axis of rotation? Like in the first question itself,why wasnt the axis the end of rod but was its com?
