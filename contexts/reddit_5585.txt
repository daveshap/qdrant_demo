Why don so many “Office Assistant” jobs require Bachelors degrees?
I’m starting to get frustrated in my job search. All these jobs I just KNOW I can do, but they require Bachelors degrees in literally anything just to organize/run an office and answer calls. I just don’t understand.

Edit: this applies to the titles of office assistant, administrative assistant, executive assistant, etc.
