GARCIA: Don't be stupid, George. We've got him. We've got him dead to rights. But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
GEORGE: No thanks, fellas. You've got the wrong fucking guy. I'm not a rat.
GEORGE: Mirtha, what's going on? Everything okay with Kristina?
MIRTHA: Kristina's fine.
GEORGE: Is she here? Is she coming?
MIRTHA: Is she here? George, Kristina hates you. You fucked her over one too many times. And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
GEORGE: Yeah.
MIRTHA: Well, I got a call from Pablo. He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down. His exact words were Fuck Diego.""
GEORGE: He wants me to testify? Is that what he's asking me to do?
MIRTHA: George, he wasn't asking.
GEORGE: Mirtha, how are you doing?
MIRTHA: Better than you.
