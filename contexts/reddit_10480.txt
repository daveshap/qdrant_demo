I don’t want to kill myself, but I still want to die.
I just give up. There’s no light at the end of the tunnel, it won’t get better, I can’t just get through this bit... that’s what people always say, they’ve been telling me things will get better for years. Well they haven’t yet and they never will, because I don’t fucking try to improve my own life, because I don’t care, because I deserve to suffer.

The voices came back strong. I’m starting to agree with them more and more. They’re right, he doesn’t care, no one does. There is no way to get better, no one wants to help, no one will. 

You can’t make it better, so why try. I’m not even good enough to kill myself, I can’t do anything, i just want it to take me. I give up on even trying. I’m just going to walk awayand let it take me.
