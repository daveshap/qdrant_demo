YPbPr, VGA, Basys3 The Basys3\ufeff (a Digilent FPGA) manual says that the VGA analog outputs can drive between 0 and 0.7 volts\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff. Does anyon\ufeffe know if, from a purely analog perspective, this can drive \u201ccomponent video\u201d, or video in YPbPr, by using the outputs normally used for RGB for YPbPr? Obviously I would have to play with the Y to implement \u201csync on Y\u201d\ufeff In the end, I would connect a simple VGA to component cable and connect to a component screen
