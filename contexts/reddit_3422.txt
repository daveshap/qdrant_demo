I thought dating was to get to know *each other*, not just one person asking the other questions.
Trying online dating, and so far the experience has been: 

me: asking them question, 
we have conversation, 
me: ask another question

Please ask me a question! I want to know that you have stuff you're looking for in a person, and not just... match what I need.
