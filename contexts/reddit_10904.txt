I always tell this board I’m going to kill myself...
And I always really mean it when I post it. Then I wake up the next morning and feel okay again. Sometimes it takes a little longer. Maybe by the next afternoon. And then I delete my posts on here.

It’s better to post here than to tell someone I know in my life. Here, I’m just an anonymous weirdo that keeps crying wolf. Barely anyone even comments. 

Years ago I used to tell the people closest to me when I felt like this and it drove them away. It got me sent to a hospital and then stuck with a medical bill I couldn’t afford.

It’s better to just post and delete here. Just another name on this board. I’ll probably never really do it anyhow.
