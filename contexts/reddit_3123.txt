27, associates degree and stuck in a dead-end job. No real passion or direction, but a strong desire to better my life. Where do I even start?
I'm 27, married and have an associates degree from a good community college. For the last few years i've been working as a medical assistant at a family owned place. The pay isn't great, I get no benefits and there's no room for advancement. The work is fine, though it's not something I particularly enjoy or anything.

I need to find a better job; one with better pay and benefits. I want to start improving me and my wife's life, and getting a career seems like the first step. The problem is I have no clear passions or a sense of what direction i'd like to move in. My life-track has kind of been just the default for a while without me really making many decisions. Go to high school -> go to community college till you figure out what you want to do -> get a job until you figure out which bachelors degree you want -> still stuck here.

I'm a pretty hard worker with pretty average intelligence. The closest thing I have to a passion is computers, though i'm not sure i'm cut out for computer science/programming. I don't know what I want to do, and the fact that i'm already 27 without a clear path forward scares me. I'm afraid of wasting even more time and want to work towards something but I can't figure out what, and don't know how to even begin figuring it out. I'm not really sure what kind of advice i'm looking for, but I figured this would be a good place to just reach out for help and guidance.
