A Miracle Harvard Acceptance
***This will take a little while to read. This post is not intended to be cruel, but rather to present a realistic picture of top-tier admissions to prospective undergraduates. To address the holier than thou tone that will undoubtedly be present in this post, I'll preface this by saying that I was rejected from two Ivy League schools (Harvard & UPenn), as well as UMich, Georgetown, and Tufts.*** 


Alright, enough about me. Let's get to you. Based on the demographics of this sub, I'll take a very rough guess that you are a 17 or 18-year-old middle-upper class white male. You have very competitive stats, hold multiple leadership roles in organizations at your school, wrote well thought out essays, and received glowing LORs. Most other kids from your hometown do not compare to you scholastically. In other words? You kicked ass in high school. It's your senior year, and you applied to a number of highly selective undergraduate schools. 

In light of recent ~~rejections~~ events, a growing number of posts have been made on this forum disparaging the inequities present within the college admissions process. Complaints about affirmative action far outnumber critiques of any other system. The implication is that race allows underqualified applicants to gain admission to elite institutions over more deserving, non-minority students. 

This is an extreme oversimplification and shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the admissions process. In an effort to remedy this, I'm taking you on a trip to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

*It's a cold January day here, and flurries are starting to sprinkle. I just finished a slice of cheese at Pinocchio's, a charming pizza place where Mark Zuckerburg used to do CS problem sets. Head outside and turn down Brattle Street, and you end up at the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for Harvard. Inside, your application is currently being considered along with two others for two spots in the incoming Freshman class.*

**Alright, sorry to break the immersion, but I feel the need to say that I understand that this is not close to how admissions decisions are actually made. But I feel that this hypothetical allows the whole picture to become more clear.**

*Where were we? Right. Three applicants. Two spots. Let's meet your peers.*

*Three kids. There's one female, URM. Dirt poor. Slightly lower stats than you. There's you, middle-class male, white. Then there's one ultra-rich white male. Legacy. Lowest stats of the bunch, but only because of a poor freshman year. Everyone has comparable ECs, strong essays, LORs, etc.*

*So (cue opening scene of "The Social Network"); "How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600s on their SATs?"*

*Simple. You need a differentiating factor. In your high school bubble, you were the best. To cut it here? You need to be the best of the best.*


*When those kids walk onto campus for orientation, they will be at one of the most selective institutions in the world. The students around them are all exceptional in different ways. The rich kid has a dad with a $50 million net worth. The URM chick got a perfect SAT score and a 4.0 from a one bedroom house smaller than your kitchen. Look to your left, there's Malia Obama. To your right, Yara Shahidi.*

***This is your competition.***

"Wait. These kids are special cases! What about the normal ones?"

*Harvard offered 1962 people a spot in the incoming freshman class this year. Now, you're right. Malia & Yara are celebrities. They are a special case. Still, let's say two more celebrities applied this year. That's two spots gone. 1960 left. Roughly 30% of the class will be legacy students. That's 589 more spots off the list. 1371 left. 200 more will go to athletes. 1171 left. 10 go to faculty kids, 3 more to members of various royal families, and one to a kid whose last name is on a building. You see what I'm getting at?*

***Everyone is a special case.***

*Year after year, people ask for "Miracle Acceptance Stories" only to be shot down by seemingly wise commenters who simply state "There are no miracle acceptances."* 

*Those commenters are wrong. There are miracle acceptances. Want an example? Miracle acceptances to the most selective colleges in America are people like you. People who have stellar stats, strong extracurriculars, and eloquent essays, but no hook.* 

*You have gone through high school and constantly achieved at a level above and beyond your classmates. But here? In this cold room at 86 Brattle Street? You are something that you haven't been in a long time. Average. No, not an average admit. An average applicant.*

*The two people you're competing against? They played the game. Expertly.*

"But that's not fair! I can't control the situation I was born into!"

*Nobody can! That's the whole point! The athlete gets good genetics, the legacy gets money, and the poor brown kid gets affirmative action! They understood their place. They recognized an imperfect process for what it is; imperfect!* 


*I've never seen someone post "It's unfair that I didn't get into Stanford with a 1230! I'm a bad test taker!" That would be absurd. We all know that high test scores are part of the deal for any top school. Bad at taking tests? Tough luck! Figure it out. Born a middle-class white kid? Know what is required. Adapt, or die. The cards you are dealt are not the end all be all, but knowing how to play them is.*


*The accepted students? They knew their edge from the second they were born. Or they made their own. And they exploited it for everything it was worth.*


***You did not.***






*Dear You,*


*The Committee on Admissions has completed its Regular Decision meetings, and I am very sorry to inform you that we cannot offer you admission to the Class of 2022.* 

*We very much appreciate the interest you have shown in Harvard, and we hope you will accept the best wishes of the Committee for success in all your future endeavors.*
