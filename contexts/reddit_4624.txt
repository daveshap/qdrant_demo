It’s 3:38am on Saturday January 11, 2020 and as I write this, I’ve taken that next step.
OK Long Story Incoming.

I’m someone that never knew that I struggled with depression my whole life as a kid. It was just chalked up to something that was just me being sad. Turns out, far from that fact. As someone that is a Christian, I didn’t know it today/tonight?, but I was given Divine Intervention. I love music and just a song came to mind for me, “I Can Only Imagine”. That song to me just summarized everything I’ve been feeling for as long as I can remember at least 10-15 years of suffering, gone. I’m dedicating my life now to serving everyone afflicted by this and know that you can get help. I know that for a lot of people it’s hard: trust me, I bloody know. The darkness is temporary. The light shines bright. I’m signing myself up for a Gym Membership and going today when I wakeup, I’m going to start doing things that I like that bring value to me. Ok ramble over. Chat with me in the comments please. Love you all even though I just stumbled upon this subreddit today.
