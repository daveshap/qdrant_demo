In this field, how is having degrees from the same state looked upon?
I'm a Colorado native, and I'm very proud of it.  As part of that, I've decided that since I ended up getting my undergrad and master's degrees in this state, I would also pursue my PhD here.  My goal is to attend the University of Denver's Higher Ed program.

I am interested in leaving the state, to work on campuses across the country.  Will the fact that my degrees will have been from the same state count against me?  DU is very highly renowned, and my undergrad and MA universities a little less so, but still accredited public universities.

I really never thought I'd even go to college.  Now I'm on my way to a PhD and I work in higher ed.  Thanks for your help while I try to figure this out.
