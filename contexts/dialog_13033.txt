GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: We are better here.
PAUL: Listen, you need me.
PAUL: You are a marked man.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: How so.
PAUL: The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: I am on a list! What list?
PAUL: When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: You lie.
PAUL: If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: I committed no war crimes.
PAUL: Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: I led no massacres.
PAUL: You think they will believe you?
GENERAL BIZIMUNGU: You will tell them the truth.
PAUL: I will do nothing unless you help me now.
