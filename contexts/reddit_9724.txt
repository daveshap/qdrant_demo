How to become an International Student Advisor
Hi professionals in student affairs, I'm an undergrad student with a major in psychology. After I had graduated from high school I entered the workforce directly and have gained some experiences in office admin and childcare, then I decided to go back to college to pursue an undergraduate degree(so yes, I'm a bit older than kids who go to college right after graduating high school) because I wanted a career change. 

I've realized that I really want to help college students (international students in particular) succeed and give them assistance and guidance in different areas of their academic, personal and professional lives. I was wondering what I should do in order to become an International Student Advisor? Is a post-graduate degree in counseling necessary for said position? How should I build up my experience in advising/counseling? What are some entry-level positions in the International Education or Academic Advising Department? Do academic advisors' responsibilities include career counseling as well? I know that sometimes an academic advisor's duties might overlap with the career counselor's, but what are the key differences between academic advisors and career counselors in terms of required education, skills, abilities and characteristics? 

I hope to hear advices from you, thank you!
