ROSS: Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
KLUTE: No.
ROSS: Examine this letter please. We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
