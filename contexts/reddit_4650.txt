I feel alone , and a burden to everyone.
I have had depression since I was 15 , started treatment at 18. Now I'm 21 and I know my mom's tired . She doesn't know what to do anymore and neither do I.
I feel like I'm a burden. That I'm taking space of someone else. I feel like I should just fucking die and leave everyone alone.
I want to talk to my ex because I want to feel the way he loved me again. But I know he hates me too, or doesn't even think about me anyway.
I want someone to just hug me and let me cry in their arms. But I know I fucked things up and nobody can't stand me now.
I don't fit in. I have no friends , no one I can't talk about this .
