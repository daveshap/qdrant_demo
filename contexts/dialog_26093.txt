FILMORE: I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
FILMORE: He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
COOPER: You should listen your old man more often. He's got principles.

COOPER: After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me. He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
FILMORE: What's that supposed to mean?
COOPER: What do you think?
FILMORE: Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
COOPER: No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat. Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
