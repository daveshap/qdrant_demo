PSA; When There Are Free Items Being Given Away Only Take What You Need!
Ok, I have to vent and this seemed like a good place to do so. I recently attended an event at a church where they were giving away new and used coats, boots, and other warm winter gear. Everything was donated. I have actually donated to this program several years in a row when I was doing well. I got there early and while waiting in line I overheard a couple talking. The girl was going over what brands to look for because the local used clothing store only buys certain brands. Once inside, I noticed there were 5 brand new winter coats. The couple each took one along with some others they had found. I tried on a medium one and it didn’t fit so I put it back. Immediately the girl came and took it. By this time she had her arms full and so did her boyfriend. I asked her if she found a large coat and she said yes but needed it for her large family. I ended up leaving with nothing as did many others. Those two pretty much cleared the place out. They left with 2 garbage bags and headed straight for the store where you sell clothes. I wasn’t following them, I had to catch a bus across from the store. I just cannot believe how selfish and greedy some people can be. They let people freeze so that they could get money. Who knows what they needed the money for, but with the way things are around here, I would guess drugs. I really feel sorry for the people who waited out in the cold with me only to leave without a coat. With the amount that couple took, we all could have had warm winter coats. The moral of the story; only take what you need. Other people are in need too,
