TROI: Captain, Im sorry. I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
PICARD: What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
TROI: It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies. But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
PICARD: In a way, he was as close as I ever came to having a child of my own.
TROI: Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
PICARD: Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
TROI: You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
PICARD: My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
TROI: There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
