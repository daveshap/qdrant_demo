BEN: I don't see why. I don't believe we've ever met.
LUKE: I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
BEN: I know who you are. Stand up so that we can talk properly. You're embarrassing me. I'm not that important.
LUKE: But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart. My father...
LUKE: I... I'm not a Bendu Officer. I'm not even a startrooper.
BEN: I know that.
LUKE: You saw through me?
BEN: You could put it that way.
LUKE: I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
BEN: I know your intentions. I probably know much more about you than you realize. In many ways you're a lot like your father. He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior. Now what brings you out here?
LUKE: My father told me many stories about you. He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
