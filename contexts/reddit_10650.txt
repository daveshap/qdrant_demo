Why suicide is so damn hard?
I never understood why people call it "the easy way out" it's definitely not easy at all. I keep having suicidal thoughts and plans everyday and i only acted on them once and i never did it again because it's too hard and there is a lot of risks 
No one wants others to be traumatised because of him and no one wants himself to live in a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

My suicidal thoughts are worse than ever and i can't deal with it anymore. I just want the pain to stop
