I'm contracted to work for a government agency but my paycheck is signed by the contracting company, not the government agency. Who should I say I work for when I update my job on LinkedIn and similar sites.
I work for NOAA and go to work at the NOAA facility every day, and my bosses are all NOAA employees. But I'm a contracted employee and this other company signs my paychecks. I'd like to just put that I work for NOAA on my LinkedIn because the name holds some weight and is more impressive than this other company which isn't very well-known.

I could put both agencies, but then it won't link to the NOAA page or to the other agency's page. There's no option to correctly set up two different companies for one position, and I kind of like having the NOAA picture next to my current position on LinkedIn. Is it bad to just put that I work for NOAA if I mention that I'm a contracted employee in the job description?
