I GOT ACCEPTED INTO MY #1 CHOICE SCHOOL!
I know that for most people on this sub my #1 choice (Western Washington University) would be a safety, but I was genuinely scared I wasn’t gonna get in, and I’m so glad I did! 

Edit: Thank you all for your kind comments! And to those of you who also got into Western, hopefully I’ll see you there!
