I really don't like gym class
Gym class you know you have those units based on certain sports and every time I get in these units where you can pick your partner or group nobody picks me but people talk to me and all out of gym class normally and in gym class so why does no one say"Hey want to be my partner" I can't take much more of it because it brings me to actually tears thinking no one cares I told my mom about it and she said I'm a nice young man and I still have my family I felt happy about that but still in the end no one will willingly go with me.
