Stop leading your partner on after you lose feelings for them
I feel like this is mostly a young person thing (I’m a 20M btw), and I see it most commonly in girls. They don’t want to hurt someone else’s feelings especially someone they may have dated for awhile, so if they start to loose feelings for the person they’re dating they just continue to go along with it half-heartedly, even though the other person might still be very invested and at that point just leading them on. It just creates a lot more issues later down the road when said persons lack of trying in the relationship actually starts to really hurt the other person and might ultimately lead to them cheating on the other person if they keep putting off a breakup because they’re afraid of rejecting or saying no to someone.
