MISS GALLAGHER: Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
DAVID: What time is it?
MISS GALLAGHER: It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
DAVID: Alex?
MISS GALLAGHER: Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
DAVID: What are you going to see?
MISS GALLAGHER: An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
DAVID: Do you have bad dreams, too?
MISS GALLAGHER: Some, everyone does.
DAVID: Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
MISS GALLAGHER: Bambi?
