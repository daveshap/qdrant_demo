BREN: Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
ULTRASOUND TECH: I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
JUNO: How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
LEAH: Or stage parents!
BREN: They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
ULTRASOUND TECH: No... I guess not.
BREN: What is your job title, exactly?
ULTRASOUND TECH: Excuse me?
BREN: I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
ULTRASOUND TECH: I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
BREN: Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
ULTRASOUND TECH: What are you talking about?
BREN: You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
