COLE: The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
HEBBING: One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
COLE: You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
HEBBING: Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
COLE: Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
HEBBING: Not much time.
COLE: We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
HEBBING: Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
COLE: These machines -- They're in here.
COLE: Want a look?
MYRA: Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
COLE: Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
MYRA: We're not really interested, Henry.
