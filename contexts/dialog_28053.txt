SAM: The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
MICHAEL: I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
SAM: Wanna go to the comic book store?
MICHAEL: No.
ALAN: How do you like Santa Carla?
SAM: It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
EDGAR: Or a vampire.
SAM: Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
EDGAR: You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you? Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
ALAN: Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
SAM: This isn't a comic book store, right. It's a bakery.
EDGAR: This is just our cover. We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
SAM: Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
ALAN: We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
SAM: You better get some fresh air.
