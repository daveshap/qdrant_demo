Is this a scam, I don't remember applying
I received this email this morning but I don't remember applying to this company. I can't be too sure as I applied to many positions in the last month. I tried searching for the names listed in the email but I can't find them in LinkedIn which seems pretty shady to me. Has anyone have experience with this company?
