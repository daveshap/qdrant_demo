I doubt myself too much.
Hi.

I'm not sure if anyone else has ever felt this feeling but I suppose it has to do something with my low self esteem. For some reason I can't help but feel insecure about my relationships with my friends. I find myself doubting why people want to associate with me. Probably because I've been alone for such a long time, growing up, that I'm not used to this or perhaps it's because I don't understand, but..

I doubt myself at every turn. I don't want to. I want to believe that people want to hang out with me, but there's that voice in the back of my head that keeps going "Why?". I don't think I'm fun, in fact I think I'm rather cringey. I think I'm annoying.

I don't know, it's depressing me lately and I'd love to just believe but for some reason I can't.

It's tearing me up inside. Worse off, at the end of the day I feel like I'm not even needed.

I'm really not. I'm just a placeholder until people get bored. I fail to be interesting or show any knowledge of anything other than video games. I have a hard time picking up on things and am very slow mentally entirely. It's hard to not think that people are just being with me out of pity.

It hurts.
