I introduced my best friend to my crush and now they’re dating
Like WHAT THE HELL! 

I’ve liked her for years but it takes only one week for him to like her too and one month for them to start dating.

Edit: btw I respect their relationship and I’m still close friends with them both. It’s my fault I didn’t make a move when I had a chance and they’re actually quite cute together.
