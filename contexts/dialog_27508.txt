BRAND: You write that? Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
DANNY: I have a job.
BRAND: This? This is a joke. I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
DANNY: You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
BRAND: Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
DANNY: Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
BRAND: Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
BRAND: Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore. There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
DANNY: People still need values, beliefs....
BRAND: No, they don't. Not the smart ones. Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
DANNY: I don't care about money.
BRAND: You will.
DANNY: You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
BRAND: Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
