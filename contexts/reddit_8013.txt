College ring in grad school
So I got an email that I qualify for getting a LSU ring because I have completed 18 credits thus far as a grad student. Iâ€™m going to get my PhD in the same place, but it feels, sketchy, you know? Like I have a college ring from my undergrad because I was a double major and overcame a lot of personal traumatic issues. This feels like a cash grab.

However I would like to commemorate in some way that is less gaudy.

Thoughts? Advice
