Not sure why people always put a group picture as their main dating app picture.
This happens so often. They would have a picture of them next to their friend. I always hate it when I see one where I’m like “oh that person is cute! I hope it’s that person” and then it turns out to be the least attractive person in the picture in my opinion.
