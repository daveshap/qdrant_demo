Getting interviews in my field with open to relocation, but am currently homeless.
Hello, I recently graduated with a CS degree and I relied on dorms for housing. I currently have two part time jobs but am actively getting interviews / on-sites for jobs that are all at pretty varying distances in different directions. 

I am afraid to sign for a lease and then get hired somewhere that's 3+ hours away especially with so little cash to start with. I currently live out my car but I'm not sure if I can legally do this / keep it up, especially in winter.

It's just a weird situation to be in. I don't know if I'll get hired soon or where but I'm trying to keep my options open and I could use some advice with this situation.
