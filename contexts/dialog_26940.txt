NICHOLAS: You promised you'd meet projections, Alan. A dollar sixty per share you said. So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
ALAN BAER: Projections were far too optimistic.
NICHOLAS: Admittedly...
ALAN BAER: Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter. We're up eight cents per share.
NICHOLAS: But, the expectation was ten. And, in this case, expectation is everything.
ALAN BAER: Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
NICHOLAS: My stock's falling. Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
ALAN BAER: The stock will turn.
NICHOLAS: It probably will. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time. Why should I settle for that?
ALAN BAER: Because it's fair. Give me next quarter. If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
NICHOLAS: You're talking tomorrow. Today is what counts.
ALAN BAER: You intractable son-of-a-bitch. If your father could see you now...
NICHOLAS: What?
ALAN BAER: Your father was a friend. Goddamn it... I watched you grow up. How do you end up treating me like this?
NICHOLAS: It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father. Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship? Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
ALAN BAER: Now, look...
NICHOLAS: I'll be done in a minute. You misspoke before. You're not stepping down." I'm taking you out at the knees. The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore. I'm firing you. Action's taken. Confidence restored. Stock goes up. I sell my shares."
ALAN BAER: There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
NICHOLAS: Remember Daniel Grant? Do they say, without Daniel Grant
