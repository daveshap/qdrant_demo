CRAIG: We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
DOYLE: We ran the i.d. I could have told you that.
CRAIG: I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
DOYLE: Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
CRAIG: Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
DOYLE: If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
CRAIG: That's the point. He slipped up, and he's desperate now. And that means he's all the more dangerous.
CRAIG: I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
DOYLE: Cooperate?
CRAIG: Every step of the way.
DOYLE: If you guys want in, fine. Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
