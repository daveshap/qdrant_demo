People accused me of stealing stuff
Okay well I've graduated high school for a couple of months now and this has kinda bothered me for a while. When I was in high school my friend's phone got stolen and I was accused of stealing it.well obviously I've stopped associating with them but I'm still kinda pissed. I don't know whether I should get revenge or confront them or just let shit go. I'm gonna go to college in a month or two btw.
