I graduated college, I’m in a job with no growth opportunities, now what?
I (23F) graduated college with a BS in Health Science because I failed Nursing, I ended up not liking the clinical aspect anyways so I don’t wanna try it again. I got a job right out of college because in my last semester I had to intern in a hospital and they offered me a job. I’m working in the volunteer office in the hospital I interned at. I hate it, I’m over worked and under paid but I know I’m just using this for experience. Now I don’t know what to do with my life. I’m willing to go back and get a masters if anything but I am stuck. I’m open to anything, I just need some guidance. Any advice?
