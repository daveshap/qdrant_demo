ALICE: I don't drink coffee.
KORSHUNOV: You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
ALICE: No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
ROSE: Leave my daughter alone.
KORSHUNOV: Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall? But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
ROSE: What do you know of my husband?
KORSHUNOV: I know he left you behind.
ROSE: My husband is a very courageous man.
KORSHUNOV: Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
ALICE: You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
KORSHUNOV: So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
ALICE: Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
KORSHUNOV: Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
ALICE: Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
