BILL: Why?
EVE: I just wondered.
BILL: Just wondered what?
EVE: Why.
BILL: Why what?
EVE: Why you have to go out there.
BILL: I don't have to. I want to.
EVE: Is it the money?
BILL: Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
EVE: Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
BILL: The Theatuh, the Theatuh- - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna? Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
EVE: I just asked a simple question.
BILL: And I shot my mouth off. Nothing personal, junior, no offense... ... it's just that there's so much bushwah in this Ivory Green Room they call the Theatuh - sometimes it gets up around my chin...
EVE: But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
BILL: It's only one picture deal.
EVE: So few come back...
BILL: Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
EVE: I read George Jean Nathan every week.
BILL: Also Addison deWitt.
EVE: Every day.
BILL: You didn't have to tell me.
