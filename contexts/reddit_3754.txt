Online dating is dehumanizing
I hate that you can virtually bond with someone over the couple of a few texts and before you even get the chance to ask them out, they’ll ghost you into oblivion and stop responding completely.
I get that everyone is free to do as they please but I’ve been rejected at least three times this past week just by girls who stopped replying and let the conversation die, even if it was well.
Im a girl by the way. It just sucks. I’m hopeless and I feel like I’ll never be able to meet anyone for real. 
Im gay so it makes it twice as hard for me to find someone to date and online dating is a good way to meet women but if they didn’t ghost after three messages that would be better
