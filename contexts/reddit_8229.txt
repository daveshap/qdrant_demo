What actually happens if the USPS gets privatized?
The USPS recent warned congress that [it could become insolvent amid coronavirus](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/10/politics/postal-service-congress-help/index.html). There have been reports that the government has been slow moving on this, specifically as it relates to [mail-in voting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/republicans-vote-by-mail.html). Donald trump now [reportedly said he would reject a bailout package if it included aid to keep the US Postal Service functioning](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-rejects-bailout-that-included-aid-to-usps-report-says-2020-4). This has got people talking about [the possibility of the US Postal Service being privatized](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trumps-privatization-plan-would-destroy-the-postal-service/2018/08/07/caaf9a24-99a2-11e8-8d5e-c6c594024954_story.html).

1) How does the privatization actually work and what are the benefits and downsides of privatizing the USPS?   
2) How would it affect the USPS itself?  
3) How would it affect ordinary people like myself?  
  
  
I'm asking because I'm trying to understand the mechanics and scope of this thing.
