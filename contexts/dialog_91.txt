SANCHEZ: The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
AROJAZ: The Judgment is ours!
SANCHEZ: Naturally. But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
AROJAZ: He is a mercenary! Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
SANCHEZ: Indeed. The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them. My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
