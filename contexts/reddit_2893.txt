Left banking job on bad terms after 6 years and have done nothing for over a year - how to approach CV, recruiters, etc?
Hi,

&#x200B;

I worked in investment banking for 6 years straight out of college. This was a stressful, front office, client facing role. I was in the top performing quartile of peers each year, and my immediate bosses had a high opinion of me (not trying to toot my own horn, just hope this might mitigate some of what follows). The 1st section below describes what happened, and the 2nd section gives more personal details (not shared with my former employer). My questions are:

1. Given my situation, do I need to list anything specific on my CV (obviously other than my employment ending on so-and-so date 15 months ago)? I'm thinking of 2 things: do I need to describe how my employment ended? Do I need to explain the \~15 month gap in my employment history?
2. When (if...) I speak to recruiters / at job interviews, what should I say about how my previous job ended? I can explain what happened (kind of like I do below in the "external perspective"), but I assume when they call my previous employer as a reference they will be told I was fired on bad terms?
3. How do I explain the long gap since my previous job to recruiters? I obviously can't give the "personal perspective" below. I was thinking of simply saying "personal/family issues I had to deal with"

The story (from an **external perspective**) goes like this: 

The job (and especially one person in the team) was very toxic, I was literally the only junior who managed to stay in that team for more than a year or two (those before me either quit or were fired). Around a year before we "parted ways" (more on this below), the stress and toxicity had really gotten to me, and despite the very high pay, I had decided to resign. I tried to resign twice but unfortunately since I was a little bitch, my boss managed to talk me into staying. Ultimately he convinced me to take a sabbatical for a few months and said if I still wanted to leave after that, I was welcome to. 

I took him up on the offer but when I subsequently met with HR in the coming days/weeks, it turned out my boss had told them I needed to take stress related sick leave. There's obviously a big difference between that and a sabbatical - HR made me see a doctor, demanded updates every week, etc. Basically after a few months of this, I went MIA (not answering phone/emails) and a few months after that, the company terminated me.

The story (from a **personal perspective** \- my employer didn't know any of this): 

\~2 years before I left I started using drugs quite heavily, partly due to the very demanding job, partly due to the toxic co-worker, and partly due to my addictive personality (can't blame everything on the job alone!). No one knew (knows) about the drugs and they never affected my ability to do the job (in fact I achieved my highest rankings vs. peers in those last 2 years). As soon as my "leave" started, the drug use spiralled completely out of control, which contributed to depression, which made drug use worse, etc. (vicious cycle). A few months in, I stopped caring about everything, never left my house, stopped talking to family/friends/work. All I did was do drugs and play video games. Some of my family/friends literally thought I had died! This continued until \~8 months ago, when I ran out of money/savings and had to move back in with my parents. On the bright side, hitting rock bottom finally made me get clean - I've been off drugs (but still battling with depression) for around 6 months now. I've finally found the motivation to get a damn job so today is literally the first time I've logged into LinkedIn in years!
