Went on one date and am already head over heels for this guy. Is that crazy?
I feel crazy because I usually take things really slow when I start to date, but I’m so into this guy it’s nuts! We’ve been talking on the phone and texting nonstop. We went on one date and it was incredible! I’ve never been so nervous that I’m going to fuck something up before. He’s so sweet and happy and lovely and beautiful. I think he likes me too! God, it feels crazy and like my feelings are developing really quick. I feel like I need to slow down and relax almost! Man, keep your fingers crossed for me guys!! I’m excited to see where this goes :-)

EDIT: Sounds like a lot of you have been burned. I’ll err on the side of caution and try to slow down, but I’m not turning down my excitement. Thank you for all the input, and thank you to all those who shared my positivity!
