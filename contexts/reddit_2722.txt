Am I wasting my potential working as a mechanic?
I was identified as a gifted kid. I am highly literate, and earned a bachelor of arts. . . 

and then fell out of the white collar world entirely. I dislike desk jobs. I have farmed, and worked in construction, and now finally at age 39 got a job that pays a decent wage as a maintenance mechanic.

The job is really interesting and I like it. But I am the only mechanic at the plant who can also draft a comprehensible email. Or read a book. 

I am an OK mechanic. But I can't escape this feeling like I should be aiming higher or doing something \*more\*. 

I dunno. I am overjoyed to finally have benefits and a pension, which is more than a lot of people can ask for, but I just have this nagging feeling like my imagination is bigger!

Thanks for reading.
