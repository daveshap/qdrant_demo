"No matter how attractive a person's potential may be
...you have to date their reality."

I just read that and it hit home. Thought I'd share it.

I just recently dated someone who simply wasn't ready to get involved with *anyone* because of a recent breakup. 

I had (or if I'm honest still have to some degree) a hard time dealing with the fact that timing just wasn't in our favor because we really clicked and I was so sad over the fact that it just wasn't meant to be.

But the thing is... Sometimes things just can't work out.

No matter how good you two would be together, how much you click, how much chemistry you have with each other, how attracted you are to each other, how well you fit together...

Sometimes it's just not meant to be because your realities just don't match up. For reasons unknown.

It's nobody's fault really. It's not that you're not good enough. It's not that you did or say something wrong. Sometimes timings a bitch. Sometimes the other person isn't in the right emotional state. Sometimes their circumstances get in the way. Whatever.

And in that moment your self respect has to be stronger than your feelings.

Don't beg. Don't discuss it. Don't force yourself back into their lives. Don't argue.

They probably made a healthy decision for themselves. Even if you can't wrap your head around it. Most of the time it's probably not an easy decision for them either. But it's probably a healthy one for you too. Whether you know it or not, you probably wouldn't want to be involved with them while whatevers going on, that prevents you from being with them, is going on, anyway.

So let them go.

Maybe you'll find each other again under the right circumstances - but don't count on it. Let them go completely and just live your life. Close this chapter and open a new one.
