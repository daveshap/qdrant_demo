Where are all the underground bunkers? In Player Unknown battlegrounds there's a massive underground bunker in F4 filled with high grade loot. I know from a game where I joined a random squad that there are more underground bunkers as we ran across a small one as we were traversing the map. I have not been able to find the smaller bunker again; how many underground bunkers are there and where are they located?
