JIM: Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
ELENA: Let me.
JIM: Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
ELENA: You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
JIM: Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
JIM: You want coffee or something?
ELENA: Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
JIM: Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
ELENA: My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
ELENA: Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
JIM: What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
ELENA: Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
JIM: Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
