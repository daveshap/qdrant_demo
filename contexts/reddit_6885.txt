Need Advice emailing the CEO!
Hello all, the description says it all but here are a few details:

So I was an intern for a big bank for a year and I was gonna return as FTE upon my graduation this summer.

But it happens that the CEO announced layoffs and cost-cutting strategies which ultimately lead to the hiring freeze within the institution. Now after knowing that I went to my manager to talk more about this and as a conclusion, it turns out that he couldn't do much and cannot certainly hire me back due to the hiring restrictions throughout.

I invested my time there expecting to return upon my graduation but now I can't just because of cost-cutting strategies. I have to look elsewhere finding a job and not going back to where I loved to work/ belonged to.

Now, I was thinking to email the CEO stating my situation about this matter and see if anything can be done. Is this a good idea to take this concern up to the CEO? If yes, what details should I include in the email? I read some articles on how to email the CEO, the first-line, subject line, and other things but your inputs would be valuable and helpful.

Thanks!
