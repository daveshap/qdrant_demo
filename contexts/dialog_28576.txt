KALEN: What else can they do?
ALEXANDER: Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?

KALEN: The Hall of Books.
ALEXANDER: You have books?! Kalen, you've got to take me there. There might be history. Records. Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
KALEN: I shouldn't have mentioned it. We can't go there.
