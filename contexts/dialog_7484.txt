MCCLANE: Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago. He said I could bunk with him.
HOLLY: Oh...Where does he live?
MCCLANE: Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
HOLLY: Pomona! You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy. I have a spare bedroom. It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
MCCLANE: They would, huh?
HOLLY: I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
HOLLY: ...I've missed you.						*
MCCLANE: Especially my name. You must miss it every time you write a check. When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
HOLLY: This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
MCCLANE: Sure. It's unnerving. I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
HOLLY: Didn't we have this same conversation in July? Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
MCCLANE: No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
HOLLY: My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
MCCLANE: Oh, here it comes. One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
HOLLY: You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad. I needed that, John. I deserved that.
