Do you ever have nights where you just accept you’re not gonna sleep, I guess?
It’s 4am. I’ve been trying to sleep since midnight but I don’t really feel tired. This is the first time this has happened to me (also probably partially due to the fact that this is the first night in a while I decided to stay sober).
