Told my[f26] fwb[m27] about my feelings
So I’ve been seeing this guy pretty regularly for the past 3, almost 4 months. We have been hooking up and drinking together about once a week. This started right after I broke up with my ex so I thought of this guy as kind of a rebound...

I’ve started to get feelings for him. He’s never been in a serious relationship at all and never seemed like he wanted to. Which seemed fine with me until a couple weeks ago. He said he’s been thinking more about getting into a relationship with someone because his friends and family think it would be good for him. Last week he started talking to me about having kids together later on in life... asked me to stay over so we could cuddle.. was generally being pretty “coupley” with me. 

I realized after I left his place that I didn’t want him to be with anyone else... so tonight I decided to say something. It didn’t go the way I wanted, he said his crush he had on me previously was gone, and that he has never been a serious relationship kinda guy and probably never will be. I tried to say I wasn’t trying to be serious, I just wanted a little something more. And to take some time to think about this and he said he is pretty much decided 

I am pretty hurt by this obviously, but what I came here to say is, don’t ever be afraid to say whatever it is that you are afraid to say. Now I don’t have to wonder what “could have been” with this guy. I’m actually really proud of myself for being brave enough to say how I feel. I would have never done this in the past! 

Life is too short to hold back how you feel. Always always tell them.
