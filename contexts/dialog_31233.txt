MADMARTIGAN: Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
RAZIEL: He's no magician.
MADMARTIGAN: He turned that monster into stone!
RAZIEL: Did *you* give that acorn its power?
WILLOW: No.
RAZIEL: A magician *makes* magic. Any fool can use it.
MADMARTIGAN: Then you get us out of here.
RAZIEL: I will! But I need help!
WILLOW: I'll help you...!
MADMARTIGAN: I won't.
RAZIEL: You must learn magic.
WILLOW: That's all I ever wanted!
RAZIEL: Then I will teach you.
