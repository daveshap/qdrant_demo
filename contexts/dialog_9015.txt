CASH: So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
JACK: I don't do that. That's just not for me...
CASH: Okay, Jack. Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
JACK: Hey...
JACK: What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
CASH: You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
JACK: I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy. At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
CASH: Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
JACK: I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
CASH: Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
CASH: Oh man, you're serious... This man thinks I need to be saved!
JACK: Everyone needs something.
CASH: Yeah? What do you need?
JACK: Me?
CASH: You just said everyone needs something.
JACK: I've got everything I need.
CASH: Wow. It must be great being you. You got it all.
JACK: Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
CASH: You still think this is about me, don't you?
JACK: Sure it's about you. But it's about society, too.
CASH: Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this. You brought this on yourself...
