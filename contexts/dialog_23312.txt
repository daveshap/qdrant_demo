MOM: Who wants fruit salad?
MISTY: I do, please.
MOM: That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
MISTY: It's sugarless.
MOM: You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing...
MISTY: Sorry, Mom. Thanks. Hey, Chip, think I could get 50c for Vanilla Ice.
CHIP: I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
MISTY: Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
MOM: And who may I ask is Carl?
MISTY: Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
CHIP: Here we go again.
MISTY: He's really cute!
MOM: Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
CHIP: She sure can pick 'em!
MISTY: He goes to college with me!
DAD: Leave her alone, Chip. I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
