Girl is awesome, looks nothing like her photos M26 F30's
Met a girl yesterday after talking for over a week. We both have the same sense of humor and everything flows so well. So, I meet her yesterday and I am not attracted at all physically. I tried to be, but I just don't have it. Not only did she look different in her photos, but she wasn't as attractive and she was way heavier, which I am not against someone heavier, but this was too heavy for me. I feel like an asshole because we connected so well, but I had to force everything in person because I just was not into it. I think she really likes me and I feel bad.

TL;DR-Girl and me talked for over a week. Met and she doesn't look like her photos.

Update: It isn't just about weight in the photos. She looks completely different in person. I don't know if it is the snapchat filters or the editing, but it is kind of mind blowing. Like, I don't mind heavier at all. I will be with a girl even if shes heavier, but it is just weird to me of how different she looks from what I expected. She even said after dinner,"Do I look anything like my photos?" I told her yes when I should have been honest. I was just trying to get out of there without making a scene.
