ETHAN: May I come in?
CLAIRE: Sure...
ETHAN: It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
CLAIRE: You don't think we're going to make it.
ETHAN: I didn't say that.
CLAIRE: You didn't have to.........
ETHAN: I just need you to be safe.
CLAIRE: What about you?
ETHAN: What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply. I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
