I found out my dead grandfather murdered my nan when my mum was young
Me, my brother, and my mother were eating dinner last year at a restaurant. We were having jokes and having a good time. Eventually the conversation goes steers toward my dead grandfather. It's here mum starts getting emotional saying us two are the only family she has now (one uncle is in prison, the other she doesn't talk to because of pretty horrid quarrels which I won't be going into). It's here my brother asks her what happened to nan (All I knew about her was that she was dead and that granddad remarried) 


It's here she spills the beans. She starts tearing up and explains when she was little she heard her father beat her mother to death. 


The meal was awkward after that. She wouldn't elaborate the rest of the holiday. I had to ask my dad to elaborate and he only knew what mum told him: not much. But he confirmed it: my grandfather was a murderer. 


I don't know how the bastard got away with it. He was in the army. This would have been around the sixties/seventies I'd imagine. 


I hate that man. I wish there was a heaven just so I'd know he's rotting in hell. This evil abusive piece of shit used to tell me bed time stories. Part of me wishes he was still alive so I could kick his ass. He stole my nan from me and my brother and a mother from my mother.  I hate him so much and yet he died before I had the chance to confront him. I can't even deface a grave as its so far away. I went to this things funeral and little did I know I was paying respects to a monster. 



How can I come to terms with it? How do I move on? What would make me feel better?
