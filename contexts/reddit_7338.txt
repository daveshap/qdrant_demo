Hired at two jobs, may have to reject one
I went job hunting all last week for a hostess, got hired at two and start training today and tomorrow at both jobs. problem is they both run the same hours and days so i may not be able to work at both. Ive never been a hostess and would not mind working at both if possible. Any advice will do:)
