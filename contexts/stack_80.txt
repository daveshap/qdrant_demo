iPhone keeps losing signal right after picking up a call We have an old iPhone 5 at work that is used as a general incoming-calls phone. It\u2019s used for very little other than just making and receiving calls.In general, its reception has always been good and stable, with no unexpected problems.Lately, however, an issue has started repeating with annoying frequency: when we receive a call and pick up the phone, the conversation goes smoothly for about 20\u201330 seconds or so, then you hear three short, rapid bleeps (\u2018doot-doot-doot\u2019), and the connection is dropped. A few seconds later, the signal strength indicator at the top of the screen says \u201cNo signal\u201d for about 10\u201320 seconds. Then full signal comes back and you can continue to make calls as usual.I haven\u2019t experienced this issue when calling out\u2014only when receiving calls. When calls are not being made, signal strength also seems to be normal (at least I haven\u2019t noticed it cutting out at other times).The actual signal strength is excellent, so it\u2019s not because of dodgy coverage. We have about ten other phones, both iPhones and Androids, that manage just fine, and this is a recent issue with this one phone as well. Wifi signal/connection is not lost.I\u2019ve tried Googling for a solution to this issue, but all I\u2019m able to find are countless reports of either people who can\u2019t receive calls at all on their phones (which we can), or people whose phones just generally have bad reception/signal (which ours doesn\u2019t).I\u2019ve tried toggling basically all the reception/signal/connection-related settings I could find, and the phone has been restarted and switched off/on several times, with no effect.Is this a known issue that my weak Google-fu is just unable to unearth? And more importantly, is there a solution for it?
