New job!?
Hello everyone! I have officially gotten my first office job at a call center. I am extremely stoked because this is actually my first office job, however that’s what I need help with.

I turned 18 a couple months ago, and I’ve been working at this high school every level job at a movie theater. So with this new job, it’s a totally new experience for me. However are there any tips you guys can give me for starting this new office job? Expectation? Dress code, etc. anything helps!
