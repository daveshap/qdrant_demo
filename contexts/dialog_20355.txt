FOLEY: Where in the hell are we?
BUDDY: That's the turnpike up there. Glenn's waiting with the other car.
FOLEY: Okay, honey, come on out of there.
KAREN: Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
FOLEY: Shit...
BUDDY: We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
FOLEY: She's coming with us.
BUDDY: Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
FOLEY: Get the shotgun. And her purse. I'd like to know who she is.
