KAY: What will your father say?
MICHAEL: As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object. He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
KAY: What time do they expect us?
MICHAEL: For dinner. Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
KAY: Michael.
MICHAEL: Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
