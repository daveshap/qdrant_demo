TLS protocol, session key for secure connection In Wikipedia, as part of handshaking between a client and a server, the server send a public encryption key as part of the digital certificate.Then the client uses Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange to securely generate a random and unique session key for encryption and decryption.Questions:is the public key sent by server encrypted or clear? I assume it is clear since it is publicHow are the session key and public key related? Does the client sends session key to the server?session key sent: f(Random_gen_number, Public_key) where f is an encryption function?
