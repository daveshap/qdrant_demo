CASEY: Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
MAN: Or else what?
CASEY: My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
MAN: I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
CASEY: I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
MAN: Sure...
CASEY: I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.
MAN: I'm getting scared.
CASEY: I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
MAN: I believe you...
CASEY: So you better leave.
MAN: His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
CASEY: How do you know his name?
MAN: Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
