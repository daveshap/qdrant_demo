I feel like I’m being rabbitholed into a role with no signs of opportunity.
Nuff said. I’ve worked here for a few years and I feel like my performance is good. I’ve received positive feedback from my supervisor, multiple people look towards me for more info, and I’m training higher level personnel.

But that’s where I’ve stayed these past few years and people who started way after me are doing higher level work that I’ve asked about for much longer. In fact, I haven’t trained on anything compared to...pretty much everyone. Lately there’s been a lot of changes in the company and I don’t want to get left behind. This is my first career job and I need as much experience from this position so I can move forward in my career.

Any help is appreciated, thank you!
