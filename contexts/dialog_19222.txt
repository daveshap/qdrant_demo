DUFF: Is that so?
JOSIE: Yeah, that's so.
JOSIE: What's wrong?
DUFF: Smells like something crawled in there and died.
JOSIE: Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
DUFF: Come here, baby.
DUFF: Everything you cook is good.
JOSIE: Duff - you know those women you used to know--
DUFF: What about them?
JOSIE: Am I as good as they?
DUFF: Hmmm - good coffee.
JOSIE: You didn't answer my question.
DUFF: Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
JOSIE: You still didn't answer my question.
DUFF: Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
JOSIE: You know how to box?
DUFF: Uh-huh. Why?
JOSIE: My kids want me to teach them.
DUFF: Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
DUFF: Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
JOSIE: I don't want to hurt you.
DUFF: Go on - hit me!
