If X is positively correlated with Y, how do I write that down? So I'm in the field of neural implants and it often happens that I wish to write down that responses increase when the stimulus level is increased. Now what I basically would say in Dutch, my native language, and translated to English is:<blockquote>  X increases with Y</blockquote>so for example:<blockquote>  The amplitude (size) of the auditory nerve response increases with current level.</blockquote>Is this correct? Otherwise I have to write something like<blockquote>  The amplitude is positively correlated with current level </blockquote>which has too much of a statistical undertone in it (distracts from the message and may confuse readers). Or<blockquote>  The amplitude increases when the current level is increased.</blockquote>Here the sentence is, seemingly, needlessly long and 'increased' is used twice (reads a bit clumsy).
