She asked for a second date, then the day of told me she's not interested
I met my crush at a bar after DMing her on instagram following the fact that we matched on Tinder. The date went as well as I could've hoped and we ended up at my place. She was excited to escalate things sexually but I  told her that I like to get to know her first. It was clear her intentions were to hook up, but I thought it would be better to cut it at kissing. We continued to dance and hangout, and it was obvious we were both attracted to each other. On top of that, **at the end of the night she even asked me out on a second date at a museum during the next week.**

A few days later, I reached out to her to confirm the time to meet at the museum. She replied the day of saying she was not interested in pursuing anything further, but thanked me for the invitation. I'm confused because she asked me out for the second date, *not the other way around*. Not sure what I did wrong. Saw her on the train home too that day lol. This one hurts

Update: Thanks for the silver, stranger! Appreciate everyones thoughts and feedback. If anything changes, I will let you guys know
