DIEGO: George, I am happy to see you. How are you, my brother?
GEORGE: No more brothers, Diego.
DIEGO: Of course we are brothers. Why do you say that? You hurt me, George.
GEORGE: You fucked me, Diego.
DIEGO: I did not.
GEORGE: You went behind my back and you cut me out.
DIEGO: No, I never. I would not do that, George. Never.
GEORGE: I talked to Foreal, Diego.
