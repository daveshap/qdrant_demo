10 Lessons Learned from Dating Over a Year (Male Perspective)
Hello all, decided to give the male perspective for dating and how to shift through toxicity as a heterosexual guy. (Niceguys, this may help you lol)

&#x200B;

**1.) Don't send millions of messages.** Please don't do this. Aside from looking desperate, when you send too many messages at one time, you actually race through the conversation. It makes it hard to stay on topic and ruins the flow of a conversation. It also makes it less likely she'll actually read everything you wrote.

**2.) Don't be afraid to send more than one message.** This is not a contradiction to **rule 1**. Basically, don't feel like there are strict dating rules you have to follow. If there is a topic you are really interested in and passionate about, don't be afraid to seem excited to talk about certain topics. God forbid you might actually show some personality instead of just looking like a "cool guy".

**3.) Don't waste your time with girls that give short replies or act like they don't wanna talk.** If a girl doesn't seem interested in the conversation, just stop. It takes two people to talk.

**4.) Don't let her act like she's cooler than you.** This one is worded a bit funny but all I mean is that don't let her behave like you're always the one that needs to impress her. Most girls actually have ZERO game. That's because it's usually guys that hit on them. This lets them sit back and act like they are above it all sometimes.

**5.) Don't be afraid of silences**. <-- This is something confident people easily pull off. If you're always talking on a date, trust me, the other person notices it. People who are afraid of moments of silence come across as insecure and often times they are. Slow your pace when you talk, give her time to answer questions and when she does answer, don't immediately jump in as soon as she's done. Give her time to elaborate and make her feel like the ownership of the conversation is also on her. This is a major power dynamic when first meeting someone. Similar to **rule 4**, don't feel like you always need to impress her. Let her impress you. (If you're super into the topic then don't be afraid to talk more but as a general rule, slow your pace down and put her in a position where she feels like she needs to speak.)

**6.) How does she behave? How does she treat you and others around her?** One of the best indicators of a person's character is how they treat people they don't care about or that can't do anything for them. If she's inconsiderate when you first meet, then she's inconsiderate. That's not going to get better. (Do not mistake ppl being uninterested with inconsideration. Inconsideration is when you two are dating or if you two know each other. Uninterested is when she ain't interested in dating you or when you're just a guy in her DMs. Both cases, you should walk away.)

**7.) Know what you're looking for.** Are you looking for a relationship or sex? We all have our own dating rules, so if you're looking for a relationship, pay attention to how she presents herself to the world and her boundaries. No offense ladies, but if a girl gets sexual with me immediately, that's a strike against her as far as a relationship goes. I've had girls send me nudes within 20 minutes of talking.  If she gets sexual with you right off the bat, you need to decide whether that information would cause problems later on if you decided to date her. This is where **rule** **6** comes into play. If she's really a great person then lots of guys will still consider her gf material.

**8.) Don't put her on a pedestal.** Similar to **rule 4**. It's called a partner, not a boss. If you're always sucking up to her or telling her how amazing she is and how beautiful she is, she won't like you. Flip the tables, what if you had a guy friend always telling you how cool you are and how unworthy he is to be your friend? You'd probably be like yeahhhhh he's a nice guy but he's a suck up. We want people who view themselves as our equals to be our friends. It's the same with relationships. We want people who view themselves as our equals to be our partners. No one likes a suck up.

**9.) Don't pretend to be something you're not.** It's hard to be yourself with someone you've just met. But it's much easier to avoid pretending to be something you're not. If you like video games or if you hate clubbing (like me), don't be scared that you'll look nerdy. I've had girls who had pictures of them clubbing tell me that they actually didn't really like it that much and they only did it cause there was nothing else to do sometimes. Don't try and look cool by lying about your interests.

**10.) Be a decent human being.** There is a big difference between being nice and being kind. Try and be both if you can but if you are nice to someone don't only be nice hoping to get something out of it. Regardless of what happens, relationships, friendships, strangers, etc, the effort of being a good person even when it's hard is a reward in and of itself. If you let yourself get nasty too many times then eventually you'll just be a nasty person. Actions become habits and habits become part of who you are.

**Bonus Rule:** I've seen on niceguy videos where they will narrate themselves during texts. Yeah...don't do that.

I have a tendency to elaborate so probably made this longer than necessary but because it's Reddit, I figured the less misunderstandings the better.
