Relearning Skills Help
Hi for some background I recently graduated from college. My major was Web Design and Interactive Media and I minored in Digital Marketing. Recently I got offered a social media job. The problem is my last social media marketing class was in my Freshman year which was years ago. I wanted to know some tips to basically reteach myself social media marketing. Where should I start? If anyone is in the business I would love to hear from you! I think it's really interesting and wish I took the class more seriously than looking at it as a grade. Thank you in advanced !!!
