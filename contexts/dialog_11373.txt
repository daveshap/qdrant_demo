SEAN: Which one did you take, Will?
WILL: Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
SEAN: That's what you want?
WILL: Yeah, I think so.
SEAN: Good for you. Congratulations.
WILL: Thanks you. So, that's it? We're done?
SEAN: We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.
WILL: I just want you to know, Sean...
SEAN: You're Welcome, Will.
WILL: I'll keep in touch.
SEAN: I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
