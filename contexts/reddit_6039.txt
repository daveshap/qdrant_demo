Job description change
I need another opinion. I have a bachelor's degree and 4 years of office experience. I'm good at my job as an admin assistant. Staff was reduced due to COVID19 and I found out the reception will not be coming back. I will now be given those job duties that include cleaning the office completely bathrooms floors and all. I will also most likely lose my office to sit up front.

Losing my office sucks, but I worked hard to not have to have jobs that include janitorial work. 

Do I keep my mouth shut and do it? Or do I risk losing my job and tell how I feel about it?

It took me 2.5 years to find this job. It pays more than my last and had benefits such as health insurance that my last job didn't have.
I've been at this current job sense January. My boss told me she will be rewriting my job description for me to sign.
