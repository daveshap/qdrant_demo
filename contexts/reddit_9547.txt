Never stop haggling with cable, insurance, and credit card companies
This can't be repeated enough. If money is tight you can effectively be earning by being patient and diligent with customer service and lowering your bills. 


Internet - do an online speed test daily, it will pretty much never be at where they promised. Call them (I usually stick to live chat, I can do it while I cook) and ask for a refund for the past 72 hours. If you are lucky enough to have competition, show them a competing rate and ask them to match it. If you're bold, set a cancellation date for a week from now, they'll call and send offers for lowered rates daily, if they don't then after a few days tell them you're not cancelling. If you think you got an apethetic support rep, hang up and try again or ask for their superior. Persistence is key.


Car insurance - it isn't too hard to get a bidding war going. Go back and forth between a few companies to see who will go the lowest just be sure they're offering the same coverage. Show each company the offer from the other as you go. There are also a lot of discounts they may not advertise outright that you can discuss with an agent - loyalty, early pay, safe driving, paperless, bundles etc. You can also ask them about courses you can take over the weekend that will lower your rate.


Credit card - call once a month and ask if they'll lower you're rate or extend your credit. It takes 10 minutes and if you're not missing payments you'll be surprised how often it pays off. 


I spend an hour or so every other Sunday haggling with whoever I owe money and it has saved me tons over the years. I actually haven't paid for Internet in 6 months if you count the gift card I got for new customers (cord cutter, no TV).


Edit: here is where I meant by speed test http://www.speedtest.net for those not familiar.
