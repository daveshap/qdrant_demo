Bridge Hand Probabilities Each of the 4 players in the game of bridge get dealt 13 cards. One player and his partner can see they hold 8 of the heart cards so they know that the 2 remaining hands they can't see hold the remaining 5 heart cards. What is the probability that the hearts are split 0:5 among the other 2 players?If these other 2 players are called A and B, is it correct to treat each heart card as a Bernoulli trial and the probability for each one that player A has it is 0.5. Then a 0:5 split would be $2$ x $0.5^5$ since either player A or player B could be the one with all 5 hearts. Am I right in thinking this or is there more going on?
