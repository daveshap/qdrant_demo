JULIANNE: Nine years, we've seen each other through everything. Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times. The best times of my life, maybe. Just drinking and talking. Even over a phone.
DIGGER: Kindred spirits.
JULIANNE: No, he's nothing like me. He's like you. Only straight.
JULIANNE: He's the salt of the earth. Kind and loyal and generous. The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
DIGGER: He's still in love with you.
