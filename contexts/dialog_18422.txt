SAUNDERS: Hello.
JEFFERSON: Saunders--
JEFFERSON: Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
SAUNDERS: I'm not.
SAUNDERS: No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
JEFFERSON: That's funny. I thought all along-- Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well-- --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say-- Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
SAUNDERS: What are you going to do?
JEFFERSON: I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
