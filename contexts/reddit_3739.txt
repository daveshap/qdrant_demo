Why is dating so shit nowadays?
I don't understand dating anymore, it's so fucking confusing, it's beginning to turn into this like chore. I've been single for  3 years now, and for the entire 2019, i've been trying to find someone that is on Tinder or Badoo apps. Well ofcourse there are just those types of girls, which you think you hit it off very well in the chats, and when you suggest to go out they disappear. Getting random girls to go on dates with me wansn't easy, but I did go to alot of dates (I've gone out with like 20 girls) and I've just been so sad, because it never seems to go anywhere from the first date, either it's the classic "i'm busy" or you just get ghosted. It just feels like a routine at this point. At this point, you, the person who is reading this, will say something like: "Dating shouldn't be a chore, and you're suppost to have fun". How should I suppost to be having fun, when whenever talking to the other girl, they feel like, they have a gun pointing to their head, and don't share much about them?  I've been single for a long time, and I used that time to really find out what kind of person I truly am, what I enjoy, and what I need. I'm not miserable, I'm studying right now, have good friends, I enjoy making people, I love to cook and for hobbies I enjoy fixing cars, I don't get anxious when talking to girls, so I think i'm ready to be dating. Now, again, you the reader, will say something like: "Take a break". I did, like 6 times. I've reinstalled like tinder 6 fucking times, and still, theres nothing I found. I need real advice.
