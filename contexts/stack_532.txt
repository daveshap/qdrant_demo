Is there a tool that comprehensively shows/manages all applications? I am looking for something similar to Syanptic for debian packages, but a tool that manages not only debian packages, but also installed appimages, flatpak, and snap.  I think it would be very nice to have just one tool/place to see and manage all that is installed.  The way it is now, when an app is updated, I can't recall how I previously installed it - Do I download the debian file, or the appimage, or the flatpak, in order to do the update?  So, I have to go hunting around in my system in order to know how I should handle the update.  So.....  Is there such a tool?
