A Dating Handbook for Guys: How I've Had Many Successful Dates
**Disclaimer**: This isn't a rulebook. This worked for me and there is no one right way to date. Do whatever works for you. I don't mean for this to sound braggy either, I've been ghosted and had bad dates as well! I just found some things that helped and wanted to share.

Also, I'm measuring "success" as finding someone who reciprocates your feelings and shows mutual interest. Not necessarily "we had sex on the first date."

Let's begin.

**The app:**

* It's 2019, we're all on the apps, Hinge and Bumble I've had the best luck on, in that order. Make sure your photos are decent quality and show your face up close and whole body. 
NO shirtless mirror pics, no selfies if possible. Make sure your main (1st photo) is clearly only you so girls don't have to guess which one you are in a group photo.

* It's important to approach dating, as a guy, from the perspective that you are qualifying them. Too many guys are trying to impress, compliment, and put women on a pedestal. Once you match with a girl, see if she's even what you are into. Any connection there? Great, after 10 min or an hour (whenever you get a feeling she's what you're into) I would usually drop, "I'm not on here much, [my phone number] text me if you want." 9/10 times I'd get a text within 10 minutes. 

**Texting**:

* At this point you're seeing if you want to get a 1st date together. Usually I'd ask for an IG profile if they didn't have good pics to make sure they really look how they appeared in the dating app. 

* I like asking, "What are a few things you like about yourself that don't have to do with your appearance?" This requires a bit of depth and weeds out the superficial girls. Also, you get to know them on a slightly deeper level early on.

* I've run text conversations for an hour or a few days if I'm unsure about a date. At some point I'd say, "Do you want to get drinks some time?" Again, 99% of the time they say yes. Think about it, they matched with you, kept talking in the dating app, took your number down, texted you first, kept texting you for however long, so there's a high chance they agree to a date!

**The first date:** 

* Text her the morning of, "I'm excited to meet you later, I'll see you at [time agreed upon]!" This allows her to confirm she's going. If she doesn't respond she's not interested and is a shitty human being for ghosting you the day of. Let it go and move on.

* It's always drinks. I know it sounds boring but if the date is a disaster, doesn't look like her photos, is weird, you finish your drink and leave. You're not stuck eating, waiting for a check, waiting for a movie or game to end. 

* Know a little about the bar you're going to beforehand and pick a quiet area so you can actually hear eachother. 

* Get there 5 minutes early and order.

* Stand up when she arrives and give her a FULL HUG, no side hug, no fucking hand shake, no kissing, just give a solid hug (like 2 seconds) and say how nice it is to see them.

* Ask them questions! Remember you're seeing if this is someone you want to continue dating. Moments of silence are OK, maintain healthy normal eye contact but be direct. 

* After about 1.5 hours I typically say that I'm ready to call it a night if they are. It's good to end the 1st date on a high note. Ironically if you guys are having a good time and you call the date to a close this does seem to make them consider that you were not having a great time. Personally I just don't like sitting and talking for a long ass time. 

* ALWAYS PAY FOR THE DRINKS. They should offer but just fucking pay. Chances are you picked the bar, you knew the drink prices, and you shouldn't be taking people out if you can't afford a few drinks. If they offer to leave the tip I always let them. Paying can actually help out later, I'll bring it up again.

* Walk them to their car give them a hug and say, "I had a really great time." 

About 70% of the time the girl would text me when she got home thanking me for the drinks or commenting on the date being nice. 

Forgot to mention, get the door for them especially if you're driving. 

**MORE DISCLAIMERS: I wrote the above in a way that makes it sound like I'm literally saying exactly what to do, I'm not, I'm just saying that's what I've done. Every date is different and complex, I've made out at the end of a 1st date because I texted/talked to a girl for a week before, and then I've had dates where I texted the girl for 2 days before going out together so there wasn't as much chemistry yet. Do what works for you!**
