Hard finding entry-level jobs with current work history.
Hi all, hoping to find some help and guidance in approaching new jobs. I’m 23, M, live in NYC. I have a BA in Communications (focus in Media Studies), as well as a minor in Critical and Professional Writing. While in college, I became a barista and found I was actually very skilled at it—I quickly moved up at a couple of roasteries and ended up landing a job that was paying well, however I left because it was toxic and absolutely draining. The issue with the specialty coffee industry is there are many low-level jobs and very, very few higher level jobs (anywhere from 3-10 depending on the company).

I’m starting to regret this decision because I passed up applying for internships during school and now every job in my field requires some form of experience (not to mention, I don’t really care much about communications anymore to begin with). I guess my dream job would be some sort of proofreading / copy editing, but those are also hard to come by for someone without experience, and internships are too risky at this stage in my life now (and mostly only open to students).

Does anyone have any tips for someone without actual experience trying to get into another field? I’m not even super picky about the field, I just want to find something that isn’t customer-service focused. Thanks in advance!
