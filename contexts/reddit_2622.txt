Unprofessional or Just Overreacting?
I just received a call from someone who said they found my resume on careerbuilder and I looked like a good match for a job. He didn't even tell me the company name or what they do but he told me in order to keep going with that he needs 3 references from me and he's going to call them before he moves further with me ðŸ˜‚ I told him I'm not giving out random numbers to a guy I don't know and who won't tell me about the company or Job. He said said that's the only way we can move forward with it. I hung up on him then he called back and left me a voicemail saying his manager will be calling me at 3pm for 3 references. Anyone think I'm overreacting, or is this extremely unprofessional?
