Getting rid of a virus So I know Linux isn't supposed to get viruses, but it really looks like I have one. A tab popped in firefox saying an update was required and it wouldn't let me close it (it did not look like a legitimate firefox update), with repeated pop up messages saying information would need to be resent- everytime I selected cancel, it came up again. I was also unable to open the software centre.I assumed the problem was firefox-specific so used purge to uninstall. At first it seemed like it worked, but when I restarted my computer firefox was still there. I tried to run purge again, but it said there was nothing to delete. So I tried to delete the program files, which seems to have  gotten rid of firefox, except I still can't open the software center so I assume there's still a problem. I ran clamscan and it said there's no infected files<blockquote>  Known viruses: 6354850  Engine version: 0.99.2  Scanned directories: 37159  Scanned files: 146987  Infected files: 0  Total errors: 21365  Data scanned: 8522.39 MB  Data read: 9700.28 MB (ratio 0.88:1)  Time: 1658.820 sec (27 m 38 s)</blockquote>Next steps?
