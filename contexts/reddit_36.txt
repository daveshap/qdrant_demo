Im grounded but I already was miserable before
Hi so this might sound a little stupid compared to some of the other posts but hear me out

Last Friday I was invited to a party, I talked to my mom and convinced her to let me go. Seeing as this was my first high school party, I got Shit faced and threw up for at least two hours. My 18 yr old brother had to pick me up because I couldn't sleepover at my friend's house like that. It was pretty embarrassing.  Of course, I got in trouble wich is reasonable, but it makes my life so much harder. I struggle to keep up with my friends and I have a hard time fitting in because Im a lesbian and a little bit of a stoner. I NEVER get in trouble though and my home situation is awkward, my mom hasn't talked to me directly for three days straight. I haven't had my phone for four days.  I snuck my phone last night and saw a text from one of my friends who took me to the party (we don't see each other in school bc track ended) She thought I had been ignoring because I was mad, I tried to explain myself, but I'm worried that without my phone I can't do "damage control" I go to a small school and I don't want the wrong people talking about me. I'm the good kid in the family, my other siblings have done some pretty serious bad things and I'm just nervous without my phone

Does anyone have any advice to help me get my phone back without stealing it? I just want to gain trust from my parents, I'm a straight A and B student, I do chores without being asked, and don't usually cause problems... How do I make this work?
