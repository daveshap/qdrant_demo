I rather kill myself then working my entire life for greedy ceos and corrupt Politicians
You need money to live. You need to work for money. Well.. I don't want to work the rest of my life, even with the occasional vacation because I'd still have to return to the job. Similar to how no matter how happy/better I temporarily feel(rarely) but return to depression once my mind takes over. I can't do this for the rest of my life, nor do I want to.. so I'm thinking about it..

So please god why wonâ€™t you just take my life and end the suffering here and now!!
