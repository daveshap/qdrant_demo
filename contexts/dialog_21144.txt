MARGO: May you what?
KILLAINE: Oh nothing.
MARGO: Are you always this witty?
BRANDON: Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
MARGO: In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
BRANDON: Let me introduce you. Mr. Killaine, Mrs. West.
MARGO: Fascinated.
BRANDON: What'll you have, Margo?
MARGO: Martini.
BRANDON: You, Killaine?
KILLAINE: Scotch and plain water, I think.
MARGO: Warm water, no doubt.
BRANDON: What?
KILLAINE: A private joke.
KILLAINE: It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
BRANDON: You're not English.
MITCHELL: I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
MARGO: It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.
MITCHELL: Be nasty.
MARGO: I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
MITCHELL: In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
MARGO: She is beautiful. And young. No thank you.
MITCHELL: I say YES!
