Tips for work ethic improvement?
Recently I have found myself struggling with my nosediving work ethic in the office.....since 2016. After getting a standard Good Ol' American 9-5 Office Gig, I've been lazy and unmotivated in my work day. It's a frustrating and embarrassing realization as new "rules" are put into place for myself and my colleague to follow due to my inability to pick up the slack. Tasks and assignments fall my the wayside as I cannot see the urgency or even the reason for doing them. Little stuff like....printing copies or sending out an email blast. I'm an admin, so I do basic little stuff.

I don't know how to describe it other than I am completely un-invested in the work that I do. My job previous to this, I did lots of physical work such as packaging, counting, moving, and all around handling products. I was involved in meetings and discussions but the overall physicality of movement and sensation of *doing something* kept my mind sharp and heart happy.  

I'm worried that if my work ethic continues to landslide I'll struggle to find and enjoy any job. I can't quit, because of bills and a somewhat high col area and any jobs I search for just seem to be different versions of office-related Hell. I struggle with what I want my career to be due to feeling so far behind in life as is (26, shit degree, lots of time wasted, no valuable skills, etc)

There's many things I want to do, apply for certifications and start a freelance writing gig but my job has totally destroyed my self esteem and mental happiness to the point where everything is a big "why bother." I can't seem to find motivation, inspiration, heck even *joy* in anything. 

What's the way to fix this? Books, meditation, working out and yoga? How do I take that first plunge and start myself on the long path toward a better work ethic and an overall happier life? Most of all how do I care about working again?
