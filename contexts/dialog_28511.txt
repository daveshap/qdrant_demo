NICK: I never saw that before.
NORA: No. It's a Christmas present.
NICK: Who gave it to you?
NORA: You did.
NICK: You must admit I have good taste.
NORA: Finished with these?
NICK: Yes. I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
NORA: I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
NICK: That's not true. He never came near my tabloids. That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
NICK: Hello... send him up.
NORA: Who's that?
NICK: Macaulay.
