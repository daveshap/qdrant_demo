I was laid off this morning. The company has encouraged me to reach out with any questions I might have when I’m ready. What should I ask?
I was laid off a few hours ago because my company says they can’t find enough work given the difficult financial times. I worked for a boutique management consulting firm in a big city in Canada, in a small team of five. I had only been with them for 6 months, straight out of grad school, so I understand why it was me. This hasn’t happened to me before, so I’m pretty shaken up and finding it challenging to convince myself it wasn’t something I did. To add to my stress, my husband recently moved to Canada and has had trouble finding work himself. So now we’re both home without work, living off savings until either of us can find a job. 

I’m much more stressed out than my husband is right now and feeling very emotional. The company says they would offer a great reference and would like to help me in my job search. They’re also paying 4 weeks severance. 

When I’m ready to speak to them again, what should I ask? In the meeting, I sat blankly staring at the two owners and couldn’t really speak at all, so I haven’t said much to them. I think I want to take the weekend to collect my thoughts and then approach them with a few questions. Any suggestions of what I should ask and how I get over this feeling of embarrassment?
