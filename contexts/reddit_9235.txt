69% of Americans Have Less Than $1,000 in Savings
How does this stat not absolutely mean we are super F$/&? Babyboomers have pensions to rely on, but following generations do not have pensions and will still need tens of thousands in basic services and benefits per year. 

I really am not understanding how America can not devolve due to this imbalance?

Not sure if this is the place to unpack this question, but the perspective here should be interesting. Anywhere else I can post?
