Is socialism to blame for the crisis in Venezuela? Why or why not?
As you know, there is [increasing unrest](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/18/americas/venezuela-protest-explainer/) in Venezuela, the country is having shortages on things like [toilet paper and food](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/venezuela-is-falling-apart/481755/). To many, it would seem like socialist policies, but is there another cause? Is the cause of the collapse socialism or is it Hugo Chavez/Nicol√°s Maduro's poor leadership, or another factor?
