I got a job that suits my anxiety!
I'm very ecstatic, I got a job that literally fits around my anxiety! A family member of mine talked to another friend who works at an auto parts shop and she said she completely understands what I'm going through and the company will take me on! All I do is deliver parts and sweep that's it full time 8 to 5! Not only that but they're accommodating for my group therapy!
