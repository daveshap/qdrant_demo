I'm largely miserable living in Chicago.
It's been a day of randomers on Twitter sending me vulgar, racist tweets (I'm a white man) and people on the bus in Chicago violently threatening me. I have no one to talk to. People say 'talk about your problems', but that's an over simplification at best, you need to be careful who you tell your problems to, people can use it against you or offer their unsolicited terrible advice, and because I have no one to talk to, I am writing to you dear reader.

Like any place, if you have lots of money, Chicago is probably a fine place to live, but if not, the level of abuse, threats, inconsiderate behaviour & rudeness you face on a daily bases as you live in the poorer areas of the city is something I never anticipated when I emigrated here from Europe.

How was your day?
