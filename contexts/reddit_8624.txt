Was there anything unusual about the cause or timing of Andrew McCabe's firing from the FBI?
On March 16, former Deputy Director of the FBI, [Andrew McCabe,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCabe) was [fired just 26 hours before his scheduled retirement,](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-mccabe-fired-20180316-story.html) after nearly 22 years at the FBI. The last-minute dismissal [reduced and/or delayed some of McCabe's benefits under his government pension.](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/16/politics/andrew-mccabe-pension-if-fired/index.html) 

The firing resulted from a [report](https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/041318_McCabe-Report.pdf) by the Department of Justiceâ€™s inspector general that was just released to the public today. It [sharply criticizes McCabe](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/13/fbi-mccabe-fired-inspector-general-report-522580) for unauthorized disclosures to the media ahead of the 2016 election and lacking candor with investigators.

For his part, McCabe, a long time Republican, [believes he was targeted and eventually fired because of the work he did on the Russia probe,](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/16/17132418/andrew-mccabe-statement) and as part of a larger effort by the president and his supporters to discredit the FBI.

My questions are about the norms of firing for cause at the Federal level:

* The IG's report outlines four incidents of violation of FBI policy, but doesn't recommend what should be done with McCabe. Was his firing for lack of candor within established norms, even considering his long history with the bureau?
* McCabe had resigned his post months before the firing and was on paid leave at the time, so he wasn't working at the FBI, but the President had previously [urged the Attorney General to fire him](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/jeff-sessions-trump-mccabe.html) multiple times. Is it unusual for a President to recommend the AG fire a specific person at the FBI, even one who is not currently working at the bureau?
* Is it common that the IG would provide the report to the Attorney General so far in advance of providing it to Congress and the public? Is there evidence that the report was rushed to the powers that be in order to beat the clock on McCabe's pending retirement?
* Overall, even if the firing was justified, is there evidence to suggest it was done in a vindictive manner, or can such suggestions be chalked up to coincidence?
