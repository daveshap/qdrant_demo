RICHARD: The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a fourâ€”eyed worm.
PEGGY: Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
RICHARD: You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that. You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
PEGGY: What was?
RICHARD: Dancing with you.
PEGGY: You're a sweet man, Richard.
RICHARD: I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
PEGGY: You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
