BABY: Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
JERRY: Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
BABY: Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
JERRY: Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
BABY: Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
JERRY: What?
BABY: Cone.
JERRY: Huh... what cone?
BABY: Any cone, yeah... I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
JERRY: I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
BABY: I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
BILL: What about the tree?
BABY: Oh yeah, the tree.
