MOTHER: So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
JERRY: Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
MOTHER: Oh, really... ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
JERRY: I don't doubt that.
DENISE: No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house... ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
MOTHER: That's nice.
DENISE: Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
JERRY: And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
MOTHER: I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
JERRY: I was just kidding.
MOTHER: Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
MARY: No, just a little too old.
MOTHER: Oh really, well I hope something changes your mind some day.
BABY: Tiny's home.
MOTHER: What about R.J.?
BABY: Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
