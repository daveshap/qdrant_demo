BRUCE: What are you doing ?
SAUNDRA: I'm leaving.
ZACH: Look ! Look !
JOHNNY: Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
ZACH: I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
JOHNNY: You're paying the bills.
BRUCE: Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
SAUNDRA: What ?
BRUCE: You took an awful big risk back there.
SAUNDRA: Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
BRUCE: If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
SAUNDRA: I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
BRUCE: Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
SAUNDRA: NO ! I wouldn't do that.
BRUCE: Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
SAUNDRA: Why would he ? His parents are rich.
ANNOUNCER: So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
MATTHEW: Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
ANNOUNCER: Pick with expediency !
