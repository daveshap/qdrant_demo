JESSE: I'll settle for a third of that.
EARL: And if we refuse? Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
JESSE: True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
JESSE: Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80. You can buy 'em at any store. There's no way they can pin anything on me.
BOOTH: All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
JESSE: I'm all ears.
BOOTH: We're going to wait. All of us, until everything dies down.
JESSE: Well, I don't know...
BOOTH: That's the deal. If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
JESSE: Ok...I'll wait. For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
BOOTH: How much?
JESSE: I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
BOOTH: Two thousand...
JESSE: By Friday.
