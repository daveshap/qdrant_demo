Output impedance of a 4mA to 20mA current loop I have the most basic of basicness circuit. The implementation is a XTR115UA IC with a 40\u00b5A - 200\u00b5A input (based on sensor voltage) which is amplified to the desired 4mA to 20mA current in the current loop.I have been given the task to calculate / measure the output impedance of this current loop. The output impedance should be below 0.1 Ohms, but I don't see anything that gets me even close. Hope you can help.
