M35, single all my life, am I alone?
Hey,

I'm a good-looking Male 35 who have been single my entire life.  Partly because I always had little interest in relationships and mainly because I'm deeply involved in my hobbies. When I was 30 I found out that I have high-functioning autism which explains why I always had difficulties with social interactions, cues and empathy. 

I'm mostly unable to connect with other people on a deeper level. But I can connect deeply with my hobbies: art, music and writing. And I love dogs.

I have been dating but never clicked with anyone. I have also improved socially. But at this point in life, as you get older, I also get lazier dating and I have become comfortable with being alone and with my self.

Sure, I have missed out on love, relationships and sex. But I also have a deep connection with my hobbies.

Just sharing my 2 cents. Anyone who can relate?
