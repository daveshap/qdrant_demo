Guys of reddit, how does your behavior change when a girl becomes girlfriend material as oppose to just dating?
Basically I am wondering how you act when a girl becomes girlfriend material. 

I've been dating this guy and I am thinking it is going really really well. I think he is boyfriend material, but am wondering if he could start feeling the same?

We've gone out 5 times. He waited until the third date to ask me back to his, so I am thinking he is looking for something more stable than just a hook-up. He wanted to see me for a fourth date knowing it would be an early night with no possibility of sex due to schedules, which I also think is a good thing. 

He told me that he showed his friends my pictures and said they are all very curious to meet me. He did try to invite me to his friend's bbq but I was working... From what I am told guys typically don't bring you around their friends unless they are thinking about something long term. 

He will be away to visit home for a few weeks but made sure to see me the night before leaving. He said things like to make sure I don't forget him while he is away, and that he wasn't excited to go home anymore since he would be leaving me. He even made it a point to text me during his layover. 

I am overthinking this, and will of course just see how things play out. But I can't help but wonder if he maybe feels the same?
