How do you approach applying for new positions after getting fired?
Crossposting this to several subs so I can reach the widest audience possible. Reddit, I need some advice.

I got fired today for excessive tardiness. I won't go into details but suffice it to say that I was in my position for several years, and after today I've realized that I was very much in a "don't give a shit" kind of place, mentally. I fully acknowledge I was fired for valid reasons and have no beef with my former employer, this was entirely on me (INB4 "maybe you should just show up to work on time" - yup, I know, and this will definitely be my primary focus as far as personal development goes).

I held a corporate-level, senior SME/admin role, and I possess an extremely high level of knowledge and experience in a fairly niche field. I'm currently looking at some positions that could offer as much as a 50% pay increase from what I was making, in a similar or almost identical role, so obviously I was being underpaid - which I kind of knew already, and is probably the biggest factor in that "don't give a shit" attitude I had. I totally acknowledge that just getting lazy and not caring, rather than seeking a new opportunity, is totally my fault. But, now that I'm having this come-to-Jesus moment, I'm not sure how to proceed with future opportunities. Do I tell them I was fired for tardiness? Is it acceptable to decline discussing the reasons I left the company? How would this affect my chances for landing a new position, or salary/benefit negotiations? I appreciate any and all advice, insight, anecdotes, etc. If you have questions I'll try to respond as best I can. Thanks in advance.
