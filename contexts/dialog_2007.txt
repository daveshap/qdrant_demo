SIMON: Exactly what is your previous experience?
VINCENT: How about that pose? This is not fun... Give me some direction.
SIMON: Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it."
VINCENT: The fact that you haven't said, hold it" means I haven't done it right... is that correct? I haven't done it right?"
SIMON: No... Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching... an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
