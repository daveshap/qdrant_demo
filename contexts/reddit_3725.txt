Idea: Popular dating apps should host speed dating events in major cities
The idea would be that you have to sign up and maybe even pay a small fee, say $20. You get a couple of drink vouchers or something, these companies rent out a ball room, offer a bar and have hourly slots that you can sign up for.

I’m sure some sort of system can easily be created where 2 people who would like to see each other again can link up.

I personally would love this because it would be a controlled environment so women can feel safe and yeah there’s risks of sketchy people but no more than meeting someone from an app. 

It will also solve the problem of pointless conversations over the app, or matches flaking on meeting. Those who truly want to meet someone will show up!

Thoughts? 

I know there are already speed dating events in certain cities, but I think with a large population of younger people heavily relying on Apps such as Bumble and Hinge, it’d be cool if they hosted something. Obviously the requirement would be that you have a profile set up.
