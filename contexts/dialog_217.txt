FLOYD: Any ideas about the colour?
MICHAELS: Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
FLOYD: Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
MICHAELS: I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
