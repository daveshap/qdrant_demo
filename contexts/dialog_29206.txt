FUNGUS: WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
MAVERICK: DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
FUNGUS: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
MAVERICK: NO. NO GOOD.
JESTER: He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
VIPER: It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
JESTER: I've seen this before.
VIPER: So have I.
JESTER: Some guys never get it back.
FUNGUS: What are you doing?
MAVERICK: Saving them some paperwork.
FUNGUS: Since when did you care about paperwork?
FUNGUS: If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
MAVERICK: Not anymore.
FUNGUS: So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
