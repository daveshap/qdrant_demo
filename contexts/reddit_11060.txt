The amount of racism to Asian people has to stop.
My family is a neighborhood target to racism. Yelling slurs, vandalism, ice thrown on us, threats and even kicking our dog. While my school waa still open, some grade 9-10s cornered me and my friend, and gut punched us, kicked us, spit on us, slapped us, then ran. I was pretty hurt, but my friend was stronger than me, and sucked it up pretty quickly. All the school did was ask if I knew who did it, and then just made an announcement, saying racism is bad, and that's that. 

I've also had death threats made at me, water thrown on me, and been spat on. A LOT. Luckily, I always washed it of thoroughly with hot water and soap.

This god-awful racism isn't the answer to the virus cure. Beating up Asians won't do anything! Please, spread the word, MOST Asians only want peace, not violence, excluding the Chinese and North Korean government.

Thank you, for taking the time to read MY story.
