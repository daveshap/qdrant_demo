RIKER: Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
PICARD: We're not going anywhere.
PICARD: Deck five.
RIKER: You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
WORF: Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
PICARD: Picard to Crusher...
CRUSHER: Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
PICARD'S COM VOICE: And our people?
CRUSHER: They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
PICARD'S COM VOICE: Are they in any danger?
CRUSHER: Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
PICARD'S COM VOICE: Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
