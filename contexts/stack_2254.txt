How do I unlock Gold Mario in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe I've read conflicting information so I'm looking for the truth on what is required to unlock Gold Mario in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for Nintendo Switch. Most of what I read simply says you need to finish first in every race on 200cc. Does that mean complete each cup winning the gold? Or Do you have to win each cup with a gold and 3 stars (AKA a perfect 60 points). Also, do you also need to have the same completed for 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, and mirror modes?FYI here is a quick note on how to unlock the other gold items:  Gold Glider: Collect 5,000 coins in total. (See your stats screen for current total)  Gold Standard Kart:  Win every Cup with at least a single star on 50cc, 100cc, 150cc and Mirror Mode in Grand Prix.  Gold Tires:  Beat every Staff Ghost in Time Trial mode at 150cc. There's one for every track.
