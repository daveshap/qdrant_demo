I'm short 175 dollars on my till.
I don't know how I fucked up so badly. This is my third week as a cashier. The manager called me and said it might have had to do with a bad food stamps transaction. He sounded angry and I don't blame him. I can do nothing but wait until 2 pm tomorrow when I go in for work.
