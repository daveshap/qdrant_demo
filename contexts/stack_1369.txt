Is it possible to talk with Attiny85 via serial interface? Alright, I know this question is pretty silly, but I have stumbled upon different posts saying opposing things. So to make a conclusion, does anyone knows for sure if it's possible to send data via serial communication to one of Attiny85 pins?I would use CH340G to convert USB to serial from PC and then forward the info to Attiny85. Idea is to create a rather small device that could control 2-3 relays depending on the received commands. It would be nice that Attiny85 could reply to my requests and now just receive them (Rx/Tx) but Rx channel would work also.
