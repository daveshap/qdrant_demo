hired as a paraprofessional - advice?
today I got a call back and was hired as a paraprofessional at a middle school. I am socially awkward, anxious, and frankly, I am terrified of sucking at this job. Any tips on how I can be a good paraprofessional and deal with students and coworkers? Only experience I have is being a manager at taco Bell lol
