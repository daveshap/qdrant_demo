What evidence does Volume II of the Mueller report provide that suggest actions by the President were made with the intent to obstruct justice?
In [his report](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf)^1 released with redactions today, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller said:

>Beginning in 2017, the President of the United States took a variety of actions towards the
ongoing FBI investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and related
matters that raised questions about whether he had obstructed justice. The Order appointing the
Special Counsel gave this Office jurisdiction to investigate matters that arose directly from the
FBI's Russia investigation, including whether the President had obstructed justice in connection
with Russia-related investigations. The Special Counsel's jurisdiction also covered potentially
obstructive acts related to the Special Counsel's investigation itself."


What evidence in Volume II of the report suggest that the President was involved in an action that could obstruct justice and did so with the intent to obstruct?

Special request:  **Please cite volume and page numbers when referencing the report.**

This thing is an absolute beast of a document clocking in over 400 pages.  It is broken into two volumes, volume 1 on Russian interference efforts and links to the Trump campaign, and volume 2 on obstruction of justice.  Each volume has its own page numbers.  So when citing anything from the report, please say a page *and volume* number.

If you cite the report without a page number we will not consider that a proper source, because it's too difficult to check.

Please note, this is a mod post and will be moderated more strictly than usual due to the high level of interest in this matter.
