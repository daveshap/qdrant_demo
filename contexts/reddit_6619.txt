When can you not expect other employees to absorb the loss.
So a friend of mine is leaving her job. She is at a key position (a real worker bee) with this company who has layoffs every year for the past 5 years. She has not gotten a raise in 10 years. Her management thought oh her job is not that had so let's just add the responsibilities to a couple other people and NOT fill her position.

Another friend who works there confirmed that the manager had her write down all of her duties so he could divide them up to others. He was shocked when he found out the main part of her job was only about 20% of what she actually does.

He has now pushed out her responsibilities to no less than 7 employees that are now tasked with absorbing her duties as well as doing their own. 

What does it say about a company that can not afford to fill such a key position and that you have to add these duties to others?
