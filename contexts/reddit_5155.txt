Consistent late responses after job interview.
I have had 3 job interviews for 3 positions in the media/marketing field. For the first, I was asked to complete a mini social media campaign project after my interview, which I did and submitted on time. I received a follow up the next week thanking me for sending it in and they'd be in touch by the end of the week.

For the second position, my references were contacted and they responded that day.

For the third, I traveled 2 hours for an in-person interview, they were late to start, disorganized, and were not interested in looking at examples of my videography.

I did not feel great about the third interview, but for all three I did not receive any communication by the time they'd said they'd get back to me by. It was only until after sending them an email that I got a response saying another applicant had been selected.

I find this so disheartening. Is this so typical?
