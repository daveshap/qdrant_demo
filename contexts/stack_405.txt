Intel Core M underclocking at 10% battery I'm wondering if someone could point out how I could go about stopping my Asus UX305FA running Ubuntu 17.04 on an Intel Core M from underclocking itself when the battery is low. It goes from the normal 950MHz - 1000MHz down to 400MHz - 500MHz range when the battery gets to 10% power remaining.I'm hoping I can just edit a file without having to install a heap of tools to do it. Help would be much appreciated!
