FRAN: I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD How many guys were there?
FRAN: Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
BUD: Cut.
FRAN: So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
BUD: Too slow?
FRAN: Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff -- Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
BUD: You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
FRAN: Was he really upset when you told him?
BUD: Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
FRAN: Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
BUD: I'm sure that's the explanation.
FRAN: You really think so?
BUD: No doubt about it.
FRAN: Can I have that pad and the pencil?
BUD: What for?
FRAN: I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
BUD: You are?
FRAN: As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
BUD: Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
FRAN: Why not?
BUD: Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
FRAN: I don't like myself very much anyway.
BUD: Pick up your cards and let's go.
FRAN: Do I have to?
BUD: You bet. I got a terrific hand.
BUD: You sure you want to throw that card?
FRAN: Sure.
BUD: Gin.
