USB to RS232 without host (slave devices) I'm trying to get two slave devices (ie no host controller) to communicate.Slave 1: USB with FT232RQ chipSlave 2: DB9 Using standard USB to RS232 converter cables, I cannot get the two devices to communicate with each other. I believe this is due to not having a \"host controller\"? So to get communication I think I need to introduce a \"host\" controller between the two slaves:TTL &lt;-> Host &lt;-> RS232Am I along the right lines with this idea/solution?
