Driving trucks to escape poverty
Maybe this has been posted before, but I was at rock bottom back in 2008, after graduating from Florida State, with a Finance degree.  I could not find a job that works cover my living expenses, as well as my $56k in student loan debt.  I was to the point of selling plasma, stealing copper to sell, etc.  Then one day, it struck me.  I could let my apartment go, sell my personal vehicle, and hit the road to make some cash.

In 2009, I applied at all of the companies that offered training and took the first opportunity, as I knew I would not be there more than a year.  I made $57k that first year and have increased my salary substantially year after year.  This year I am on track to make $124k, and have made another $35k in the options market so far.  

Your cost of living can be as low as $100 a week, while making $2k depending on the lifestyle you choose.  

It is something to look into for you younger people that have no commitments at home.  It really changed my life, even though, I still practice frugality.
