BUDDY: Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
DOLL: No.
WASKI: Neither do I.
BUDDY: Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
WASKI: I do, too.
DADDY: Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
MOTHER: Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
DADDY: I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
MOTHER: Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
DADDY: All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
MOTHER: I'm not in the fourth dimension -- -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
DADDY: Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
MOTHER: Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
DADDY: You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
BUDDY: It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
DOLL: I think Daddy suspects.
BUDDY: No, he doesn't. Not really.
BUDDY: It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
DOLL: She's watching the car again?
BUDDY: Yeah.
DOLL: I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
WASKI: Yeah, I know.
BUDDY: Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
WASKI: I do, too!
BUDDY: All right, what do you know?
WASKI: Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
