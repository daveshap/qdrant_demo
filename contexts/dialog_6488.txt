LUKE: Yes, Boss. I got it right.
BOSS PAUL: Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
LUKE: No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
BOSS PAUL: Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
LUKE: I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
