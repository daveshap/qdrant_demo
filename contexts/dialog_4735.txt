PRINCESS: Is it true? Wallace is captured?
EDWARD: Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
PRINCESS: When will his trial be?
EDWARD: Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
ROBERT: Longshanks promised!
CRAIG: You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
