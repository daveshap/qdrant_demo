MS in Finance looking for your opinions regarding a thesis topic
Hello,

I am in my last year of grad school in Finance, I was thinking of using a topic on Foreign Investments.

Specifically, 'effects of foreign investments on (name of country)'.

Problem is, I feel like it it's more of an economics topic rather than a finance topic. Should I pursue this or no?
