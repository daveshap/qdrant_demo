NINOTCHKA: Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
PÈRE MATHIEU: But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
NINOTCHKA: The future of the common people.
PÈRE MATHIEU: That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu.
LEON: Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how? By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
NINOTCHKA: I don't like your following me.
LEON: I didn't follow you.
NINOTCHKA: Then how did you get here?
LEON: I always eat here.
NINOTCHKA: This is a place for workmen.
LEON: But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
