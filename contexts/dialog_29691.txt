GIB: Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
JANICE: Ten, Mr. Gibson.
GIB: And you still reach for your piece every time.
JANICE: Yes sir.
GIB: God! You have no idea how much that turns me on. I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
JANICE: Yes, sir.
HARRY: You better watch it. She might file on you for sexual harassment.
GIB: In her dreams.
