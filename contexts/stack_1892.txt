Verb form for the word \"ubiquitous or widespread\" the sentence I am trying to create is used everywhere in this report I am trying to proofread and semantically goes like this: \"Increasing the use of internet\" or \"making infrastructure establishment widespread across the nation\"I am looking for a verb more practical than \"making sth. widespread\" or a proper verb version of \"ubiquitous\"I have used \"spreading\" but it just does not sound correct to my ear.I'd be glad to get some answers. Thank you.
