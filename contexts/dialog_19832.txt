BELL: What was the bullet?
WENDELL: Wasn't no bullet.
BELL: Wasn't no bullet?
WENDELL: Yessir. Wasn't none.
BELL: Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense.
WENDELL: No sir.
BELL: You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
WENDELL: Yes sir.
BELL: Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
WENDELL: Sir, I don't want to picture that.
BELL: Well I don't either!
