How to deal with a Negative Coworker???
I've been working at {place} for about a year now, my co-worker and I are "friends" but she's probably the most toxic person I've ever met. She complains about literally everything, calls in sick atleast once a week, tells me I do "nothing", makes unnecessary comments towards me like "ew, never wear your hair like that again", acts like she's the manager (and makes sure everybody knows it too) , makes everyone try to feel sympathetic towards her, and she talks shit about everyone behind everyones back. How do I deal with this on a day to day basis? She's the type of person if I confront her she is going to be passive aggressive and snobby... (other people have left the position because of her) :( I hate this, going to work everyday is toxic.
