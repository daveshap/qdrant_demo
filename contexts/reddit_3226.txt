I got a raise and promotion, but it feels like a pay cut...Can you get a raise to a lower FTE salary than you had the previous year?
Hi all. So I got a raise and promotion today but I’m not excited at all about it. 

The promotion is easy. New title more responsibility. Cool.

The raise though feels like a pay cut. So last year my yearly salary was raised to $55k in June, which makes some of the math complicated. Apparently I was to make $52000 for the year, Counting the mid year raise. 

However, I had a family emergency and needed to take some unpaid leave, so I went down to 30 hours a week for a few months. I ended up making $50k in total at the end of the year (counting unpaid leave).

Fast forward to today. I get my promotion and a “raise” to $53500 a year. Apparently the got my 2018 salary from HR and gave me a 5% raise off of what I make last year. So my full time 2019 salary was counted off my reduced unpaid family leave salary of 2018. 

This makes no sense. Is this how raises work? All things equal I think the raise should have been based on my FTE salary, not the FMLA one? Because working full time this year I’m making less than last year? That and now I have a lot more responsibility. How to I talk to my company about this? I hate confrontation but this doesn’t seem right.

Tl;dr: made $55k, had to take unpaid leave, actually made $50k, got raise based on that.
