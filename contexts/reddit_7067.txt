Tips on how to get a job
Job experts of Reddit. What are some ways on how to ask for a job and show that I am interested in the position? My way of asking is saying "Y'all hiring" or "May I speak to the manager?" and the  ask for a job application. I greatly appreciate your responses and need a job to keep myself occupied in the summer. Thanks.
