EM: Hullo, son, how are you?
PEE: Are you feeling better?
ALEX: What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome? Em sobs. Pee comforts her.
PEE: There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your home's your home when it's all said and done, son. Em sobs.
