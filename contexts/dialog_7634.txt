MS. POMEROY: And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him? It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
DONNIE: Why should we care?
MS. POMEROY: Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
DONNIE: Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
MS. POMEROY: Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
DONNIE: Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
