KIRK: How did you know...?
MARTIA: There's a reward for your death.
BONES: Figures.
KIRK: We've been set up all along.
MARTIA: We don't get many presidential assassins.
KIRK: We didn't kill Gorkon.
MARTIA: Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.
BONES: I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
MARTIA: They'll make it look like an accident...
BONES: What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
MARTIA: I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
KIRK: How much time's left of your sentence?
MARTIA: Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
SPOCK: Any progress?
LT. SAAVIK: We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
SPOCK: Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
