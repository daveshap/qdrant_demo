Designing a 2S Li-ion charger with 5V 2A input I'm interested in designing a few similar charging circuits based on the specs of the title which is getting a charging for 2 cells in series(or more) from a 5V input.Now my question is:Assuming I can easily boost the voltage up what should I consider in the actual charging circuit in term of max safety?(Assumming I also have a BMS installed in this pack) and having other useful example circuits for multi cell charging would also be useful.Thanks for helping!
