EARL: I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail. We can't risk it.
BOOTH: What are you thinking?
EARL: I don't know...
BOOTH: You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one...
EARL: Well neither have I, but it's us or him. If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in. Besides, he's a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway.
BOOTH: I...I can't do that.
EARL: Okay then. I'll do it.
BOOTH: That's not what I mean.
EARL: Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do.
