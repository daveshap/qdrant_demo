How do you deal with parents/family/friends who ask about your employment status
and try to "help" you by sending useless job search sites to you / give you unsolicited "advice" when you're either unemployed or will soon be and don't need their input?

Example:  my dad sent me an email:

Here's a site you can use if you're ever searching for work.

(link to site with some openings that have nothing to do with my industry or for the few that do, I'm not qualified for).   His job site claims minimum hourly wages of $25-40/ hour in "part time government jobs", when in fact it's just an ad he fell for and is spamming me with.   I clicked his so called "great" "recommended" site and I see zero jobs openings in my field and some delivery driver part time gigs starting at $16/hr.   Thanks Dad, that's not my field and I have my sights set higher (for now).

What I really don't appreciate is his interference.  This email came the day after I called him for father's day.  I didn't mention anything about work and apparently me touching base with him about an unrelated matter, prompted him to think about "coaching" me on some useless spammy clickbait site? 

Then, as has happened in the past, he tends to follow up with me about my job hunting "progress", when the last thing I need is him checking up on me.   Instead I need to focus on sites and techniques that work for me and do them myself, without parental interference, at my own pace.   We don't even live together, I moved to another state to get away from my parents, I know how it sounds I'm ungrateful, but nothing pisses me off more than a parent who meddles in my life when I don't need him to.   Yes I could just delete the messages and move on, but I don't want to receive anything job hunting related from my family.  Is that too much to ask?
