Struggling on new job. Quit or terminated?
I need your advice and suggestion on navigating this tough situation my gf currently facing.

She has recently certified as Lpn and interviewed for a job. She had been working as medical assistant for last 3 years.Out of 2 job offers she picked the clinic option where she works 8-5. Other job offer was at the hospital with shifts. 

Now she is in her new job over a month now and training for it. Due to covid situation, clinic visits have become Tele medicine appointments and she needs to handle all phone calls constantly with patients. She is comfortable with handling patients face to face and providing hands-on service to them. Phone conversations and taking notes is difficult for her as English is not her first language. She is taking more time to perform her job. Supervisor is complaining that training period is Over and still my gf is not ready for the job. They gave 2 weeks time to get ready and become independent or will be terminated. What she should do in this situation? Should resign or wait for them to terminate her? Is one have advantages over other option? She doesn't have confidence that she would improve in two weeks time.
