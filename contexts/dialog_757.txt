ELAINE: Simon just ejected!
TED: Sit down, Elaine. If this bomb trick works we just might make it. Simon was a fool to eject now.
ELAINE: You mean...
TED: That's right -- premature ejection.
ELAINE: What will happen to him, Ted?
TED: The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds. He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
TED: Are you afraid?
ELAINE: Not when I'm with you, Ted.
TED: I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
