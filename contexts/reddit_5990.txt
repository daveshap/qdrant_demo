What fields can I break into by adding a certificate/associate's degree on top of my (useless) liberal arts BA? Has that worked for anyone here?
 Beyond going back to school for a different 4 year degree, what kind of education can you get that means something to a potential employer? Before I left the US to teach English in Vietnam I had applied to 500+ jobs after getting laid off. I was only at my first job for a year, and it took me a year of unemployment after college to find that job.

So, before leaving for Ho Chi Minh City, I had been unemployed for an additional 1.5 years and my spotty, unemployment-filled resume coupled with my German and Scandinavian Studies degree made me an unappealing candidate to say the least. Without additional transferable experience or valuable education that isn't teaching-related, if/when I decide to move back to the USA, I am just going to be in the same position again.

My resume includes a few years of various digital marketing volunteer gigs and a couple internships. By the time I leave Asia there will also be a few years of teaching English on my resume which is either great or perceived as an extended vacation depending on the employer.

Some examples of education I hope could jump start my transition into a new phase of life:

* paralegal certificate
* IT/Programming certificates
* digital marketing related certificate like SEO
* digital marketing related programming 
* something that could lead to international work because I have experience adapting to a new culture
* watchmaking school (one of my interests)

So, I must be missing a lot here... what else can you think of? Has doing this worked for you? Please keep in mind that this post is angled towards liberal arts degree holders.
