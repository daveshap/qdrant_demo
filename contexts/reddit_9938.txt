Would this type of book have interested you when you were choosing a college?
I am embarking on a project, and I want to see if it seems worthwhile to potential customers.

It will be a book that will have interviews with a couple dozen students on their experiences with picking a college, and what they wish they would have known now. I will sell it as an e-book for probably $4. Is this something that would have interested you as a high school junior/senior, and do you think you would have bought it?
