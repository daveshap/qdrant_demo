KRISTINA: Bye, Dad. See you in the morning, okay?
GEORGE: I'll be here.
MIRTHA: What do you want?
GEORGE: You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
MIRTHA: Yeah. She told me. You walk her to school.
GEORGE: Yeah, so I've been thinking. I love her, y'know? I kind of want to have her. I've been away for so long. Make up for the missed time, you know?
MIRTHA: I haven't seen one dollar from you. You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
GEORGE: Yeah, well. I'm working on that. I've got something going.
MIRTHA: Yeah? I better see some money out of it.
GEORGE: Yeah, you will. Of course.
MIRTHA: Hey, look. You start paying, who knows what will happen. You're a good father, George. I always gave you that. But you've got to talk to her.
GEORGE: Yeah.
MIRTHA: She's getting big. Getting her own ideas.
GEORGE: I know. Well, that's all I really wanted to say. So, okay, then.
MIRTHA: Hey, George. You okay?
GEORGE: Yeah. I'm fine. I'm good.
