DANNY: : What are you up to?
COLETTE: Nothing.
DANNY: What do you want from me, Colette?
COLETTE: I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
DANNY: It gets me through the day.
COLETTE: You really need to lighten up.
DANNY: Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.
COLETTE: This has nothing to do with him.
DANNY: So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
COLETTE: Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
DANNY: How much time do you have?
COLETTE: What is wrong with you?
DANNY: How much time do you have?
COLETTE: You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
DANNY: Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
COLETTE: There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
DANNY: You don't like the tune, find another station.
COLETTE: What are you hiding, Danny?
DANNY: Therapy session is over.
COLETTE: You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
DANNY: No. But I'm the only one with my sad story. And that's how it's gonna stay.
DANNY: Excuse me?
GARCETTI: Several possession charges, but nothing major.
DANNY: Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
GARCETTI: They have. But they never found a lab.
TANNER: That's because he doesn't have one.
DANNY: Whata you mean? He told me -
TANNER: Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers. As least that's what the word is.
DANNY: What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
TANNER: That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
GARCETTI: You're lucky, Flynne.
DANNY: Funny, I don't feel lucky.
GARCETTI: We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
DANNY: What if he caps me before you can make a move?
TANNER: Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
GARCETTI: Don't we always take good care of you?
DANNY: Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
GARCETTI: You mean the menacing red car?
DANNY: What? Is it bad?
TANNER: I'm afraid so, Danny.
DANNY: Who is it?
