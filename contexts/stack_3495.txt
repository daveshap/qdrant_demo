Integrate OData pentesting tool to ZAP add-on We are currently working on a ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) add-on designed to facilitate the pentesting of our new framework. Our solution is using OData so we were wondering if their was existing tools that we could have integrate in the add-on. I heard about OyeData, but it doesn't look like you can easily call it from another application. SQLmap would have been easy to call from our add-on, for instance, but it does not support OData testing.Have you ever encountered an testing tool that could fit our requirements ? (Perform SQL injection through OData, and be \"simple\" to call/integrate from an external application ?)
