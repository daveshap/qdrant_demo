Tired of it all
Who else is just tired of it all? Tired of making everyone else happy, tired of dissapointing everyone, tired of constantly pretending you are strong and nothing can bring you down..? 

Growing up whenever I tried to talk about what I am feeling no one listened and would always change the subject. So I would never talk about it and now that I am an adult and married it's really hard to talk about how I feel because everyone expects me to be strong..
