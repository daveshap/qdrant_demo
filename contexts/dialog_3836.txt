BLADE: I wouldn't worry about it.
WHISTLER: I am worrying. Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.

WHISTLER: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
BLADE: It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure. Reckless, quick to anger -- You said it yourself, Whistler. Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards. Where'd they get their intel?
