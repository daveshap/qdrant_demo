PENDERGAST: I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
CUTHBERT: If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
PENDERGAST: I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
CUTHBERT: We've been operating in the red for years. That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit. It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No. I don't want to think about that.
D'AGOSTA: We all love the museum. I come here myself with my kids. We're trying to work with you.
CUTHBERT: I appreciate that.
PENDERGAST: If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
CUTHBERT: Do they have to wear uniforms?
PENDERGAST: Yes.
CUTHBERT: I don't want to scare people.
PENDERGAST: I understand. But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems. Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
KAWAKITA: What do you make of it, Margo?
MARGO: It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
