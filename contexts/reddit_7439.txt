Getting into classes outside of your program?
So I’m interested in some courses but they are not part of my program. I emailed professors about joining and some were “sure thing! Happy to have you!” And others were “no, this course is for those enrolled in the program only!” (But some prof. were the same course and one said yes and one said no).
Is this common? Why are some prof. so smug about letting me in even though they have tons of seats open and classes already started?
