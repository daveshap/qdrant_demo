ILSA: Hello, Sam.
SAM: Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
ILSA: It's been a long time.
SAM: Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
ILSA: Some of the old songs, Sam.
SAM: Yes, ma'am.
ILSA: Where is Rick?
SAM: I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
ILSA: When will he be back?
SAM: Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
ILSA: Does he always leave so early?
SAM: Oh, he never... well... he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
ILSA: You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
SAM: Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
ILSA: Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
SAM: I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
ILSA: Play it, Sam. Play As Time Goes By.""
SAM: Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
