MICHELLE: Sire! I -- How did you --
LOUIS: How did I get in? You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
MICHELLE: ... Nothing.
LOUIS: A letter. May I see?
LOUIS: From Raoul. He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
MICHELLE: Raoul... is in love...
LOUIS: Enough of this, our dinner waits.
LOUIS: The food doesn't please you?
MICHELLE: It's lovely. It's just...
LOUIS: This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead. You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption. Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
MICHELLE: I... we are humble people...
LOUIS: Wait, no! Do not be ashamed. The straits of your family need not be permanent. It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
MICHELLE: You would do that, your Majesty?
LOUIS: My dear, I've already done it.
