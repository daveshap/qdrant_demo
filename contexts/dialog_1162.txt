CONSTANZE: Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
MOZART: Stanzi!
CONSTANZE: No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
LEOPOLD: Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
MOZART: Papa!
LEOPOLD: Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
MOZART: No one calls you that.
LEOPOLD: She does. She says I sleep all day.
CONSTANZE: And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
LEOPOLD: And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
CONSTANZE: Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
LEOPOLD: So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
CONSTANZE: Do you hear him? Do you?
