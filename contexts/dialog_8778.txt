UTHER: I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
MERLIN: Just show the sword.
MERLIN: Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow. Speak the words.
UTHER: One land, one king! That is my peace!
