Reflections from someone who spent way too much time on this sub
Here is my parting advice:

\-Apply to match schools. Don't be me and only apply to uber safety and uber reach schools.

\-Don't obsess over your decisions. Seriously, try not to do it. I spent so much time checking this sub to see if likely letters were out for X school or if everyone had gotten Y email, and it was such a waste. Send your apps in and try your best to focus on other things.

\-Someone told me this, and it helped me a lot: The best school isn't necessarily the best school for YOU. Prestige is not king. You can still be happy and successful and awesome if you don't go to a highly ranked school.

\-For me, money was my #1 factor. I got into higher ranked schools than the one I chose, but I could not afford them (and I also got rejected from a lot of higher ranked schools  lmao). This is another reason a "better school" doesn't make someone better. I was so obsessed with prestige, but it's really so stupid.

A year ago I read posts like these that said things like these, and I kind of brushed it off because all I was focused on was getting into the best ranked college possible, but I was focusing on entirely on the wrong thing to the point where I was missing opportunities to better myself and succeed.

Through this process, just keep everything in perspective. Your hard work and character are not defined or questioned by your admissions decisions. Enjoy this year as much as you can, and focus your energy only on what you have control over.

Edit: I really didn't think anyone would see this post lmao, but thank you guys for the love. To you rising seniors, good luck and peace to you, and to my rising freshmen, we're gonna kill it, so let's enjoy life and bring some good to this world. :)
