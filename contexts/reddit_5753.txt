Getting a job when the cards are stacked against you?
I'm trying to help my boyfriend get a job. It's not that he isn't trying, but it seems so hopeless with how much stuff he has going against him. I'll spare you the sob story and just say that he's lived with a very abusive and controlling father most of his life, and that he's trying to break away from what. But he has a small list of (apparently) huge problems that make getting hired difficult, to the point that most of the employers he applies to (mostly online) don't even bother calling to say they're not interested.

* He has no professional references or experience (nobody will give him a chance)
* He's too old to get help from most job corps (mid 30's)
* His parents couldn't be bothered to save money for college, but he did graduate high school
* He can't drive (Eye problem he was diagnosed with as a teenager legally forbade him from it. He can't afford to get it looked at again to see if he get that undone. So it needs to be something easily driven to or walked to when his dad is being uncooperative)

I can't help him very much due to living in another state, but I want to do what I can. I'm working on getting a job myself so that way I could possibly get him down here, but I want him to be able to have money and a means for caring for himself should anything happen. Any possible advice is appreciated, but I do have a few questions:

* When is the best time of the month and/or year to apply for a job?
* If we're applying to the same bunch of places, what's the appropriate amount of time to wait between applications or asking if they're hiring?
* Is it easier to get employers to notice you if you call their location or go there to ask in person?
* Is there anything similar to job corps, but for all ages that can help him?

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I really just want to help him achieve some sense of financial stability, but I don't really know who or where to reach out to.
