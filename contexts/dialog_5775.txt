ARLO: Uh-oh.
MASON: What?
ARLO: This thing just went up a degree. Ice cream's not workin'.
MASON: This river's fed by a glacier. Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
ARLO: Okay.
ARLO: Worth a try.
MASON: 
ARLO: Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
ARLO: ...did you?
MASON: You're fucked, man.
ARLO: See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
ARLO: ...-tion?
MASON: Hey, I didn't steal the truck. You...
MASON: ...stole the truck.
ARLO: Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck. Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
ARLO: ...piece of shit was worth.
MASON: It won't even start half the time.
ARLO: You know what I'm sayin'?
ARLO: I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
ARLO: And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
ARLO: ...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it. But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
ARLO: ...or nephew or some good old boy...
ARLO: ...just ready to just slide him right in there. And what about me, huh? What about Arlo, huh? What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
ARLO: ...overdrawn bank accounts.
ARLO: Nobody's lookin' out for my interests. My credit was fucked! And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped. So I split.
MASON: So you took his...
MASON: ...truck.
ARLO: So I took his truck, yeah.
MASON: Yeah.
ARLO: You know.
