SZPILMAN: Dorota!
DOROTA: I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
SZPILMAN: How are you doing?
DOROTA: Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out. This is disgraceful.
SZPILMAN: Don't worry, it won't last long.
DOROTA: That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
SZPILMAN: I'll see you...soon.
FATHER: To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
SZPILMAN: How will we sleep?
