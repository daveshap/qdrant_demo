Is it mandatory to subset your data to validate a model? I'm having a hard time getting on the same page as my supervisor when it comes to validating my model. I have analyzed the residues (observed against the fitted values) and I used this as an argument to discuss the results obtained by my model, however my supervisor insists that the only way to validate a model is to make a random subset of my data, generate the model with 70% of it and then apply the model on the remaining 30%.The thing is, my response variable is zero inflated (85% of it, to be more rpecise) and i prefer not to create a subset as it is already very difficult to converge to a result. So, my question is: what are the possible (and scientifically acceptable) ways to validate a model? Is subsetting data the only way? If possible, reference your questions with articles/books so I can use it as an argument when presenting my alternatives.
