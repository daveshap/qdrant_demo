QGIS - Calculate net area of classes after raster classification I searched on the net but could not get the specific answer. Request for the same.I have slope map of the area (in percent, derived from r.slope.aspect). I need 4 classes, as, area of slopes less than 5%, 5 to 15, 15 to 20 &amp; above 20%. I got it done using singleband psuedocolour. Now I need the net area for these 4 classes.How to achieve this in Qgis? Raster to Vector conversion should be avoided as possible. r.stats or r.report gives huge reports. It counts the individual cell instead of class &amp; process accordingly, I think. I only need area for above 4 categories.Or should I generate all together new raster maps, using raster calculator and with expression as Rasterlayer@1 &lt; 5, etc... &amp; again merge/ integrate into one final..
