JASON: We're here. Where the hell are you?
STANK: Back here. At the end of the block.
STANK: You got the cash?
JASON: You got the shit?
STANK: Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot. Leave your car and walk over here.
JASON: Let me see it.
STANK: Let me see it.
JASON: Where is it?
STANK: I can't carry it in my pocket, man. And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop. You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
STANK: Don't worry. It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it. Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone. Go on, I ain't shitting you.
JASON: Fuck it. Alright.
