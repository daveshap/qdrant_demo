Where should I look for the Necronomicon? In \"The Curious Expedition\finding the Necronomicon on Normal or higher difficulty will unlock H.P. Lovecraft as a playable character. In one of my first games on Easy difficulty, I found it, but I can't remember what type of location it was at (tomb, shrine, cave, etc.)Is there a specific type of location that I look for the Necronomicon in, or is there just a low-percentage chance to find it?
