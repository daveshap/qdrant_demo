Join attributes of polygons to another polygon feature based on location QGIS I have two large polygon data-sets. One highlights the building footprints for a county and the other highlights the parcel boundaries for the same county. Some parcel polygon features have multiple building footprint polygons that are within the boundary of the parcel polygon. I want to take each individual building footprint polygon feature and join the parcel ID number to each building footprint feature that lies within the larger perspective parcel polygon feature it's located in. The actual exported feature I want in the end are the building footprint features with the parcel ID # in the attributes.
