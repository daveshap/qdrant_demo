How do I help my depressed gf
my gf seams to be really close to serious depression I talked with her the other day and she told me all this stuff about how sad she is how nothing excites her how she doesnt feel it matters If she died. all of this is new to me and I think very logically so my natural answer is to come up with a solution. like "tell me the things that make you happy" "try to think more positive" stuff like that but this isnt the correct answer I know she doesnt want a solution right now but I don't know what to give and I want to help her. advice?
