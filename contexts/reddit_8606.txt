Are there any relevant precedents for President Trump's proposed pardons?
[President Trump is considering pardoning several persons accused of war crimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/us/trump-pardons-war-crimes.html):

- [Edward Gallagher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Gallagher_(soldier\)), who is currently facing trial

- [Nicholas Slatten](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/blackwater-security-guard-convicted-in-2007-iraqi-civilian-massacre-at-third-us-trial/2018/12/19/e8b3d8ac-fd5f-11e8-ad40-cdfd0e0dd65a_story.html?utm_term=.d19522a88191), who has been found guilty

- [Matthew Golsteyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_L._Golsteyn), who is currently facing trial

- [a group of Marine Corps snipers accused of desecrating corpses](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/02/08/marines-urination-afghanistan/1903241/), which subsequently had some convictions thrown out due to [unlawful command influence](https://www.armytimes.com/opinion/medals-misfires/2017/11/15/medal-in-taliban-urination-case-the-military-court-was-right/)


Of note is that in two of these cases, the judicial branch has not made a determination of guilt yet. 


As an example of how a previous presidential administration acted, President Nixon commuted the sentence of [William Calley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Calley), who was the single officer held responsible for the U.S. Army's role in the My Lai massacre. This act was considered controversial at the time, and [considered by some to set a poor precedent](https://famous-trials.com/mylaicourts/1623-daniels-ltr) for how the U.S. military should conduct itself.

EDIT: Per request, I am adding a [source](https://www.apnews.com/1b76890a47414e698812fd22daa033a6) in which Trump is quoted discussing the potential pardons.

EDIT2: I am adding in some useful links pertaining to the definition of war crimes.

The United States is a signatory to the [Third Geneva Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Geneva_Convention), which relates to the treatment of Prisoners of War.

The United States is a signatory to the [Fourth Geneva Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention), which relates to the treatment of civilians.

The Geneva Conventions define what are considered [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime#Geneva_Conventions).

The International Committee of the Red Cross has a write-up on how [desecration of the dead](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_rul_rule113) is covered by multiple international treaties, including the Geneva Conventions and military policy for the major militaries of the world, including the United States.
