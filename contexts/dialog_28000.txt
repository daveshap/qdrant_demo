LOUISE: For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
THELMA: Are you sure we should be driving like this? In broad daylight and everything?
LOUISE: No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
THELMA: Oooooweee!! You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
LOUISE: You think you've found your calling?
THELMA: Maybe. Maybe. The call of the wild!
LOUISE: You're disturbed.
THELMA: Yes! I believe I am!
JIMMY: I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing! Christ! You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
HAL: Tell us about him.
JIMMY: Just some young guy. Around twenty years old. Dark hair.
