DOCTOR FULTON: Feeling better?
KATHY: I just can't believe it.
DOCTOR FULTON: You don't want to believe it. It's a normal reaction.
KATHY: How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before. This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
PETER: Jeremy would have never killed himself.
FRANK: Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
PETER: This is insane! Can't you see what's going on. The killer wants me out of the way. He's setting me up.
ANDY: You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
PETER: What?
