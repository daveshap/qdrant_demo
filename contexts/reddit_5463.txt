When interviewing for an administrative assistant position in a law firm, how much do they expect me to know?
I have an interview for an administrative assistant position in a few days and it is a massive improvement from my current job working in a restaurant. I am extremely excited for this opportunity and I definitely don't want to blow it. I am really nervous though about living up to expectations. I definitely think I have the personality for this type of work and believe that I am qualified, and I know I can learn all of the skills necessary. However, I'm nervous about how much they expect me to know going in.


I understand the position involves taking notes, scheduling appointments, drafting letters and booking travel, but how much do they expect me to know on my own?


For example, when booking appointments will they expect me to know that they use google calendars? Or will there be some other calendar app that's standard? I've never purchased a plane ticket even for myself, will it be as simple as clicking purchase and forwarding an email to them with all of the info? I've never worked in a legal environment before, will I be expected to know basic legalese on my first day? Or is it acceptable for me to learn it on the job? Where do I go to learn these things? Thank you so much for any help in advance.
