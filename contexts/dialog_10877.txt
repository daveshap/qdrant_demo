VENKMAN: I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
STANTZ: No! Nobody ever built them like this! The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius. The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
VENKMAN: Who was the architect?
STANTZ: He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
SPENGLER: Of course! Ivo Shandor, I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE. He started a secret society in 1920.
VENKMAN: Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
SPENGLER: Yes. After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive. And he wasn't alone. He had close to a thousand followers when he died. They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
VENKMAN: She said he was the Destructor.""
SPENGLER: Who?
VENKMAN: Gozer.
SPENGLER: You talked to Gozer?
VENKMAN: Get a grip on yourself, Egon. I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
