Looking to Recruit Postgraduate Students for Study of Experience with Online Postgraduate Education Programs
Hello, r/GradSchool – 

I am a UX researcher currently conducting remote, moderated usability tests and feedback sessions around online postgraduate programs and enrollment websites on behalf of several clients.

The purpose of this study is to **gather evidence about the overall experience of online postgraduate programs and enrollment websites** in order to better optimize the experience for the needs of prospective postgraduate students – what works, what doesn't, how they can be made better.

**If you are considering, currently enrolled in, or recently graduated from a postgraduate program in the following fields, I would like to include you in the research:**

* Digital Marketing/Data Analytics
* Mental Health Counseling
* Engineering
* Cybersecurity
* Social Work
* Business
   * Strategic Leadership
   * Finance
   * Marketing

The sessions have been running between 30 minutes to 1 hour, and all participants will receive a **$50 Amazon gift card as a thank you for your time**. Your information will remain private, and session recordings will be used strictly for data collection purposes.

I have several spots remaining with a goal of completing this research by the end of next week (March 14th). Below is a link to the research participant form if you are interested, which assists me in pairing you with the appropriate session focus.
