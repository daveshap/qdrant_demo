Fiance and I put in two weeks notice and got fired. What is a good gig to make a few extra hundred a week in between jobs?
 For extra background, we're college students going into nursing starting at a hospital as CNAs. Old job decided they didn't need us for our last two weeks. We're not in dire straights or anything, but a few hundred a week would certainly be nice for some peace of mind. We can't start early and need to do a few orientations as well as get some boosters, etc for the new job in the next two weeks.
