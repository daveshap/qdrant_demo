Does anyone’s anxiety manifest as irritability or negative thoughts towards yourself?
I have a lot of physical manifestations from anxiety like chest tightness, nausea, headaches etc., but I find I often get irritable if I’m in a social setting for too long. I’ll snap at the people around me, I get disoriented and withdraw. 

As well, I notice a tonnnnn of negative self talk. Maybe this isn’t so much anxiety, but I notice it nonetheless. For example, I had to write a paper for one of my classes and ended up doing extremely well on it, and I couldn’t just accept that I had done well. I kept thinking things like “oh maybe everyone did well” or “maybe the prof just graded everyone really easily.” I also get irrationally angry at myself for having my anxiety in the first place. I’ll catch myself saying things like “why is your heart beating so fast, my god you’re just getting on the bus, it’s not a big deal.” 

Anyone else? I’m curious!

Edit: Thank you for all the upvotes and comments everyone!!! I really thought the irritability and negativity was uncommon with anxiety, it’s so comforting to know it’s not. Thanks for sharing your experiences with me, it helps me more than anyone will know.
