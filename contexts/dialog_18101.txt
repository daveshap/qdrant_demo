SWANBECK: Sorry, Ethan. I don't quite know where to begin. Any suggestions?
ETHAN: You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
SWANBECK: Why not? You've done just about everything else on this operation.
ETHAN: I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
SWANBECK: Of course it was. Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there. You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days. At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face. Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus. Not even antibodies.
ETHAN: Yes, I gathered as much.
SWANBECK: And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
ETHAN: Yes.
SWANBECK: And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
ETHAN: Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
SWANBECK: But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus. I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
ETHAN: By fire. That's the best way, really.
