University is awesome. Oh, and a few application tips.
Hi seniors! It's been almost two months since I've started university, and I just wanted to share a few of my thoughts on my university experience so far for y'all: 

University is not like high school, where you hang out with the same friend group every day. You get to know a lot more people here, in your dorms, clubs, and classes. You still have a few friends that you hang out more than others, of course, but your social circle really expands. It's really the best of both worlds!

I used to go to a small high school (\~40 people per grade) and now am at a large public university. There's a lot more students here, with a more varied set of backgrounds, interests, and experiences. This means that it's a lot easier to "find your group" in university than in high school, simply because you're more likely to find a group of friends that you vibe with. Also, universities tend to accept people with certain traits, so you may find that you'll share more of the same interests/have similar views or habits with many of your classmates in uni than in high school. 

You also have a lot more freedom! As a high schooler, I always heard people say that university is what you make of it, and thought it was really cliche. But it's true: you're free to do anything you want in university, be it sleeping or partying or studying all day. For example, a lot of my classes are webcast, so I don't go to those lectures (not saying that you shouldn't go to lectures--you should show up if you think you need to!) and instead spend that time doing activities I enjoy (club stuff, personal projects...etc). Personally, I loved the freedom, because I'm not stuck in classes that I don't enjoy all day and can really explore what I'm interested in. 

Also, there's ALWAYS something going on, whether that be hang outs, club events, or residence hall socials. I'm someone that likes being kept busy, so it's really nice to always have something to do. 

A few application tips:

* Brainstorm a few noteworthy stories of accomplishments that you want admissions officers to know. For each of your accomplishments, you should also be able to tell an intriguing story of the obstacles you faced, how you overcame them, and what you learned from the experience. For example: "I won Best Delegate in a national Model UN conference. In the beginning, I felt nervous about presenting in front of a large committee. However, I told myself to not think too much and just give it my best shot. As I delivered my speech, I realized that it wasn't as intimidating as I had imagined, and that presenting my ideas and research was actually fun. Through that conference, not only did I gain valuable public speaking and debate skills, I also learned to overcome my fears in situations outside my comfort zone." From a brief outline like that, you can expand your "stories" to full length personal statements or incorporate them into your short essay answers. Oh, and having a few stories like these on hand also helps in interviews! 
* Start early: If you haven't started your college apps yet--do it now. It's better to have a bad first draft that you can edit in the coming weeks than a good idea in your head. 
* Revise revise revise: When I was applying, I would read over my application essays at least once every two days, and usually I'd be able to catch some mistake/improve some part of my answers every time I read through them. After two months of constant revision, my essays looked A LOT better than their first incarnations. Oh, and ask others to read through your essays as well! Try to find the people who would be the most critical of your essays--they usually give the best advice.
* Keep a copy of all your essays! Many universities ask similar questions, so you can simply copy/paste your answers and tweak them a little to fit each university. Also, don't delete your application essays even after you receive your decisions--you'll find it helpful to have them around when writing club applications in the future. 

Good luck with your applications! I know it may seem tough right now, but it only gets better from here :)
