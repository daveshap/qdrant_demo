how to map/drape polygon layers over raster in QGIS? I want to \"map\" or \"drape\" a 2D vector (polygon) over a raster. Obtaining a 3D vector with z-values according to the raster it's draped over.Most of my internet findings point towards v.drape. However, this tool seems to only work for polylines, not polygons. Furthermore I am looking for functionality similar to that of ArcGIS 3D-Analyst (\"interpolate shape\"), where points are inserted in every new raster cell with an according height.Is there a similar tool or combination of tools to achieve this?Unfortunately, converting the polygon to polylines, draping it and converting it back to polygon does not seem to work either, as the Z-values get lost.QGIS 2.18.16
