SAILOR: Actin' funny how?
LULA: Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
LULA: One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
SAILOR: Hell, peanut...
LULA: One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen.
