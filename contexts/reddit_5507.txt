Will Hobby Lobby hire me if I smell like smoke? (16F, Illinois)
Disclaimer: I DO NOT smoke, it's my parents that smoke.

I'm 16 and really want a job, and Hobby Lobby seems right up my alley. I filled out the application and was reading through the agreement and it says at the bottom:
"We do not discriminate with regard to race, color, religion, gender, pregnancy, national origin, age, disability, or any other basis protected by state or federal law."
Does this mean that even if I'm what they want, and I get an interview and they find out I smell like smoke, that they won't hire me? I'm sure that odor is not protected, and I can't do anything about my living situation. My parents ONLY smoke inside. Even my own room smells like smoke. I can't really do anything about smelling like smoke, because even washing my clothes they still smell bad.

Is there anything I can do? Will ANY place hire me if I smell like smoke? Thank you if you read this far. :â€¢)
