PRESIDENT: Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
PRESIDENT: This is a joke in very poor taste.
ZIRA: Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
ZAIUS: Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
ZIRA: I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
ZAIUS: Do you believe him?
ZIRA: Like you, I find it difficult.
ZAIUS: But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished? You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
ZIRA: This is his assertion.
ZAIUS: Where are they now?
TAYLOR: One is in a museum!
PRESIDENT: Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
ZAIUS: How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
ZIRA: He doesn't know.
ZAIUS: Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
HONORIUS: That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
PRESIDENT: Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
TAYLOR: It's him...Landon.
ZIRA: Which one?
TAYLOR: Second from the left.
ZAIUS: Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
TAYLOR: With one of them.
ZAIUS: Identify him, then. Speak to him.
