What could the US learn from the Healthcare System in Singapore?
According to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/u-s-health-care-system-ranks-as-one-of-the-least-efficient) the US healthcare system is currently one of the least cost effective systems measured. Could any of the [Singapore systems](http://assets.ce.columbia.edu/pdf/actu/actu-singapore.pdf), ranked #2, be applied to a US healthcare system? Are any of those ideas politically tenable?
