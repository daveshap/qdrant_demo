NUKE: God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
ANNIE: Oh don't be silly. Death is nothing to be scared of. It's just another way of living. It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
NUKE: Death is like spring training?
ANNIE: Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in the eyes, Nuke-- You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
