I live in a subrural community, and can't find work
I'm a tech student, studying IT, CAP and plan to continue with AWS. I currently have 16 credits. Eventually, to continue my education I need at least a year in IT. I have decent grades and am fairly knowledgeable with what I do- including hobbies. Despite this, I can't find a job, even washing dishes. I've even come across a few scams on job hunting sites while I was looking for work over Summer.

Tech students in rural areas, how do you find work?
