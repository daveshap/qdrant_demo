Donald Trump [won every last county](http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/new-york) in New York state, except Manhattan, which he lost to John Kasich.

Why did he lose Manhattan to John Kasich? what motivating factors made Manhattan different compared to say, Bronx, which heavily went for Trump?
