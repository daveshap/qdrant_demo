Finally stopped— pet cat was the solution
I got a cat. I’m focusing on my company now and stopped trying to trade. The cat brings me so much peace of mind I’m so in love with it. However my dad hates pets and he’s trying to make me get rid of him. I’m so sad I can’t imagine losing him he sleeps on my lap while I work or lays on my desk. I love it so much
