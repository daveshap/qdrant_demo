KEVIN: Hey...
VICKY: Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
KEVIN: It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
KEVIN: About the other day...I've been thinking.
VICKY: So have I. And I know you want to make things perfect for me. And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
VICKY: And I want to make things perfect for you. You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
KEVIN: Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
VICKY: Kevin... I want to have sex with you.
KEVIN: Now?!
VICKY: No...I know the perfect time...
MICHELLE: You know, at band camp? We have dances like this. Only they're way funner. Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
JIM: Highly, highly overrated.
