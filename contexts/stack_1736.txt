Altium pin parameters in symbols thanks for the many great questions and answers over the  years.  This is my first question.I use Altium Designer for capturing designs.<br>I had an idea to make my processor components a little more flexible/readable.  With all the functions that can be held by processor pins these days, having all the functions in one name is unwieldy.  Perhaps I could put into the pin, as parameters f1 f2 ..., all the different pin functions and make them visible when needed and hide the original Display Name of the pin.  I like the idea so far but I always have to ask what dangerous beast is waiting for me down the road.  Can anyone see a drawback to this method?  I believe in the schematic a pin could be modified to show a different name/function parameter by editing the pin if needed and hide the ones not needed.Maybe someone has done this before if you have I would appreciate knowing any drawbacks to this approach.Thanks in advance
