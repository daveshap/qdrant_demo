Today is my birthday.
Today is my 16th birthday. I am all alone, i have no one to spend it with. No one even remember my birthday, no one said it either. I have been contemplating suicide and jave been looking forward to today in hopes that something would change. But nothing did. And if on mt special day nothing changes, then will anything ever really change? I decided no, and I have not made my final decision on whether or not i should follow through with whats been on my mind. I am posting this in the hopes that maybe someone will care. In the hopes that maybe someone will try to stop me, but I dont think that's what will happen. No body seems to really care about me these days. I'm just another guy on the street to everyone. This will probably get buried but oh well..

I have posted this on another subreddit. So if you see this twice that is why.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the birthday wishes!!!! I cant respond to all of you but it really has made me realize that there are grest people in thjs world.

Edit 2: im mot exaggerating when i say this, but the people in this comment section have saved my life and helped me against making a decision that I have come to realize I would regret. This is the nicest most kind group of people I have ever met, each and every one of you guys are so kind amd caring and have helped me realize that this doesnt have to be the end! Thank you all so much!!!!
