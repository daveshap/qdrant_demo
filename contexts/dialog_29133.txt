BOND: Yes -
CAPTAIN MORTON: Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
BOND: Wait a minute -
CAPTAIN MORTON: Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
SIDNEY: What's your name?
CAPTAIN MORTON: Captain Morton.
SIDNEY: My name is Sidney Winch, and -
CAPTAIN MORTON: Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
SIDNEY: I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
CAPTAIN MORTON: Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
SIDNEY: I was an attorney!
CAPTAIN MORTON: Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession. Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
SIDNEY: No.
CAPTAIN MORTON: You leave me no alternative.
