The "Conservatives vs. Liberals" opposition outside of US politics
When discussing American politics, I've seen people addressing the dichotomy of "Conservatives vs. Liberals", [treating them as opposing forces](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/head-games/201702/why-liberals-and-conservatives-think-so-differently).

However, in the country I live in (Brazil), it's not rare to see conservatives and liberals "playing for the same team": one of the presidential candidates, Jo√£o Amoedo,  said he was "[liberal na economia, conservador nos costumes](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,joao-amoedo-se-diz-liberal-na-economia-mas-conservador-nos-costumes,70002318886)", which means that he supports economic liberalism and conservative moral values. The big dichotomy here is between right and left, where both liberalism and conservatism are (usually) treated as positions in the right part of the spectrum\*, whereas the left (usually) rejects (at least one of) them.

I try coming up with analogies in order to understand, say, "which side is which" when following US politics: the liberals are the equivalent to the left and the conservatives, to the right...? My experience with my country's politics **heavily** contradicts this, as I already explained, but I try working with this view anyway.

As if it wasn't confusing enough, I then began following discussions in American leftists circles (mostly in Facebook) and I learned that most of them are strongly against not only conservatives but liberals too, as [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/magazine/hated-by-the-right-mocked-by-the-left-who-wants-to-be-liberal-anymore.html) addresses, which lead me to write this post. This position of the left makes sense when approaching the subject from the world view of my country's politics, where they're often seen as parts (not necessarily in agreement, but still) of the same side, but it doesn't make any sense when talking specifically about the US, where both are frequently seen as parts of a dichotomy.

So, I ask: Who/what exactly is this dichotomy addressing? Can it be adequately juxtaposed to a left-right dichotomy?

\*I am not implying that they always come together, (in fact, Instituto Liberal, the "Liberal Institute", published an article saying that [there is no such thing as a liberal conservative](https://www.institutoliberal.org.br/blog/nao-existe-liberal-conservador-2/) as Amoedo suggested) just that they're both seen as part of the right
