STYLES: We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
HARDY: There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
STYLES: Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
HARDY: Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
STYLES: Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
HARDY: From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
STYLES: Nevertheless --
HARDY: Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
STYLES: Not for me.
HARDY: You mean not enough to save you.
STYLES: JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
HARDY: Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
DUNBAR: That son of a bitch.
HARDY: That'd be my reaction too --
DUNBAR: He's lying.
HARDY: Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
DUNBAR: I'm serious --
HARDY: Fuck you're serious"
DUNBAR: Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
OSBORNE: He said he worked there --
DUNBAR: No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
OSBORNE: What business?
DUNBAR: Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
HARDY: So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
DUNBAR: I didn't shoot West --
HARDY: Yeah, we know, Pike did.
