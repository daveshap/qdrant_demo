Do Mayors and County Boards Have the Authority to Pass and Enforce Business Closures and Mask Mandates? What Limits Exist for What Can be Instituted at a Hyper-local Level?
As different parts of the country respond to COVID in their own unique way, many cities/counties have remained shut down or instituted mask mandates. I understand from another thread posted to this sub that states governors are expressly given the power to respond to public health crises as they see fit if the federal government has not instituted any sweeping measures.

Is this same power given to local governments in the absence of state-wide measures? Are there any legal parameters on what they are able to legislate/enforce, or is anything allowed so long as it doesn't violate federal/state constitutions?

Edit: Feeling the need to clarify that I am aware that the data is utterly unambiguous that masks are effective, and that mandating them seems a small matter when stacked up next to other temporary emergency measures like Japanese internment, WWII food rations, the PATRIOT act, etc. Yet these are almost always enacted at a state or federal level, not city or county, so I'm especially curious what systems are in place for endowing power to local government when more centralized government doesn't act, or conversely what limits are in place for such situations.
