MR. WHITE: Want a smoke?
MR. PINK: Why not?
MR. WHITE: Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
MR. PINK: That's not correct.
MR. WHITE: What's wrong with it?
MR. PINK: The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
MR. WHITE: As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
MR. PINK: I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
MR. WHITE: Look, enough of this Mr White" shit -"
MR. PINK: Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
MR. WHITE: You're right, this is bad. How did you get out?
MR. PINK: Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
