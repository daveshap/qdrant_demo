BOND: Where’s M?
ELEKTRA: Soon she’ll be everywhere.
BOND: All this, because you fell for Renard?
ELEKTRA: Five more turns and your neck will break.
ELEKTRA: Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
BOND: You turned Renard.
ELEKTRA: Just like you...only you were even easier.
