TORQUIL: What kind of friend do you think I am?
COLWYN: The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.

COLWYN: Go. I command you.
TORQUIL: Yes, my lord.
ERGO: Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
COLWYN: You and I will guard the fire.
ERGO: What else is left for a man without friends.
