List of All Privileges Table on MySQL I\u2019m trying to connect MySQL to an identity management (IDM) platform - goal is, to be able to create roles from the IDM site out of the MySQL privileges and be able to provision it to new users, which should create as well in the MySQL. To do this, I need to connect MySQL to the IDM platform, which I have already done. I\u2019m stuck on the next step though: I need the list of all privileges that can be granted to a user in MySQL then map it as entitlements on the IDM site. I have checked the information_schema.user_privileges/mysql.user but found that it only contains the current privileges of existing users. The privileges were on columns, I think if there is a way I can get it as records then I may consider using it. Can anyone please help? Or if someone knows any methodology to do this better please let me know.
