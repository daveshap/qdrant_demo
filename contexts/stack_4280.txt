Life in permanent shadow I've been experimenting with a fantasy world that is flat, with the sun fixed in place over the centre. The day-night cycle is provided by the sun dimming and then brightening again. Most of the rest of things are assumed to be 'as on Earth'.The lack of sun motion, though, creates an environment that doesn't exist on Earth\u2014large areas in permanent shadow, due to being behind hills and mountains. These places receive no direct sunlight\u2014their main source of light is atmospheric glow\u2014but they do receive a fair amount of light, and do experience a day-night cycle.How would (macroscopic) life - plants especially, but other organisms as well - adapt to an environment like this?
