Multiple recruiting firms, same job?
Last week, I got contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, for the first time, out of the blue. I wasn't looking for a position, but the job sounds like a great opportunity. It's in the medical technology field, and I'm currently in academia. I'd been planning on going to graduate school (PhD) and likely continuing on the track to become a professor, just because it was a clear path in my field of research. However, with this job I would probably not need to get an advanced degree unless I decided to later. The lower end of the salary range is a 20k pay bump from what I'm making now, too, and there are a lot of opportunities for growth.

I noticed, however, that the same job was posted by another recruiting company... The company that contacted me does not have the job posted, and they're in a different country, but it looks legit from what I can tell. The company the job is for is based in a different country as well, but they have locations in the US. Is it common for a company to use two different recruiters for the same job? 

The recruiter I spoke with said he'd pass along my resume and that I should hear from the hiring manager next week.
