BELLMAN: Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
RICKY: Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
BELLMAN: Yes, sir.
RICKY: Is it a good room?
BELLMAN: I can take you down there.
RICKY: Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
BELLMAN: Not on me, sir.
RICKY: Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
BELLMAN: Are you sure?
RICKY: Yeah. Take it.
BELLMAN: Thank you very much, sir.
RICKY: So?
BELLMAN: What, sir?
RICKY: Is it the good room?
BELLMAN: All the suites are about the same.
RICKY: Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
BELLMAN: Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
RICKY: What if I gave you forty?
BELLMAN: It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
RICKY: No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
BELLMAN: Thank you, sir.
RICKY: Where's the place to go tonight?
BELLMAN: As far as...?
RICKY: Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
BELLMAN: Women?
RICKY: Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
BELLMAN: I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
RICKY: Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
BELLMAN: It's on West Broadway.
RICKY: See you later.
