How to segment test data based on clustering run on training data- UNSUPERVISED How can I segment the 'test' datasets based on k-means used in training datasets in R. For example, I run k-means clustering in R and get 7 segments from demographic and psychographic attributes of the customer in one state. Assigned the name to all the 7 segments based on the attributes present in each cluster. Now I want to segment other state data into the same 7 segments using previously run clustering on one state data? How to do this in R? Is it possible? Please do not confuse with supervised learning(Classification problem). My query is for unsupervised.
