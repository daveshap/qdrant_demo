WESSEX: You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
VIOLA: It is not my riding day, my lord.
WESSEX: Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
VIOLA: I am going to church.
WESSEX: I understand of course. It is to be expected.
VIOLA: It is to be expected on a Sunday.
WESSEX: And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
VIOLA: Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
WESSEX: Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
VIOLA: He is dead?
WESSEX: Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
