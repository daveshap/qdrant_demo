How do I craft a resume to avoid age/sex-discrimination ?
We all know its there. 

If I get a foot in the door and an interview I can at least impress with my abilities. I know there is no way to stop from being not offered a position because of team "fit".   Being a dumpy middle aged woman with kids ...unless I kill it in the interview I know I am not getting that position.

But I would at least like a shot at proving myself. 

I have never attended an interview, where I haven't been offered a position *till last year. It was a bit of a shock to my system, since the guy that ultimately got the position was less experienced, educated and could have tried to be a better engineer. So I don't know why he was picked.*
