Got an interview for an Account Executive position with 0 experience, any advice?
Got a phone call from an employer I had submitted an application to on a long shot. With no experience in this field and having done no real interviews aside from factory/labor type jobs, I was wondering if you guys and gals had any advice on how to pocket this interview? Maybe areas of study on how to over perform a job like this as well would be nice as well.
