JOANNA: Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me. It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
TED: So we've got problems. Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
JOANNA: Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
TED: I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening. My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
JOANNA: You just don't get it, do you? I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
TED: I heard you, Joanna. I promise I heard you.
JOANNA: No you didn't. You didn't even ask about Billy.
TED: What about Billy?
JOANNA: I'm not taking him with me.
TED: What?
JOANNA: Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
TED: C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that. You're a terrific mother--
JOANNA: I am not! I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother. I yell at him all the time. I have no patience. No...No. He's better off without me. Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
TED: Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
JOANNA: NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now... I'll go right out the window.
TED: Where are you going?
JOANNA: I don't know...
