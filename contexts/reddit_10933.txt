Update:I told my mom
If you look on my profile you’ll see my post earlier on this sub about being suicidal. It finally overpowered me and I told my mom. She told me that she loves me and that I’m gonna be happy again. We might go to a therapist soon. 
I’m also still talking to that girl and we’re both getting closer and dealing with this fucked up world together. Thanks so much for your advice guys, you saved my fucking life. I love you guys and I’m trying to love life again.
