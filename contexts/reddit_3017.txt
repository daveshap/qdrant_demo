How do you deal with superior who hates you?
My boss’s boss’s boss (VP of Sales and Marketing) hates me. I haven’t done anything unreasonable to affect him in a negative way for two years. I’m a sales rep and 99% of what I do is work on making sales and occasionally I will voice my opinion to my direct superior, the sales manager. For the most part I keep to myself. Two years ago I discovered a flaw in my boss’s boss’s boss’s plan for the company in opening physical retail stores and I told my boss. He directed the info to the CFO of the company and he saw the mistake. The VP thinks I tried to sabotage his idea and that’s why he hates me. He has been negatively affecting my work life every so often and I’m just wondering what precautions I could take.
