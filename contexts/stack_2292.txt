FFA: Does Zenyatta's Orb of Discord affect damage done by other enemies? So in free for all, it's everyone against everyone (duh). Since everyone is technically an enemy to each other, how does Zenyatta's Orb of Discord work? Does it only enhance the damage he himself does on his discord target or does it enhance the damage of all players on the discord target?
