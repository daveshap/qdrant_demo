ULLMAN: Good morning Jack. I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
JACK: No problem. In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
ULLMAN: Good. Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen. Is your family having a look around?
JACK: No, my son's discovered the games room.
ULLMAN: Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
JACK: Right there.
ULLMAN: Oh fine. Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
ULLMAN: Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
WATSON: Fine.
JACK: I'd better collect my family first.
ULLMAN: Oh...
ULLMAN: This is our Colorado Lounge.
WENDY: Oh, it's beautiful. My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
JACK: Sure is.
WENDY: God, I've never seen anything like this before. Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
ULLMAN: Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
WENDY: Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
