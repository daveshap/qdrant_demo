Stop clenching your teeth
Someone once posted this and it hit home with me immediately. With the holidays coming and the weather turning, there's lots to stress about. You only get one set of teeth, and nobody needs a headache on top.

It'll be ok. You're beyond worthy - you're incredible! We're lucky to have you.
