PORTER: Good evening, Miss.
BETTY: How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
PORTER: I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
BETTY: How long would that take?
PORTER: Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
BETTY: Immigration Officer?
PORTER: Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry. Otherwise they might think...
BETTY: They might think I was running away from something.
PORTER: Possibly, Miss.
