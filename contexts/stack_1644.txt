Do I need a relay for my LED bars? I installed two 4\" 18 watt LED light bars on my ATV. It is currently wired to the factory switch on the ATV handlebars and there is no relay being used. I have had to replace the right LED bar twice because it has died on me. Is this because I didn't use a relay? Will the relay help? As a side note, the battery seems to be failing and not holding a charge well (old battery). When I start the ATV (can't use electric start, pull only), the lights will turn on but they will start to dim unless I rev the engine. The ATV is a 1995 Polaris Magnum 425 4x4.
