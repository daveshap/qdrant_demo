What is the Vegan home planet in 'Cities in Flight'? In James Blish's Cities in Flight tetraology there are mentions of the war between Earth colonists and the Vegan Confederation that ruled half the galaxy.  Naturally the Vegans come from Vega, or Alpha Lyrae.But I forget if the Vegan home world is described as Vega II (Vega Two), or as Vega 11 (Vega Eleven).Does anyone know which Vegan planet was the home world of the Vegans?
