Dismissed misdemeanor on background check?
An incident occurred a few years ago and I got cited on two charges by the police, no arrest. I was stupid and young, it was something relatively small. I showed up in court where they agreed on me to do a diversion program where my charges would be dismissed at the end of the period. 

I was wondering, does a dismissed misdemeanor show up on background checks and if it does, what happens with the employer? Will they give you a chance to explain the situation and perhaps give me a chance at the job or will they reject me upright? I've never applied to a full-time job and haven't been through extensive background checks.

I finished college a year ago and am now looking for full time jobs relating to my degree and thus going through the process of background checks once I get offers. I haven't yet had the case expunged as it is a lengthy process and will try to get it expunged asap but would like to know if anyone knows how a dismissed misdemeanor will affect my chances getting hired right now.

I've searched on Google and most of the cases have arrests being made, but in my case I wasn't arrested, just confronted by police and given a citation.
