I’m walking on eggshells, but unhappy with my home life (See text box)
TLDR=Mental state bad, mom’s house=anxiety, dad house=better.   Mom=Scary.  Me=eggshell walking.   Want leave, could end up fucked, Help.


My parents’ divorce has been a pretty dramatic thing, and the tension is still loud and clear. Because of my secluded childhood I am horrible at just talking to people, and with an anxiety disorder on top of that my daily social life is very difficult. My mom, who is very emotional and pretty delusional, has sole custody of me, while my dad has visitation rights. 

So I have two houses in two separate towns. My dad is a really chill and understanding guy, and his girlfriend and my step-siblings have made it a very wonderful place to be.  Whereas in the town my mom lives in, I find myself constantly struggling to get footing, the slightest validation, and dignity. 

Mentally, I’m always the most healthy with my dad. I can’t even remember the last time I stressed out up there. But my Mom has a very over dramatic and horrifying story of what happened back then, and if I say anything about it then she has a lot of trap cards to pull. Everything I do, I have to be careful or else I’m fucked.  If my dad were to try and get custody... my Mom has a story to hold over him. There’s no doubt she’d take him to court or something and get him in trouble. Her version of what happened is very different from what actually happened... we all know that she’d get the upper hand being a woman. 

I’m not even sure if it’s worth mentioning... but I’m growing more and more depressed and I don’t think being here helps my anxiety any. What can I do?
