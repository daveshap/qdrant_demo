TRAVIS: Why should it be grounded?
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT: Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
TRAVIS: Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT: The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
TRAVIS: Have you tried the telephone?
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT: There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
TRAVIS: No.
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT: Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here. Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
