COLONEL: My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
GENERAL MANN: That's because we want a chance to observe them. This is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them. What happens here will be a guide to all other operations. The minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops, I'll get my report to Washington. You've deployed your forces well.
COLONEL: Thank you, sir. If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
GENERAL MANN: They'll probably move at dawn.
