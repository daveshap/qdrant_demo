I finally kissed him
I met this guy (22) during the winter at my (22f) part-time job that I've worked at over breaks ever since I was 16. I come back when I'm home from college. We started hanging out more and I told him I liked him, which he replied that he did too. We went on 2 dates, but we are both really shy, so we just held hands. Today after work, my best friend (who works at the same part-time job as me) made a small graduation celebration today at the park since I graduated via email at 10am this morning haha. After eating and playing games, we went our separate ways except for the guy and me. We stood outside in the cold for what must have been 20 or 30 minutes just making stupid jokes. He made sure my car started since it wouldn't start when I left work before. He stood at my door and I made a small stupid joke about me being short. Then I said "if I weren't so short I would try to kiss you." Then he kissed me.

I've gone on dates before, but have never liked a guy the way I like this one. I was never the one who tried to kiss first since I'm so shy, but I could tell we both wanted to and he's too polite to make sudden moves which is another thing I really like about him. The guys I've dated before were huge jerks and did not respect my boundaries like he does. I've wanted to kiss him for a while and it finally happened. This was the best graduation day.
