SAMI: Hadley --
DANIEL: Has to be.
JULIEN: This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
SAMI: Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
JULIEN: Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I? I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
SAMI: We've got to get out of here.
JULIEN: That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
SAMI: You're not helping.
RAYMOND: Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
