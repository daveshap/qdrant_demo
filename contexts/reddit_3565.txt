Some thoughts for guys on dating apps
In light of the recent Match Group scandal, I think it's time for me to write up some guidelines for guys using dating apps. If you haven't heard, Match Group is an online dating company that owns just about every dating app you have ever heard of. They were accused by the FTC for creating fake profiles to entice users to purchase premium subscriptions. 

Here are some of my thoughts:

* If you've never had a girlfriend or had a woman show interest in you in real life, then forget about dating apps. I have never seen a guy with no success in real life with tons of matches on these apps unless he's catfishing hard. And if you're in a remote area without lots of people to meet IRL, then the apps won't work either because there won't be anyone on there. 

* Never, ever pay for these subscriptions or boosts or whatever they're called unless you already have tons of matches without purchasing them. These things almost NEVER work because the root of the problem is that you're not competitive enough (not attractive enough, not educated enough, not unique enough, etc.). Even if more people see your profile, you will just get more left swipes or get likes from people you wouldn't swipe right on anyways. 

* You need to understand the dating app business model. The longer they keep you on their platform, the higher the probability of you spending money, so it is NOT in their interest to actually match you with suitable people. When you have few matches or low quality matches, you get desperate, and every new match will give you a dopamine boost. They're capitalizing on that addiction. 

* You need to understand the vicious cycle of dating apps for men and women. Men swipe right on everything because they have low numbers of matches and want to maximize their chances. Women become more selective because they now have more choices, which leads to less matches for guys. And the circle goes round and round. Oh, and you also get penalized for swiping right on everyone. 

* Because women have lots of matches from the hordes of thirsty guys, they can leverage their position on these apps to seek validation, find someone to chat with, advertise their Instagram/Snapchat, or sell sex work. I think there was a survey that said the vast majority of women are NOT looking to date seriously on these apps, and they're just curious or bored. 

* For the love of God, don't turn into an incel just because you don't get matches online. I mean, you should never be an incel no matter what, but I see so many guys completely giving up on dating and blaming women because little Timmy only got three matches on his first day on Tinder. Seriously, for all the reasons I've listed above, these apps are NOT a true measure of your attractiveness because on these apps, only the most attractive men are perceived as attractive while guys below that super high threshold is perceived as unattractive. It's essentially a binary view of attractiveness, but attractiveness is more of a bell curve. 

* Dating apps promote convenience, but do they really? Sure, it takes no effort to swipe right on someone, but let's be rational here: what's the conversion rate from a swipe to a date? After the swipe, you have to match, you have to talk, you have to set up a date, and you have to actually go to the date. There can be tons of drop off at any point in that funnel, so when you consider all the effort you spent for that date, are you really better off than just asking in person? And you might say, "well I'm an introvert and prefer online dating", but that's not the right excuse. Being an introvert means you don't like to hang around people all the time and talk, but that doesn't mean you can't be confident and ask in real life. 

* A lot of guys turn to dating apps because they don't have many friends or a social circle but still want to date. Thus, the apps seem like their best option, but you need to ask yourself, "Why don't you have lots of friends?" Are you really busy? If so, how is dating gonna work? Are you really shy? If so, how is dating gonna work? Are you really unlikable? If so, how is dating gonna work? Or let's talk about the best case scenario where you're a great guy, but you just moved to a new city and don't know anyone. In that case, you certainly should NOT prioritize dating over making friends because if you guys break up, then your social life is back to square one. 

What am I getting at here? Well, here's a metaphor: gambling is fun once in a while, but if you want to make a living, you probably shouldn't stay in the casino. These dating apps are essentially casinos where all the odds are against you and the chances of your success are as good as Jackie Chan not doing kung fu in a movie. I mean, there is now PHYSICAL proof that these companies are trying their best to screw your wallet, and even if they do remove the fake profiles, that's not going to help you one bit because the ecosystem on these apps is already fucked with hundreds of guys vying for one girl's attention, deluding her into thinking she looks like Arwen from LotR while deluding you into thinking you look like Gollum. Personally, I think these apps have done more harm than good on the dating world because they focused on the monetization of desperation rather than building a good product, and I would love to see them all destroyed in the fires of Mt. Doom. Middle Earth references aside, if you've used these apps for the last three months without achieving a single meet-up, then these apps are not for you.

Edit: It looks like a lot of people are asking for an alternative, so I'll provide some feedback here. 

* You need to ask people in real life. I think many guys are afraid of rejection or being called a "creep", and so they retreat to apps. When you start asking people out in real life, you may crash and burn, quite painfully, but if the apps aren't working out for you at all and you want a relationship, you need to try something else. To ask someone out in real life, it's probably easiest at a bar/club if you see someone giving you signs such as holding eye contact or smiling. Just strike up a conversation with her and feel her out as a person. If she seems like a cool person, then just ask her for her number. If she gives it to you, great. If she doesn't, say something playful and just leave her alone. Obviously, don't ask a woman if she's not giving you any signs at all. That rarely ends well. 

* Make female friends. Make female friends of your friends. Make female friends at your hobbies. Make female friends in general. You don't have to be attracted to them, but it never hurts to have a network that isn't a sausage fest. Women have women friends, and you bet some of them are single. You can ask your female friends to introduce you to their single friends, or they might even set you guys up without you even asking.

* Here's what I think about being called a creep. Women on Reddit love calling men creepy for approaching them, and this has led many guys to believe that they should never even talk to women. WRONG. Let me paint you a scenario that's actually creepy: a woman is talking with her friends and not minding anyone else, and you somehow shove yourself between her and her friends and say to her "hey gorgeous, I've been looking at you all night", and when she asks you to please leave her alone, you ignore that and just keep following her around. Yea, that's fucking creepy. If you can't see that, God help you. Most guys here ARE NOT like that. Most guys here are just a bit shy, a bit awkward, a bit inexperienced, and a bit insecure. I'm sure most of you would never do something like that. If you say "hi" to a woman and she immediately says "ew creep", that's not on you, that's on her. She's a crass and immature woman with no manners and not worth your time. There's probably a lot of women on Reddit that had poor experiences with being approached by men, either being harassed, stalked, groped, or whatever, so now they believe all men are like that. Don't let them poison your mind. I used to think that Reddit was right and that I should never approach women, but deep in my heart, I knew it was not true that no woman liked to be approached. I only used that as an excuse so that I would never have to approach someone and potentially get rejected. I mean, just ask yourself: for all the single women not on dating apps, how are they supposed to find relationships if no one ever approaches them? We still live in a society where men are expected to approach women rather than the other way around, so to conclude, approaching women is very, very normal.

* I want to thank /u/[Bacon_Square] for this one that I've completely forgotten: go somewhere where you shine. What does this mean? If you're good at sports, go play sports. If you're really funny or musically talented, perform at a show. If you're really smart and successful, go to conferences and give speeches. If you're passionate about anything, SHOW IT OFF. On a dating app, the only thing that separates you from the other guy is typically just your pictures. To a much less extent, your bio. For many people, they cannot really show their strengths in a 2D profile. Some of my bosses are the smartest and most successful guys I have ever met, but if they made a dating profile, I guarantee you they wouldn't get more than 5 matches. Why? Because they can't show off their strongest traits when the comparison criteria is pictures and attractiveness. You need to play to your strengths, and if apps are not bringing out the best in you, then you need to find that outlet. Why do a lot of people like celebrities? Because we all admire someone who stands at the peak of society (also because gold diggers). I'm not saying you have to be a celebrity to find a girlfriend, but do you see how making yourself stand out is really attractive? Not to mention you'll meet people similar to you at places where you frequent.
