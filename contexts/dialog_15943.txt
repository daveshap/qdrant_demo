MATHILDA: OK, I'm fine.
LEON: Good.
LEON: Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
MATHILDA: Huh... 500 meters?
LEON: 130... 140...
MATHILDA: How can you say it?
LEON: Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters. When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot. Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss. A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5. You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
MATHILDA: What, for example?
LEON: Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
MATHILDA: What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
LEON: Rocket launcher.
MATHILDA: Oh really? But can you miss the car?
MATHILDA: Wow! It's brilliant!
LEON: Yeah... Come on, have a little training.
MATHILDA: Who'll I aim at?
LEON: Whoever.
