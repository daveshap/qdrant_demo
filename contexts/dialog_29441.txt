ROBERT: You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
SALAZAR: Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year. But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force. We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
ROBERT: Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
SALAZAR: Yes, I hope so as well.
ROBERT: Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand? What is your policy for treating addiction?
SALAZAR: Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
RUIZ: This is ridiculous. Why is there no elevator?
GORDON: When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
