VARIO: I warned you a million times.
HENRY: I've been all fucked up since I got out.
VARIO: You think I didn't know what you were doing?
HENRY: It was easy money. I did it in the can. Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
VARIO: Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
HENRY: But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me. I was fucking crazy. But I'm okay now. I can be trusted. I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
VARIO: You thought I was some fucking jerk?
HENRY: Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit. I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
HENRY: Paulie. You're all I got. I need help.
VARIO: You treated me like shit.
VARIO: Here. Take it. Now I gotta turn my back on you.
HENRY: Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
