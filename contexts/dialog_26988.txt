ELIZABETH: We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
NICHOLAS: You're going? Well, thanks again. Good to see you, Rachel... Thanks for coming, Mel. I'll get your car back. Right now it's, uh... at the zoo. Sorry.
ELIZABETH: Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
NICHOLAS: I'll call. I really will.
ELIZABETH: I know.
