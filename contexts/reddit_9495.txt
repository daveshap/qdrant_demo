I paid off my 0% APR Balance Transfer in time on one card, and then got my other card onto a lower-interest loan, and for the first time, I'm SOLVENT!
The 0% I'm usually pretty good at paying the right amount each month to have it disappear by the end, but this time I had to let it slip - but, by the end of December, I was able to pull some strings and get it paid off.

Then, just now, I was able to take out a loan to pay my other card in full, at about half the interest! <700 credit due to balances, but I've never once missed a payment on anything, so that's nice.

And, for the first time in my adult life, I actually made more money than I had to spend, and I'm on track to have it continue! Call me Acetone cuz I'm Solvent baby!

Now just over $150k in debt left (including my student loans, and a nice house I bought because the mortgage was way less than rent, and my parents helped with the deposit), and I'm debt-free!
