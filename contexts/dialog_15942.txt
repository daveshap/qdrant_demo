LILI: What's the matter?
JACK: Ouch! Something's biting me.
LILI: Biting you?
JACK: Pinching me!
LILI: Pinching? Where?
JACK: Everywhere! Ow!
LILI: I can't see a thing.
JACK: Nor can I. Damn! It's buzzing all around me. Ouch! I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
LILI: Oona? Do you suppose it's a faerie?
JACK: Ow! Whatever it is, it hurts.
