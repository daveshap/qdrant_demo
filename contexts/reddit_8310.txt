Neil Gorsuch nomination megathread
We've had a number of submissions about this and decided to do a megathread concering the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

[Here](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/us/politics/supreme-court-nominee-trump.html?action=Click&contentCollection=BreakingNews&contentID=64863353&pgtype=Homepage) is a news article about the announcement.

[Here](http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/01/judge-neil-gorsuch-colorado-native-washington-d-c-insider/) is a profile of Judge Gorsuch from SCOTUSblog.

Some start off questions:

* What are some key cases that Judge Gorsuch authored?

* Does Judge Gorsuch have a record of being upheld or overturned as a district judge or circuit judge as compared to his peers?

* Have Senate Democrats indicated a desire to filibuster his nomination?
