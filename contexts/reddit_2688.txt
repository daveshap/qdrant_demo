Should I make a LinkedIn post about my acceptance into a big city gallery (&link to it)... even if my work in it is technically NSFW?
Looking for advice on a potential LinkedIn post

I’m trying to post more on LinkedIn. Recently, my photography work got accepted into a gallery in a big city in my state—a big deal for me. Because of the current COVID-19 situation, the gallery ended up being online. I wanted to make a post on LinkedIn about it, but the catch is that my photo is technically NSFW (you can see a very very small portion of an areola in it of my female model). There are other photos in the gallery that are also technically NSFW, but it’s kind of the nature of the beast aka it happens in art a lot. Neither my photo nor the other ones I have seen are sexual in nature. 
I’ve shown my boss and my coworker the photo and they thought it was amazing, they weren’t offended by it. But then again, for context, photography is my hobby, it’s also not directly my day job. I’m a tech writer, and I sometimes photograph products, but that’s it when it comes to my pro photography work. On the flip side, I was in a previous gallery before for my photography work, and that previous gallery I did post about on LinkedIn. 

Anyways, should I post about this on LinkedIn with the link to the gallery? Or do I skip this one out and just reference that I was featured in it on my page somewhere.
