Getting sent home at a new job
So I was hired 3 weeks ago to work a job which is considered essential so we are not closing and have been working through all of this, however I started having symptoms of runny nose, cough, green mucus. My job is very physical and I’ve been feeling like sick going slow, getting dizzy, my coworker suggest that I tell the supervisor which I did and was sent home. I told him I felt that I was okay to work that I just felt a little unwell and i didn’t want to loose my job. He said it was just protocol and that I was fine that they would send me to the dr should I be worried? I feel like I shouldn’t have said anything now I’m young and this is a great job opportunity that I feel like a screwed up. I don’t know If this is the right subreddit for this but I didn’t know where else to post. Any info would greatly appreciated thanks.
