Problem with mods on Morrowind I've been playing Elder Scrolls Oblivion for almost three years and I love it. I got Morrowind Game of the Year Edition last year and I started to play it. I like mods, so I downloaded lots of them to make the game a little bit funny. But when I start the game, some mods don't work. I have no idea why this happens, I even checked on the Construction Set and I can see the new NPC's and objects, but they never show up in the game. For example, I downloaded a couple of house mods and they work fine(Cave House, Warrior's Rest). I have a mod for massive teleportation, and also works. But I downloaded new quest mods(Regin of fire, The great tribe of the North, Romance, The ring of the vampire, A drow history) but they don't work. Can anyone help me, please? I really love to play this quest mods, I have lots of them for Oblivion.
