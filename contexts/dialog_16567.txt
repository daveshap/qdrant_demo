CONWAY: By the way, what religion do you follow here?
CHANG: We follow many.
CHANG: To put it simply, I should say that our general belief was in moderation. We preach the virtue of avoiding excesses of every kind, even including— —the excess of virtue itself.
CONWAY: That's intelligent.
CHANG: We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
CONWAY: How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
CHANG: Oh, good heavens, no!
CONWAY: How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
CHANG: Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal? Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
CONWAY: You have no disputes over women?
CHANG: Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
CONWAY: Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
CHANG: Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
CONWAY: That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
CHANG: You'd be surprised, my dear Conway, how a little courtesy all around helps to smooth out the most complicated problems.
