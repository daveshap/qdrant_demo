ELIZABETH: I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
NORRINGTON: Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
SWANN: Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
NORRINGTON: My apologies, Governor.
ELIZABETH: Actually, I find it all fascinating.
SWANN: And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
ELIZABETH: Yes, father.
