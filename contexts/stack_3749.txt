Detect visual attention area in an image I'm trying to detect the visual attention area in a given image and crop the image into that area. For instance, given an image of any size and a rectangle of say LxW dimension as an input, I would like to crop the image to the most important visual attention area. I'm looking for a state of the art approach for that.Do we have any tools or SDK to implement that? Any piece of code or algorithm would really help.
