Sometimes I feel the only reason I don't end it all
is because I would break my father's heart. That is the only reason. He has invested so much in me, time money and energy, I would feel like he would feel like he failed, and I feel ungrateful just saying it. I make no difference in nobody else's life, I've always been a super lonely person. That's the only thing that keeps me here :(.
