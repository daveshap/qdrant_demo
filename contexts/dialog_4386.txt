BONES: What else? Money.
MACK: It ain't the money - it's the high. The big fat floating 'what if?' And it's way more profitable. Nobody ever wins. So you never have to pay out.
BONES: But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
MACK: Yeah, but I ain't talking horse. I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
BONES: Those 'fools' are my people.
MACK: Ain't no big thang. It's just a po' man's free base. Here, check it out.
BONES: I ain't interested. And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
MACK: Just try it.
BONES: I said, no thanks.
MACK: Go on. It won't kill you.
