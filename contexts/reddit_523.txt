I (31F) am going to tell my sweet, although very socially awkward coworker that his body odor requires him to wear deodorant tomorrow, how can I soften the embarrassment for him?
As the title says any advice would be welcome, I have no intention of wording it to him like this. I’m not sure what I’m going to say actually, I could probably go to my manager about it but I know I’m closer to him then most and I feel it would be better coming from me. He’s been homeschooled his entire life and from what he’s told me I have an incredibly strong feeling his parents have simply never gone over the importance of personal hygiene. 
So what can I say or at least how might I initiate this conversation?
