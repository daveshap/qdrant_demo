Citizens assemblies are randomly sampled groups of citizens that deliberate on issues and are thought of as an alternative to representative democracy. What does the research say about their efficacy?
[Citizen assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) are deliberative bodies formed using [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition) or random selection. The typical assembly focuses on a single topic where:

1. There is a "Learning Phase" where academics educate the assembly on the topic at hand.
2. There is an "Open Forum Phase" where members of the public, interest groups, and politicians submit comments on the topic at hand.
3. There is a "Discussion Phase" where the assembly deliberates with each other over the merits and demerits of proposals
4. There is a "Decision Phase" where members vote in favor or against the proposals. 

There has been a lot written about citizens assemblies over the years.
