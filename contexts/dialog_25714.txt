CARL: You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
JOHNNY: Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
CARL: Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
JOHNNY: The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
CARL: I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
JOHNNY: I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
