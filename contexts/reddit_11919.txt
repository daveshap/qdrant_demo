I don't know what to do now
I'm going to keep this brief, but I could expand if needed.

I flunked out of university last year spring semester, got into a technical college thing and I'm doing shitty with my grades again.  I don't really have a good reason and I'm mostly here to rant.  I believe I could get away with just being on academic probation instead of suspension like last time, but I can't even imagine what it would be like disappointing my parents again.  I don't think I can live with that feeling.

Maybe I should have posted this to /r/rant or something.  If there is a more appropriate sub I will go there.

e: in retrospect, I never knew what to do so the now in the title is irrelevant.  I've spent my entire life not having a clue what to make a career out of, and now there isn't anything I have a passion for to want to do for the rest of my life or even just a decent amount of it.  I know a lot of this is just part of growing up, but I suck at that and school is something I do because I don't know what else I would do.

feel free to ask anything for clarification or anything in general
