BAIN: Five million dollars?
RATH: That's right.
BAIN: Shit. That sure is a lot of money.
RATH: Did you see how I did that? Magic wasn't it?
BAIN: What?
RATH: You understand what's going on? It makes sense, right?
BAIN: Oh, yeah.
RATH: What I just said, no assassin would say. What I've said, only a mark would say.
BAIN: You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
RATH: You would be.
BAIN: You don't know a fucking thing about me. You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
RATH: Why don't you tell me.
BAIN: I'll tell you this. After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive. But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
RATH: Now I'll tell you something. It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
