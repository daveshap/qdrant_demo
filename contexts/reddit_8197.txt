Who is Stephen Bannon and why is he accused of racism?
I've never heard of this guy before, but lots of claims of racism are being made against him all over the media. But, it also seems the media is quick to play this card, even when it isn't necessarily justified. So what's the story? Why are people claiming Bannon is racist?

EDIT: Sources noting Bannon's racism accusations:
