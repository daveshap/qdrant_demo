EDDIE: It was my decision, not his.
DUFFY: Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
EDDIE: Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference. How about that? The case is all yours.
DUFFY: Oh yeah...? Alright.
EDDIE: I'm ready to be briefed. Excuse us.
DUFFY: Yeah, sure. Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
