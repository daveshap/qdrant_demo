What is the difference between Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation and Condon approximation Both Born-Oppenheimer approximation and Condon approximation kind of refer to the separation of electronic and nuclear wave function. I'm confused what exactly is their difference.Do we need to use BOA when we derive Franck-Condon factor or dipole correlation function with Fermi's Golden Rule by default?
