ELAINE: Sounds like Beverly Hills.
WILSON: Here, are you always this sarky?
ELAINE: Sarcastic, moi? Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in. It's expected any day now. I'm all packed and ready to go.
WILSON: Weren't you on a television series?
ELAINE: If it played in England somebody owes me money. Who told you that -- Eddie?
WILSON: Said it went on for donkey's years.
ELAINE: Three seasons. They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail. I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
WILSON: Oh, it just ended, then.
ELAINE: Now who's being sarcastic?
WILSON: When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
ELAINE: I'm sorry. I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went. It must've been the bars.
