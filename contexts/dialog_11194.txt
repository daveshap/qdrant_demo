RAYMOND: I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
NICK: Sure.
RAYMOND: It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
NICK: Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
RAYMOND: Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
JEAN-CLAUDE: They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
RAYMOND: That is when we will go in.
