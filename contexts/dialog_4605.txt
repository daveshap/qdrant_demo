CAESAR: Shut up, Violet!
VIOLET: He can't kill you --
CAESAR: Violet!
VIOLET: Not until he has the money!

CORKY: Lick me.
CAESAR: Where is it?
CORKY: Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
CAESAR: Stupid cunt!

CAESAR: Don't try to tell me what to do.
VIOLET: You need the money just like we do.
CAESAR: Shut up, Violet.
VIOLET: Let us go and we'll make a deal.
