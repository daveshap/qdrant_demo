ETHAN: An idea, yeah.
SWANBECK: Like?
ETHAN: Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry. And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier. So let's get on with it. He's still in Sydney?
SWANBECK: Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead. So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier. We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
ETHAN: If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
SWANBECK: You were there.
SWANBECK: When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you. Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what? Two, three times?
ETHAN: Twice.
SWANBECK: What did you think of him?
ETHAN: You know we had reservations about each other. Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
SWANBECK: Not necessarily.
