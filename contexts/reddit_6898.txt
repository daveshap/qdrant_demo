My new current job was just posted again on LinkedIn. Should I be worried?
I just started a new job (2 weeks ago) and I noticed that yesterday it was reposted on LinkedIn. No one has told me if they have any issues with me so Iâ€™m confused. Has this happened to anyone else and it ended up being nothing?
