ST. LUC: Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now. What's your number? The number of your apartment?
MR. SPERGAZZI: We live in 703.
ST. LUC: OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
FORSYTHE: But where are you going?
ST. LUC: Down to the incinerator.
