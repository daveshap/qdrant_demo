FERNANDO: I want to go with you!
COLUMBUS: There'll be a time.
FERNANDO: You promise? Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
FERNANDO: Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
COLUMBUS: Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
MARCHENA: In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
COLUMBUS: Forgive me, Father. For I have sinned.
MARCHENA: I am listening, my son.
COLUMBUS: Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men. And I betrayed you.
MARCHENA: What are you saying?
COLUMBUS: I lied. The journey will be longer than I said.
MARCHENA: How long?
COLUMBUS: I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
MARCHENA: May God forgive you...! You must tell them! You must tell your men!
COLUMBUS: If I tell them, they won't follow me. You know that I am right, Father. You trust me...
MARCHENA: My son, my son... Your certitudes are sometimes frightening... Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
COLUMBUS: You are bound by an oath, Father.
MARCHENA: I believed in you...
COLUMBUS: Give me absolution.
