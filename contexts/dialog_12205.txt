JAKE: What are you doing here?
MAST: I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
JAKE: Do the police want to arrest me?
MAST: Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
JAKE: Yeah, sure.
MAST: Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
JAKE: You sure as hell haven't been any help.
MAST: I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
JAKE: Why don't you tell me something for a change?
MAST: Like what?
JAKE: Who is Ratan?
MAST: Where'd you hear that name?
JAKE: I just heard. Who is he?
MAST: You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed... One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country. How'd you hear about him?
JAKE: It's just a name.
MAST: Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
JAKE: Does she know anything about this?
MAST: Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
