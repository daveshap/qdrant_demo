JAMES LEER: I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
GRADY: I guess there's probably a story behind that.
JAMES LEER: There is, but it's not that interesting.
GRADY: So where have you been staying?
JAMES LEER: The bus station.
JAMES LEER: It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
GRADY: But James. I mean... How long?
JAMES LEER: A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
GRADY: Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
JAMES LEER: Who?
GRADY: I don't know... Me.
