No fact-checking thread for tonight's debate
Dear users,

The [live fact-checking thread for the first US presidential debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/54nezg/first_debate_factchecking_thread/) was a big hit, but also a tremendous amount of work.

Unfortunately, due to an extremely depleted mod staff over the holiday weekend, we will not be able to repeat the fact-checking initiative for tonight's debate. In the run-up to the third debate, we'll assess our resources and see if we can do it again. Sorry if we're disappointing anyone. We hope you understand.

Despite there being no fact-checking thread, feel free to submit posts about the debate that comply with [our regular submission rules.](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules)

Kind regards,

â€” the /r/NeutralPolitics mod team
