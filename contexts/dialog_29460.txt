CARLOS: It's Saturday, Arnie. You work too hard.
ARNIE: Carl, I'm running late. I'm coming right now --
CARLOS: Don't bother.
ARNIE: What?
CARLOS: So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
ARNIE: I was just waiting for the right time.
CARLOS: And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
ARNIE: I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it. It could have been frozen along with everything else.
CARLOS: You had it all figured out. You move into my house. You raise my kids. You sleep with my wife. It was a good plan, Arnie.
ARNIE: Carl, that's insane.
CARLOS: So my wife is lying?
ARNIE: Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed. I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
CARLOS: Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
ARNIE: Carl --
CARLOS: Goodbye Arnie.
