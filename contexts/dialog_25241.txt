BONES: Hi... Busy?
SPOCK: Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
BONES: Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine. I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
SPOCK: ... My shoes...
BONES: Forget it... How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
SPOCK: I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
BONES: Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
SPOCK: It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
BONES: You're joking...!
SPOCK: A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
BONES: You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
SPOCK: Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
KIRK: What is it?
UHURA: Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
KIRK: On screen!
