Girl Advice Help!
Hey. So I’m a 17 year old male and I am in high school. I have a serious problem talking to girls. I am just so nervous around them and I feel like whenever I talk to them they think that I’m ugly or something. I work as a cashier for a part time job and whenever a girl around my age comes in I become a nervous wreak and mess up my job. (Asking if they want a bag more than once, saying have a good night when it’s morning, etc.) So I’m wondering if anyone has any tips for talking to girls? I’d appreciate the help thanks!
