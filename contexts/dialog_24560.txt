SUGAR: You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
JOE: You are?
SUGAR: That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
JOE: About what?
SUGAR: About the future. You know - like a husband? That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
JOE: What's in Florida?
SUGAR: Millionaires. Flocks of them. They all go south for the winter. Like birds.
JOE: Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
SUGAR: Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
JOE: You're entitled.
SUGAR: Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
JOE: Yeah. With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
SUGAR: I want mine to wear glasses.
JOE: Glasses?
SUGAR: Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
JOE: Well, now that you've mentioned it -
SUGAR: They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
