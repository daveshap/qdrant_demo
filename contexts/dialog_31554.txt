DREIBERG: The Comedian. He's dead. Murdered. That's all I know.
VEIDT: My God. Murdered? -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
DREIBERG: It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory. He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
VEIDT: Us. You mean the Watchmen.
DREIBERG: I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
VEIDT: You know how he is. He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied. It blows over.
DREIBERG: He's bound to get caught. I don't want my name coming out. Not at this late date.
VEIDT: If he comes here, I'll handle him. Remember -- I've always protected you. Haven't I? Do you need money?
DREIBERG: No. I just wanted you to --
VEIDT: You did the right thing, Daniel. Let's stay in touch, okay? Good night.
DREIBERG: Good night.
