MAN: I'll kiss the baby for you.
JENNY: I love you.
SONNY: Sal, I'm sorry about this. But we can get outta this thing. There's a way outta this.
SAL: Are you serious? About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
SONNY: Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out. Okay?
SAL: But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
SONNY: I want him to think that.
SAL: But I want to know what you think.
SONNY: We won't have to.
SAL: I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
