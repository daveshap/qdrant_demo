DIANE: What?
JIM: I just had a phone call.
DIANE: Tell me, is it bad news?
JIM: No, no, just listen. You won the Wreath fellowship.
DIANE: Are you kidding? You're not kidding? You're not kidding!
JIM: You won it. You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
DIANE: I won?
JIM: You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss. You stand up straight and admit you're special.
DIANE: God, I'll have to go on a plane.
JIM: We'll worry about that later. Now come on, tell me that you're special.
DIANE: Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
JIM: No, listen to me. You're the best in the country, don't you understand? It's like a pyramid. It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents. And it's you. So tell me something, where's the flaw in that? There is no flaw.
