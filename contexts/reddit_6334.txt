Accepted a job offer and their site is telling me to complete the new hire orientation.
Pretty much the title of this post. I received a job offer and accepted and I have been completing some requirements they have been emailing me about background checks and what not. 

I have been getting automated emails and texts stating that my new hire forms are incomplete, so I logged in and figured it was just a few quick things like signing off on at will employment, data confidentiality, etc. It was about 13 pages of things I had to sign off on and I thought that would be it, but now it wants me to continue with what looks like the entire orientation process. I always thought this was something that should be done during the first day of work, considering it is a lot of paperwork to go through and I should be compensated for it because it is so lengthy.

Can they require me to complete this process before my start date?
