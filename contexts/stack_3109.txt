What does the \"lowest order adiabatic approximation\" mean? I came across a concept \"lowest order adiabatic approximation\" in solid-state physics. I searched and found dozens of \"lowest order adiabatic approximation\". I think the \"lowest order adiabatic approximation\" is just the common \"adiabatic approximation\i.e., the motion of the lattice does not induce transitions of electronic states. Beyond this \"lowest order\the motion of the lattice would lead to transitions of electronic states. Am I right?
