STANLEY: Agent Desmond, it's...
DESMOND: It's late, Sam.
STANLEY: It's not late, it's early. Really early.
IRENE: You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
DESMOND: What do you mean?
IRENE: Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking. I just thought I ought to tell you.
DESMOND: Thanks.
STANLEY: I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
DESMOND: I think that's a good idea.
DESMOND: I think we should see the sun rise at the Canyon Trailer Park.
STANLEY: Are you speaking to me in a code?
DESMOND: No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
STANLEY: In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
