ENID: God, how can you stand all these assholes?
REBECCA: I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
ENID: At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
REBECCA: He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
ENID: That rules!
REBECCA: No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
ENID: But those are our people...
REBECCA: Yeah, well... So when are you going to get your job?
ENID: I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
REBECCA: Like what?
ENID: Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
REBECCA: God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
