NORA: Nick! Nick! Are you asleep?
NICK: Yes.
NORA: Good. I want to talk to you.
NICK: That's jolly.
NORA: Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
NICK: Can't you get to sleep?
NORA: No.
NICK: Maybe a drink would help you.
NORA: No thanks.
NICK: Maybe it would if I took it.
NORA: Everybody says you were a grand detective.
NICK: They were kidding you.
NORA: I'd like to see you work.
NICK: Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
NORA: That poor girl is in a tough spot.
NICK: There's nothing I can do to help her.
NORA: She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
NICK: Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
NORA: I think I would like that drink. I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
NICK: At breakfast.
NORA: But it's Christmas now.
NICK: Breakfast.
NORA: What are you going to give me? I hope I don't like it.
NICK: You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
