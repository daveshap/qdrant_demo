SUSAN: Ow!
KANE: What's the matter with you?
SUSAN: Toothache.
KANE: Hmm!
SUSAN: You've got some on your face.
KANE: If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
KANE: What's funny now?
SUSAN: You are. You look like you've been making mud pies.
SUSAN: Oh!
KANE: You're no Venus de Milo.
SUSAN: If you want to come in and wash your face - I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
KANE: Thanks.
