Is the Trump Administration's use of the Espionage Act against Julian Assange constitutional?
In 1971, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the New York Times and Washington Post in the United States' suit against them^[1](https://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep403/usrep403713/usrep403713.pdf); the Nixon Administration cited the Espionage Act of 1917 in support of it's position to prevent those media outlets from publishing classified documents.^[2](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1045/espionage-act-of-1917) The Government claimed that the actions of the New York Times and Washington Post, in publishing the Pentagon Papers (officially known as the *Report of the Office of Defense Vietnam Task Force* or *History of U. S. Decision-Making Process on Viet Nam Policy*), represented a grave threat to national security.    

Julian Assange is being charged by the U.S Government under sections 793(g), 793(b), 793(c), 793(d) and 793(e) of the Espionage Act, and sections 371 and 1030 of the *Computer Fraud and Abuse Act*.^[3](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1037-julian-assange-espionage-act-indictment/426b4e534ab60553ba6c/optimized/full.pdf#page=1)  The Justice Department national security division claims that Julian Assange "is no journalist" and presumably should not be subject to the same protection as a news media corporation.^[4](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/wikileaks-founder-assange-indicted-under-espionage-act.html)

1.  Is criminalizing the publication of secret government documents under the Espionage Act of 1917 constitutional?

2.  Did the Government achieve a sufficient level of evidence to fulfill the requirements for prior restraint?^[5](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/95-815.pdf)*
