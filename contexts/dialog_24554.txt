JERRY: Good night, Sugar.
SUGAR: Good night, honey.
JERRY: Honey - she called me honey.
JERRY: What are you doing?
JOE: I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive. There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
JERRY: But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
JOE: Fight it.
JERRY: But suppose I lose? Suppose it's an emergency?
JOE: Then pull the emergency brake!
SUE: You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
BIENSTOCK: Funny? In what way?
SUE: I don't know - but I can feel it right here. That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
