to the girls & guys smiling through their depression ❤️

i know things are hard rn & you feel like you’ll never truly be happy . you feel like your world is falling apart & there’s nothing you can do but watch . you feel scared , empty & sometimes you feel nothing . you aren’t okay , but you look like it

you paint on a smile , dress in fine clothes & pretend like you’re fine . you put your depression aside , so you can maybe put a smile on someone else’s face . you let people walk all over you & feel sorry for those who hurt you
you bottle everything up , so no one knows how you truly feel . you’re tired of the way things are & feeling this way . you’re tired of faking your way through life by pretending to be this strong & happy person . you’re tired of having to put up so many walls to protect yourself

you may feel put down by others & the things they say , but you don’t say anything because you don’t want anyone else to feel the way you do . you want everyone to like you , even when you know it’s better to just steer away from them

you’ve been hurt before , maybe more than once . you refuse to let anyone in because you fear they won’t stay . you want to be happy more than anything , but you’re scared you’ll ruin it . you fear that you’ll run off the only good thing that has ever happened to you
so many people who struggle with depression hesitate to get help because of a stigma . our society has conditioned us to be ashamed of our “negative” emotions

we’re reminded of how lucky we are , of how many would feel blessed to be in our shoes , etc . but in reality , that doesn’t help with depression . is depressed people know our circumstances & i for one often feel guilty for being sad despite everything

let me tell you something . you’re beautiful . you’re strong . you’re better than this . you can & will overcome it , if you believe you can . there are other people just like you , all over the world that are going through this with you . you’re not alone

there are people in your life that care about you & would do anything they possibly could for you . those people that hurt you aren’t worth you crying over . you should never let anyone make you feel less important than you are
one day you’ll be happy , look back on this & realize how much time you wasted worrying about people who don’t even matter . you’ll have people in your life that make you feel so blessed that you may even forget this

stay strong & remember that you’re all strong , beautiful , amazing individuals who deserve the world & are destined for greatness ❤️ . God bless you 🙏🏼
