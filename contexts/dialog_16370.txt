OTIS: So.
DEL: So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
OTIS: This is an official visit, then--
DEL: I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
OTIS: Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
DEL: We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
OTIS: Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
DEL: That's right.
OTIS: I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
DEL: The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
OTIS: Right.
DEL: I hear things, too. People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
OTIS: Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
DEL: And people make their choice--
OTIS: A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
OTIS: I gonna meet that family of yours?
DEL: Why would you want to do that?
OTIS: Because I'm your father.
DEL: You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
CAROLYN: So that's him--
