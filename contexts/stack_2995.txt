What lets photons travel? Electricity flows from a point of higher level of potential toward a point of lower potential. Liquids flow from a point of higher level toward a point of lower level. I want to know, in the same manner, how do we explain the flow of photons in a beam of light from its source of origin, say, from a candle or from the sun?
