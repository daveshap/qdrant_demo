Late payroll at new startup position
So, I just started a new position at a startup.  This is my third day on the job and none of the employees were paid on time this week. 

The company has hired over 100 employees in the last few months and they seem to be bored/without work a majority of the time. 

Am I wrong to already want to jump ship due to these red flags? I have never worked for a startup before so not really used to this type of environment. I have savings so I have a little wiggle room to job search.
