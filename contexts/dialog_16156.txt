ROBIN: Is your back still killing you?
GEORGE: I didn't think you'd come today.
ROBIN: I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
GEORGE: No. Mostly me.
ROBIN: Peter left me yesterday.
GEORGE: Left you?
ROBIN: No goodbye. No fuck you. No 'Are you in love with George?'
GEORGE: What did he say?
ROBIN: 'I'll be in the bedroom.'
