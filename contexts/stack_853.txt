How to customize the LXTerminal console in Lubuntu 16.04? first say hello, I'm new to the site.I just installed Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS on my computer and I still have to familiarize myself with the OS.One of the things I can not change is the appearance of LXTerminal, which comes from black background and white letters.I just wanted to change, for example, the color of the place where I am.Example: user @ user: ~ / Documents $As I say, everything is blank. Only the directories that are blue change.I have seen several articles, but in none I find the editing tools that this console has.It shows me: Edit> Preferences> And there are only four tabs to choose from:Style, Show, Advanced, ShortcutsI can not find a way to give it a little appearance, I have seen that with commands it is also possible, but with what I saw so far I am not capable.If you can give me some idea or where to look for information.Thank you
