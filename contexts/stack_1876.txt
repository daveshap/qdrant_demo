Can \"some couldn't know\" be used to console somebody? A : \"Hey pal, I don't think I can go on anymore. I feel people around me are much greater than me. I feel I'm useless and nobody cares about me.\"<br>B : \"Don't worry. It's okay. Some couldn't know.\" (= there are some who couldn't understand the true value of you) Does it make sense? I guess it's fine since \"how could they know\" in Rebel Rebel by David Bowie has a similar meaning.
