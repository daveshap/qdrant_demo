Delete all files of a resolution Apple Photos I have recently, imported various photos from both iCloud Shared Album downloads and directly from my iPhone. The problem is that some of these photos are duplicates, however the iCloud Shared Album duplicates are exactly half the resolution.Duplicate scanners I have tried fail detecting these duplicates because of their different resolution. Additionally, I want to make sure I delete the low-res versions.Is it possible to batch-delete photos by resolution in Photos.app?
