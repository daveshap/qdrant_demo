VICTOR: This is a bad time, Henry. I'm busy just now. What do you want?
HENRY: Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
VICTOR: Yes? And?
HENRY: Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
VICTOR: You'll be leaving then. Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
