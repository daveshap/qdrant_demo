JERRY: Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England. No small doing.
SALLY: I love you, you're a genius.
JERRY: I suppose. Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
SALLY: I adore him.
JERRY: The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning. The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
SALLY: I know. I know that. Don't spoil it.
JERRY: What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
SALLY: We've only been over this how many times?
JERRY: You only made half your quote this year.
SALLY: Well, you're a tower of support.
JERRY: I worry because you don't. It's my job. I'm feeling guilty. I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
SALLY: We couldn't be on more solid ground.
JERRY: Whatever you say. Listen, I love you.
JOE: Otis! No barking!
SALLY: And Joe's huge in Europe. He's like a rock star in London. His novels sell millions.
JERRY: Not millions.
SALLY: He's directing now.
JERRY: They're paying him scale.
SALLY: He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that. You know how he hates it here.
JERRY: There's still time to undo this.
SALLY: We'll be fine.
JERRY: Did you invite them?
SALLY: The Roses? And of course they said yes.
JERRY: That was the plan. And you're thrilled to have them.
SALLY: Whatever you say.
JERRY: Did you tell Joe to behave?
SALLY: Yes.
JERRY: Did he promise?
SALLY: Scout's honor.
JERRY: Before I forget. Put it on the bookshelf.
SALLY: You're out of your mind.
JERRY: Just do what I say, alright?
SALLY: How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
JERRY: Beats a lawsuit.
JOE: I love gifts. What did you guys get us?
JUDY: Nothing that can't be exchanged.
JOE: Oh. Well. Good.
JUDY: Congratulations on the deal. How exciting. Is Sally doing Sally? I mean it's Sally. The character that's based on Sally. The character that's based on Sally in the book.
JOE: The novel. No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
JUDY: Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
JOE: Yes, she is.
JUDY: But I am right, yes? She's based on Sally.
JOE: It's a novel.
JUDY: Still. Well. Let's drop it.
JOE: Yes.
JUDY: I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes. Mostly non-fiction. Did you read the new Styron?
JOE: No.
JUDY: It's very good. I understand you won the Booker Prize.
JOE: Yes I did.
JUDY: Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good. But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, what's this?" You know? I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all. Because
JOE: Don't I find what?
JUDY: I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
JOE: Not long.
JUDY: Don't be silly.
JOE: Joking.
JUDY: Yes I know. I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
JOE: Do I put you off?
JUDY: You manage to throw me off balance. I adore you.
JOE: And I you.
JUDY: But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
JOE: Ah.
JUDY: And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
JOE: Mmm hmmm.
