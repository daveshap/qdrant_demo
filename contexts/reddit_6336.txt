Feedback from going through thousands of applications from reddit
Hi Jobseekers,

We've already had three job openings at reddit this past year, including this one for [sales support position posted today](http://redd.it/1wwfgi). We've had great success finding awesome candidates in /r/ForHire and relevant local subreddits, but we're seeing some common mistakes over and over again. I thought I'd share some of the most common ones we've seen in the thousand or so applications we've triaged this year.  

Hope these tips are helpful in your search.  Will answer any questions in the comments:

* Name your damn files. If you are attaching or uploading files (resume/cover letter/etc) put your name in filename. I now have 200 files on my computer called resume.doc, and a bunch with even worse labels like summer_2013_webjobs_resume.pdf.  

* Don't apply for a full time job while you are in high school or college unless you have a really good reason. Appreciate the confidence, but you're most likely wasting both of our time.  

* If you have non-traditional experience that you feel would help you do the job you're applying for, that's excellent, but it's up to you to explain how the experience would relate. Don't assume people will understand jargon from a different industry in your resume no matter how impressive. Make your case in the cover letter and resume itself. have a friend who is not in the industry read over it and make sure they understand any jargon etc.        

* Showing a sense of humor can be great in the right context, but if you have any doubts, err on the side of caution. A bad joke can be a deal killer.  

* Speak directly to the job description being offered. It's often clear from the resume and cover letter that applicants didn't really read the job description. Are you right for this particular job, or are you just interested in the company, location, etc.?  

* Don't talk about how you really wanted to be a film director, game designer, zoo keeper, etc but just couldn't cut it (unless there was like a career ending injury or something else outside your control). Everyone can relate, but it's not really your best look.  

* Spelling and grammar matter. You don't have to be 100% perfect, but sloppiness is a killer.  

* Even if the job is open to relocation, local candidates will most likely be favored. If you are not local, be convincing about how relocating won't be an issue.   

* Get someone to look over your resume and anything else in your application. A second opinion is always a good idea.  

* If there are truly optional fields, you should have a good reason to skip. Why pass up a chance to make your case?  

* If you are not applying for an hourly job, don't include what you made hourly for past positions on your resume.
