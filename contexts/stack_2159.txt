What's the best way to find a car in Player Unknown's Battlegrounds? I like playing the outer edges of the map, but sometimes the first circle is all the way on the other side and I end up pretty much guaranteed to die unless I can find a car.And I'm really, really bad at finding a car.What kinds of places do they spawn?
