Petition to ban 'paid-off' posts
I know I'm not the only one. I don't have any actual content from this sub showing on my feed anymore. It's always the "I just paid off my huge debt" posts which simply aren't attainable for a majority of people on this sub. A very large amount of visible posts in my feed are humble brags that aren't achievable for 90%+ of the userbase.

I'm super happy that some people are planning and executing their plans to pay back their debt well. However I feel this subs focus should be more on tips and advice rather than a collection of payment receipt pictures. The former has substance while the latter does not.

Again, nothing personal against all of you that are kicking ass, I'm very happy for you, I just don't think that content is right for the sub and would like to see something done about it. 

Thoughts?

edit: I'm not saying that paying off debts is unattainable for 90% of the userbase, I was specifically referring to the posts that show thousands or sometimes ten thousand plus dollar payments to clear out a loan. Unfortunately even the good natured "hey I'm so happy I paid off my loan after seven years" still bottlenecks any sort of actual content on this sub. I'm not against people or being happy or proud or anything, I'd just rather seem a greater use of this space. The endless stream of payment receipts adds nothing.

edit 2, I swear I'm done after this: Just for further clarification, I mean the pictures of payments to debtors and pictures of $0 account balances. Text posts about how you paid your shit off I still 100% support.
