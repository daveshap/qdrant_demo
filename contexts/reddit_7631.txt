Waiting to hear on First Author Pub Review
Hi there r/GradSchool, I'm a History MA student who's been waiting for nearly three weeks to hear back from a pub I submitted to with my advisor's recommendation. The deadline for submissions for this issue was Friday (14th) - but the journal submission policy has the typical "we are committed to getting you a decision as quickly as possible" boilerplate. 

How long does it usually take to hear from pubs in the Humanities? I just want to stop having nightmares about getting a rejection for my research being "derivative and repetitive."
