Which degree will be best for the job?
So I graduated a year ago with a bachelor's in journalism which, surprise, has not been put to use. After researching the field, I want to make the change to a job in Human Resource Management. My question is, with my bachelor's in a non-business field, would the best next step be a master's on top of what I have, an associates and then a master's, or a completely new bachelor's in business?
