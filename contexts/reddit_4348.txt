I’ve skipped 2 whole weeks of class and still don’t feel like going
I’ve been absolutely drained mentally. I tried liking college and studying but I just feel like I need some time off. Problem is: I don’t want to disappoint my parents. They’re the best and deserve much better. I just don’t have any motivation at all to get up at 6 am, shower at 6:30, go to class at 8:30 and sit between strangers until 6 pm and be home at 7 pm.  I also fear of being a failure with a shitty job in the future but not even that motivates me to go to class or study every day.
