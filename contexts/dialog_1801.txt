KIRKEBY: Please, Sylvia! It's a quarter to nine!
SYLVIA: First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
KIRKEBY: Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
SYLVIA: What guy? Whose apartment is this, anyway?
KIRKEBY: What's the difference? Some schnook that works in the office.
MRS. LIEBERMAN: Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
BUD: Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
MRS. LIEBERMAN: Some weather we're having. Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral. You locked out of your apartment?
BUD: No, no. Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
MRS. LIEBERMAN: Good night, Mr. Baxter.
