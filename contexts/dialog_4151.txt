CALIBANOS: Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
GEORGE: Yes, I am.
CALIBANOS: Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
GEORGE: No, I cam here out of my own volition.
CALIBANOS: Excuse me?
GEORGE: Something about vengance being best served cold.
CALIBANOS: Really. Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
GEORGE: Excuse me?
CALIBANOS: Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
GEORGE: I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole. Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old. That's some fucking deal. I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here. I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
CALIBANOS: So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?
