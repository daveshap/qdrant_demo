Accessing raster values to create histogram using ArcPy? Using native Python and arcpy function what method is best to create a histogram of raster dataset? I know it's possible to use raterio and GDAL functions, but I would like to keep it a arcpy and native Python.Specifically I am working on a script to delineate watersheds and I would like to create a raster based on the values in a flow accumulation raster dataset. From the calculated raster I would then convert to vector stream layers. The ultimate goal is to be able to create separate stream order layers.
