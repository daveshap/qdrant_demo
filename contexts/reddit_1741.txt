A rant - realizing that I fucked up in HS: average kids with average stats rise up
I’m breaking down atm and just coming to terms with the fact that since I’m an average student with average stats, I’m barely gonna get scholarships and merit aid at schools I apply to which means we have to pay a lot. I’m also low income so that doesn’t help. Why couldn’t I have just thought about the future in freshman year, taken more AP classes, realized how much weight my grades really have, and constantly grinded to get a better SAT and GPA to get into schools I want with little debt? I just feel like I’m making even more of a burden for my parents financially because I’m a shitty student even if I tried my best. Can’t turn back the clock now. Fuck my life lol

edit: okay wow this unexpectedly blew up, I can’t really reply to everyone but thank you guys for the support and advice.
