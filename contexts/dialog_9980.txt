MUTCHIE: I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on. She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, Hey
DOYLE: Strike out, eh?
MUTCHIE: Yeah. In the late innings. Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
DOYLE: A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
MUTCHIE: When ya go back on?
DOYLE: Morning. Sometime.
MUTCHIE: Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours. The kid comes in at six will wake ya. A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
