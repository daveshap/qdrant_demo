With an overstay tag will l get another European Visa? I came into the UK in 2016 on a tier 4 Visa that was due to expire at the end of my course in September 2019. In December 2017 I was withdrawn from my course and reported to the Home office by my university  because I couldn't pay my tuition fees anymore. I got a letter from home office to leave the country within 2 months but now l have overstayed with more than 5 months. I want to apply to other European universities like in France, Poland and Bulgaria. With a tag of overstay that I have now will l be able to get another European Student Visa?
