(19F) Taking on the responsibility of a child soon
[KY, USA] Due to reasons no fault of my own, my parent is going to be incarcerated soon. That leaves responsibility of my sibling (6F) to me. I have enrolled and am on the waiting list for CNA classes, so should be getting paid anywhere from $9-11 an hour. I'm already looking into low-income housing, utility help, and general help from the government. I just think I'd ask here for any advice regarding how to budget my finances.

Things to consider:

Lowest rent I've found is $595 2bed 1ba for low-income housing with water, sewer, and trash included. I should qualify for low-income assistance.

I have a car and my insurance is $100 a month. I have student loans that are $50 a month. My car is not working now and I have it quoted around $500-600 to get it fixed. However, I'm willing to walk to work and save up money to get it fixed. 

Need advice on how to parent. I have raised two other siblings although not to this degree of care. Is there any after school programs I could look into? How can I be the best provider for my sibling?

For those wondering about any relatives should could go to, both likely candidates live out of state. I also do want to keep her close, even if means sacrificing years to raise her. Any advice helps. 

EDIT: I am honestly in disbelief of the kindness that people still have for one another. I have had offers of help from many sweet people. You all are so beautiful. It has really touched my heart and I have to admit, I have teared up reading all of y'alls comments. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You all give me hope that I can be a better person and a better sister. 

EDIT 2: You all are a great asset and I am very happy I posted here to such a great community. I am sorry that I haven't responded to everyone, but I will try my best! I've gotten a flood of PMs, kind-hearted people reaching out to help. It's really humbling. I can only offer a thanks of gratitude to you all.
