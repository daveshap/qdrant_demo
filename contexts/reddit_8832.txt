Can someone explain the Syrian Problem, as it stands, and provide as much background to the situation as possible? I dont know what is really happening.
So i am not really into politics, not really at all, but when something as big as this comes around I like to get the facts and not so much the "news". 

Basically if someone could provide a timeline as to what is happening that would help me out a lot.

Also if you would like to provide any solutions you have, or any ideas you think would improve this situation feel free.  

Thanks.
