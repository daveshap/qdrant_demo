Cannot find work that satisfies me. Getting depressed.
I am highly intelligent (read: Mensa). I have a university degree in humanities. I get bored very easily.

I cannot find work that satisfies me.

I am now bored to the degree that I am getting depressed by my work. I hate my job, and I dread every day when I have to leave for work. My work quality is bad, and I fear the day it will be discovered.

I know I have to quit, but I have no other line of work I can apply for. I've been searching for jobs for several months, but I rarely find anything that is even mildly interesting. Getting another boring job will just lead to the same thing (I have tried).

The thing is I cannot find work that is challenging. Most jobs consists of menial tasks with no thinking required.

I know this might come off as arrogant, but I hope someone will understand the feeling of throwing one's life away. I know I have great potential, but I cannot find a way to express it. Besides work I have a family, so using my spare time to follow my passions is not going to work.

I am not happy if I am not challenged, and I cannot find any jobs that challenges me in the right way. I am loosing hope in ever finding a job that will give me some kind of satisfaction. I should probably have become a scientist or researcher, but that is too late now. Being a father in my 30's means I cannot afford to go back to study.

Being unhappy also makes me a bad parent and SO, and knowing that just makes me more unhappy. I am in a bad downward spiral and I don't know how to exit. I am probably not clinically depressed yet, but I am getting there...
