Which place is better to work at? McDonalds or Chipotle?
I'm a teenager trying to apply at either McDonalds or Chipotle so I can make a quick buck. I'm trying to be a crew member and prepare food and am not trying to be a cashier.  


From experience, which is place is better. It would be really helpful if y'all responded.
