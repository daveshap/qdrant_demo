GIBBS: We've stopped dumping... but we've only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
KORSHUNOV: We're not going to make it.
GIBBS: Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
KORSHUNOV: Where are we now?
GIBBS: Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
KORSHUNOV: No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe. The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and... refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
