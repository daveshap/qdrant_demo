What is the purpose of post-doctoral work and is it necessary for every PhD?
Good Morning,  

So I started my PhD in Microbiology last year, and I've been trying to wrap my head around what a Postdoc is. I get that they have completed their degree and are now training on a higher level of responsibility with their PI, but is this another requirement when it comes to the employment check list? I noticed that both PhD Grads and Postdocs don't have the Dr. title. Is that something given to people who have completed both? My long term plan is not to go into academia (Love to teach but would hate it as a job), is a Postdoc something that would boost my employment potential or is it a flat out requirement? Do people do Post-doctoral work at places other than universities?
