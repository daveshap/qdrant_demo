PAUL: So, another one bites the dust.
LETTY: It's not another one. It's my sister. Aren't you happy for her?
PAUL: She's only known the guy a few months.
PAUL: Can I put these here for tonight?
LETTY: In there's better. It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
PAUL: I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
LETTY: Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
PAUL: The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
LETTY: My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
PAUL: Good going. I knew you could do it.
LETTY: Yeah?
PAUL: Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
PAUL: I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
LETTY: I mean tonight.
PAUL: Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
LETTY: Oh, ok. Maybe.
PAUL: But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
LETTY: Sure. Of course.
