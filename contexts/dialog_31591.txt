DREIBERG: Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach. The world's about to end. If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.

DREIBERG: SHUT UP, Rorschach.
RORSCHACH: Sorry, Daniel. You've always been a good friend. I know that. Sorry about Laurie.
DREIBERG: Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
