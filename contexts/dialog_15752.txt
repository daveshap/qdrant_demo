MUNRO: Told you to stay away from this hell hole! Why did you disobey me?
CORA: When? How?
MUNRO: My letter...
CORA: There was none!
MUNRO: What?
CORA: There was no letter.
MUNRO: I sent three men to Webb!
HEYWARD: One called Magua arrived.
CORA: He delivered no such message.
MUNRO: Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
HEYWARD: Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
MUNRO: What happened to you?
HEYWARD: Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it. ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
MUNRO: Thank you. How can I reward you?
HAWKEYE: Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
MUNRO: What else?
