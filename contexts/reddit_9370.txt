Paid off my car
My car was only $8k but I’ve been working so hard to pay off debt. I estimate what it takes to pay bills and then I allow a $200 or $300 cushion. All the extra money goes toward whatever bill I’m trying to pay off. I wanted to pay my car off since it is the largest minimum payment per month. 

I have a history of bankruptcy and financial abuse and poverty and finally over came that. I can’t believe I paid off a debt. 

I’m currently pregnant and trying to become as debt free as I can before I take maternity leave.

I know it’s not always possible to make enough to pay off debt. Right now I’m able to. But can’t afford furniture. Being poor sucks and debt makes you a slave.
