Is an employee survey really anonymous?
Hi friends,

I am working at a big corporate and every quarter, they send employees a survey. Before sending the survey, the CEO always sends all employees an email, encouraging them to fill the survey and be as honest as possible. They emphasize that the survey is (of course) anonymous.

I want to be as honest as possible, but something in the back of my mind tells me not do it. Is a survey really anonymous? I always think it is a sleazy way for companies to filter "rotten apples" and fire them based on (of course) other reasons.
