Why do I feel guilty for wanting to find a better paying job?
As the title says I feel guilty and don't know why. I really like my current job and the people I work with but the pay isn't the best. I feel like everyone will think of me as a deserter that doesn't care about any of them or the business. The thought of going up to boss and bringing this up terrifies me and I know it shouldn't. This is normal thing that people do all the time but for whatever reason I can't seem to rationalize this to myself. Is it normal to have these feeling or am I just being really over the top right now?
