BARTON: ...This must be boring you.
CHARLIE: Not at all. It's damned interesting.
BARTON: Yeah...
BARTON: ...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
CHARLIE: Beery! You got no beef there! He's good. Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
BARTON: Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
CHARLIE: Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.

BARTON: That's all right, really –
CHARLIE: Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here...
