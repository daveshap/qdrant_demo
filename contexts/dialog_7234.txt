KEATING: What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
NEIL: Yeah.
KEATING: Really? You told your father what you told me? You let him see your passion for acting?
NEIL: Yeah. He didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. Of course, he won't be able to come. He'll be in Chicago on business. But I think he's gonna let me stay with acting. As long as I keep my grades up.
