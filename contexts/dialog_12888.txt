GRACE: Molly!
MOLLY: Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
GRACE: You're having me on, Molly.
MOLLY: Am I? Maybe I am.
GRACE: You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
MOLLY: Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
SUE: I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
BILL: It's easy. I've done it.
SUE: Who with?
BILL: Pauline.
SUE: Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how.
BRUCE: Boy, that was some air-raid.
DAWN: Air-raid?
BRUCE: Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
