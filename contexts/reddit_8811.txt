The senators say the updated law increases congressional oversight and transparency while providing the executive with updated authorities to fight non-state terrorists.  

Efforts have failed in the past to [repeal] (https://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/13/politics/senate-isis-war-vote/index.html) or [update] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/us/politics/aumf-congress-niger.html) the AUMFs.
