I'm getting a nearly $5 an hour raise
Something marvelous happened. I work for the county and they did a salary survey and my position was found to be underpaid. So next paycheck I'll be getting a raise plus a 3% cost of living increase. I currently work part-time and I want to automatically save more money into my Ally accounts. Anyone have any ideas to avoid lifestyle creep? I currently work 2 side gigs, we have a roommate and my husband works full-time.
