My friend/coworker warned me that I might get fired and there was a complaint filed against me.
I have been working at this company for almost 4 years now. We recently hired a COO and ever since he began, there has been a lot of company restructuring. Just yesterday a senior manager was fired out of the blue, as well as one of the IT guys.

My coworker and friend is an HR assistant for the company and told me today to be careful, as apparently there was a complaint filed against me. The odd thing is that this coworker who complained doesn't even work in my department - I've only ever dealt with her once. Apparently she went to the CEO of the company and told them that I am incompetent, I am unproductive and I provide no value to the company. My HR coworker told me she wanted me to be aware of this so that I am not left with any surprises. 

As far as I know, I get everything completed and do my job properly. There are some times when I have a lot on my plate and don't fulfill minor requests immediately and may take a few days or require a reminder, but this doesn't happen often. Other than that I have never made any major mistakes or have felt incompetent. I was told by my boss literally last month that if she felt I was not doing a good job, she would let me know. 

I'm just not sure if I should be doing anything about this information I have been provided? I've been going to work with the worry that tomorrow will be my last day. I'm not sure if I should bring up this knowledge to my boss, or just do nothing as I don't want to possibly throw my coworker under the bus? Should I just sit around and await my pending fate?
