JOHN ELLIS: Didn't they tell you?
ENID: Tell me what?
JOHN ELLIS: Punk rock is over!
ENID: I know it's over, asshole, I --
JOHN ELLIS: If you really want to fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!"
ENID: That's not even --
JOHN ELLIS: Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
JOHN ELLIS: Oh, how punk.""
ENID: That tape sucked, by the way!
JOHN ELLIS: I'm so sorry if you were offended!
ENID: Go die, asshole!
JOHN ELLIS: Get a job!
REBECCA: What was that all about?
ENID: It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
REBECCA: I didn't get it either.
ENID: Everybody's too stupid!
ENID: Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
SEYMOUR: So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
ENID: Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?"
SEYMOUR: The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
ENID: Wow!
SEYMOUR: Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
ENID: Yeah, sure, I guess...
SEYMOUR: Watch my stuff.
JOE: You still interested in that?
ENID: I thought it wasn't for sale.
JOE: I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
ENID: It's kind of falling apart.
