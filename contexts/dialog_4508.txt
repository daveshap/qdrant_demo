FUTURE MAN: How's that 700 bucks coming?
BOB: I'm working on it.
FUTURE MAN: Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
ANTHONY: I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
BOB: Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
ANTHONY: Were you adopted, Bob?
BOB: Why do you say that?
ANTHONY: Well, because you guys don't look alike.
BOB: No. I wasn't adopted.
ANTHONY: Was Future Man adopted?
BOB: Jesus Christ! No.
DIGNAN: There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
APPLEJACK: Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
DIGNAN: Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
APPLEJACK: That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
DIGNAN: We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
APPLEJACK: Is that Buckethead?
