FATHER: Will I still be able to play?
SZPILMAN: Let's find out.
SZPILMAN: Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
JUREK: Wladek! How are you?
SZPILMAN: Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
JUREK: Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--
SZPILMAN: Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
JUREK: ...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.
SZPILMAN: Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
DOROTA: I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
SZPILMAN: You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
DOROTA: Really?
SZPILMAN: Yes! It was...it was unforgettable.
DOROTA: I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
SZPILMAN: Wladek, please.
DOROTA: No one plays Chopin like you.
