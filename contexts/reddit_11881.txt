Trying to get my life moving where I want and my mom isn't helping
I'm an engineering major who wants to work in renewables(perfect timing, I know). I'm job hunting right now and it's got me really down for various reasons. A bit of backstory before I get into what's happening now.

---

I had a summer internship after my junior year of college (the company was cool, but I wasn't a fan of the field or the location). I did well and they were enthusiastic about hiring me after I graduated. When I visited them over winter break though they couldn't offer me a job for financial reasons (they later did almost a year after I graduated). Since working for them after I graduated was my plan, I was kind of screwed (for those not in a STEM field, if you don't have a job lined up before your second semester senior year you're pretty SOL since all the summer hiring is done in the fall, at least where I went to school).

So I graduated and went job hunting in a state I didn't particularly like but it was where my "contacts" were. I didn't like any of the jobs I applied to and I was getting less help than I'd hoped. So after two months I didn't get any interviews and decided to go to grad school and get my MS while doing research. It went pretty well and I finally got an idea of what I wanted to do with my life, so I decided to stay at the university after I finished to get my PhD.

I thought my new project was going to be great. It was working with renewables, which is what I always wanted, but it pretty quickly turned out to be not what I expected. The machine I worked with was built in a rented out space in a metal shop (loud noises, no heating/AC, lots of smoke; all of which don't do well my my anxiety) and my main coworker didn't get along with anyone (myself included). I felt unimportant; the research was co-oped with a company, and they already had a company man doing this before I got on, so I wasn't exactly making any contributions another person couldn't make, and my coworker constantly make me feel inadequate. I fell into depression (for the second time in my life) and tried to get off the project the summer after my first year. My adviser asked me to give him some time to try and fix some problems, so I did, but things didn't get much better. A few months later I started feeling suicidal and brought up getting off the project again. Then it got dropped on me that I couldn't switch to a new project in the group and basically had 4 options:

1) Stay on the project.

2) Leave the group and join another professors group.

3) Leave the university and go to another one.

4) Leave graduate school and find a job.

I ended up going deciding to leave graduate school. Joining a research group after leaving another one creates a lot of distrust since your new adviser doesn't know if you'll stick around, and I honestly felt like I needed a break from school. I started job hunting at the end of November and finished up the semester on good terms. I also started getting my depression treated and I'm working on improving the quality of my life and well-being.

Which brings me to now. I’m still job hunting and so far I’ve only gotten one positive response to my applications but so far no interviews (the response was today actually; I've gotten very little feedback in general, which I’m trying to take as a good sign). I started looking in just one city and was looking at a few specific job types, but I’ve expanded out to 6 major cities and I’m looking at all relevant jobs.

Now to what’s been bothering me. For those who have been job hunting, you know it’s stressful, especially the waiting. Most of my family, so I thought, was being pretty supportive and understanding of the wait, albeit my parents are even more impatient than me since they haven’t had to hunt for a job since the 80s. My mom especially has been impatient, and has pushed me to start looking at other cities earlier than I needed to. This added onto my anxiety as I had been spending a lot of time reassuring myself that this is what job hunting is like and that it’s normal to not hear back for a while, and my mom was steadily undoing that reassurance.

Turns out my mom isn’t nearly as understanding as I’d thought. I found out that the company I did my internship with had a posting for a position that I could apply for. It was at their new location though, which was in a city I liked even less than where I did my internship. Additionally, it’s very far away from where I want to settle down and nothing I want to really do is happening in that city, so networking is out of the question. Also, the job won’t get me any relevant experience, so when I decide to move on I wouldn’t have anything to show for the two years I'd be stuck there except some income. I’d basically be in the exact same boat I’m in now, except I’ll be out of touch with the job market and my network, and will have wasted 2-3 years in a job that didn't help me move forward. I'm only recently started getting my depression under control and more than anything I don't want to be stuck in another situation I hate.

I made the mistake of telling my mom about the posting though, since she called the day after I saw the posting. She pushed me to try call up the CEO, since he’d probably be very happy to offer me an interview. I said I’d think about.

An hour later I get a call from a friend, whom helped me get my internship. He gave me a lecture about how I need to take any job anyplace I can get one in this market and *city I hate* is where a lot of people are going, even if they don't want to stay there long.

I realized as soon as we started talking what had happened: my mom called him to get him to talk me into applying. I was pretty upset, for obvious reasons and for another I didn’t realize until a few days later (more on that later). The next day my mom texted and asked if I had talked to the CEO, I said I hadn’t and I wasn’t going to apply for the reasons mentioned above; she didn’t respond. 

the day after I get a text from my sister asking about a **job offer I had passed up**. I got pretty angry at that and kinda blew up at my sister (not directing my anger at her thankfully). I explained, much less calmly, to her the reasons I’d told my mom, especially the fact it was a job posting and not an offer. She was understanding, since my mom has been on her lately as well. She was with my mom at the time so she said she’d call me later.

Around this time, I checked the posting again and it was already gone, so at the very least I wouldn’t get anymore crap for not applying. I reasoned that fi it had been taken down so soon after I'd found it, then they likely already had their candidate well before I saw it.

A few hours later, I get a call from my dad. At first we just caught up, but I knew where the conversation was going to head, and sure enough it did. He asked if I’m applying for many places and specifically at *big company in original city I wanted*, whom I’d already given an application. He was genuinely surprised to hear that, and even more so to hear that I wasn’t just looking at that city but at 5 others and I had branched the positions I was applying to (even though we’d talked before about all this). He then says that he talked to my mom (surprise surprise)(side note, they divorced 7 years ago and rarely talk; they both live in different states, my mom in the same one where the position was) and she had said I’d **passed up a job offer**. I repeated what I’d said to my sister and mention the post was already gone anyway, probably filled by the time I’d found it. He thinks my mom is getting paranoid over nothing and I’m not at the point yet of taking jobs just because I’m desperate. He said he'd talk to my mom, and I haven't heard back from either of them since.

Later my sister called and we had a pretty supportive conversation. She was there when my mom and dad talked and basically described that she’d told my dad I was “holding out for my dream job in my dream city and wasn’t considering anything else”. I was pretty pissed when I heard her say this, especially when my mom had told me earlier “I know you’re trying”. So basically she lied since apparently she doesn't feel I'm trying and decided to complain to my sister, dad, and friend, giving her own false interpretation of what was going on. 

It was about then I realized why I was really bothered by this. This was basically a repeat of an event from a few years ago. My mom had figured out a secret of mine (non-standard sexual interest, which she learned about by going through my dresser looking for a present for my sister, instead of asking where I'd hid it, and then finding some private sexual items; this was abnormal for her to do, so far as I know) that I’d only told a few very close friends of because it can be easily misunderstood. My mom misunderstood, and decided to tell her own false interpretation of what she found to my sister and my dad. I was pretty pissed off when she did that, since it was a very private matter and instead of confronting me about the fact that she’d invaded my privacy and trying to understand what she'd found, she spread hurtful lies to my family. My sister had a long talk with me about it, afterwards she was okay with it though she definitely didn’t understand, and my dad to this day hasn’t brought it up.

So here I am, realizing that my mom can’t be trusted with any personal details about me and me not trusting her to know what’s happening in my life. As well, I’m also now wondering what else she’s said that’s been a lie and what other details of my life she’s blabbed about to others. I’ve basically decided to keep her out of the loop until I start getting interviews, and even then I’m not sure what to do. This is the second time she’s gone behind my back and said hurtful things about me that weren’t remotely true, and it took me more than a year to stop bearing that grudge the first time. I'm becoming less comfortable about being involved with her.

I've gotten a lot of support from my SO, friends, former colleagues, former professors, my sister, and my dad. But it sucks how much one persons' opinion can make all that seem so much lesser.

**tldr**: I'm recovering from depression, quit my PhD program after a year, and I'm trying to get my career started. Job hunting is slow, just the way it is. My mom is making me feel bad that I don't have any interviews yet and passed up a job posting that, while I had a great chance of getting, probably would have made my depression worse and wouldn't further my career. She told people close to me that I was being lazy and passing up a great job offer, basically ignoring my reasoning. I get reminded of another time my mom invaded my privacy and told hurtful things to my family.

edit: My mom called me a few hours ago. She basically ignored the job posting and what she had said to everyone else; I didn't bring it up either. She asked about generic job hunting stuff and talked about my sister, whom is also going through a big life chance and isn't taking it well, both emotionally speaking and with regards to her preparation. The conversation was just off. It was basically the same thing that happened the last time I had mentioned.
