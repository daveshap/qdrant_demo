Why do recruiters think it's acceptable to be so aggressive?
 I recently made my resume visible again on a popular job search site. Almost instantaneously, I was inundated with calls, emails, and even texts from recruiters. Some would use all three methods, one right after the other. In addition, a large percentage of these recruiters would call my phone not once, but twice in a row, and some of them even called THREE times in a row. When I’d send them to voicemail, they’d just call right back a second later.

This kind of behavior is ridiculous. There is no better way to drive candidates away than to inundate them like this. In addition, I'm getting multiple recruiters contacting me for the exact same job - I'm talking upwards of 10 different recruiting companies trying to fill the same position. I can't imagine that a company would enlist 10 separate recruiting companies to fill one position, that just doesn't add up to me.
