My longest yeahboi ever
I really appreciate this subreddit. Grew up (and still am) poor and bad money management skills (ty mum). I've recently got my first full time salary job and actually having disposable money is a bit overwhelming but I'm determined to pay off all of my debts, not many, but enough to ruin my credit rating and finally start saving so when things do go to shit, I'll be kind of prepared! Thank you to this subreddit on teaching me these things.

It's wild, a year ago I was jobless, living in a very dodgy 1 bedroom apartment and no licence but now I managed to get a full-time gig, got the car I've always wanted, a mazda3, and finally moving out of my dads place next week. I never thought I'd be in this position considering my family history of Centrelink (welfare), public housing and no-one working at all but we're here. Keep your heads up m8s, things get better eventually even if you can't imagine it ever will.
