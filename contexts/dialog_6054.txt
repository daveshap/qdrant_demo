KANE: Say, Brad. I've got an idea.
LELAND: Yes?
KANE: I mean I've got a job for you.
LELAND: Good.
KANE: You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
LELAND: I'd like that.
KANE: You start tomorrow night. Richard Carl in The Spring Chicken." I'll get us some girls. You get tickets. A drama critic gets them free
LELAND: Charlie -
KANE: Yes?
LELAND: It doesn't make any difference about me, but one of these days you're going to find out that all this charm of yours won't be enough -
KANE: You're wrong. It does make a difference to you - Rector's, Brad? Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent. You won't miss anything. It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
