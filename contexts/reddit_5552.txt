Request to Mods
Can we add some rules to Jobs posts please?

I suggest that all new posts that include the OP complaining about not being able to find work, that the OP must include:

1. his/her # years relevant experience [EDITED]
2. his/her location (i.e. Los Angeles, USA; Mumbai, India)
3. Goal Industry/Career path (i.e. Oceangraphy; Space exploration; entrepreneur; retail; trucking)
