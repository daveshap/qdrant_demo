NICK: Come on out, now. He won't hurt you. Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
TANNER: No, Mr. Charles.
NICK: How did you get in here?
TANNER: I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
NICK: You worked here?
TANNER: Yes, sir. Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
NICK: Well, that's a hot one. You a bookkeeper! When were you ever a bookkeeper?
TANNER: That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing. I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
NICK: Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
TANNER: Honest, Mr, Charles. I never touched that safe. Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
NICK: Trying to put it off on her?
TANNER: Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles -- I did do a little chiseling. I come to bring it back and fix up the books. I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
NICK: You can save that and tell it to the police. They'll be here in a minute.
TANNER: Police!
