Write coordinates to new shp file columns with OGR I'm trying to get the location coordinates written to a shp file after reprojecting it.  I have shp files that are in WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) and I reproject them into UTM 13N (EPSG:27700).  I then want to add two columns and populate them with the UTM coordinates, the new projection.  I know that this is easy to do with QGIS in the attribute table but I have several files and would like to find a way to batch the process and handle several files at once so I am hoping there is an OGR method.
