JUNO: Uh, hi Su-Chin.
SU-CHIN: Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
JUNO: Good. I'm good. Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
SU-CHIN: No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
JUNO: You should try Adderall.
SU-CHIN: No thanks. I'm off pills.
JUNO: Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!""
SU-CHIN: I heard that was you.
JUNO: Well, it was nice seeing you.
SU-CHIN: Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
JUNO: Really? Fingernails?
