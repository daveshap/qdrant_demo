JACK: So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
MILES: No.
JACK: What?
MILES: It's private.
JACK: You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
MILES: Let's leave it alone.
JACK: You didn't get any, did you? You're a homo.
MILES: Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
JACK: Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
JACK: Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
MILES: Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
