JERRY: ——	As long as my feet held out.
KIKI: And not a sign of the leopard?
KIKI: Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
GALBRAITH: To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
KIKI: What do you do now?
GALBRAITH: There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
KIKI: Why did you give up teaching?
GALBRAITH: Various reasons. But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith — teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
JERRY: Show business?
GALBRAITH: Yes. It's always fascinated me. You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in Zaza." After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out."
GALBRAITH: So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
KIKI: Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
GALBRAITH: That was unfortunate.
KIKI: That was a calamity!
