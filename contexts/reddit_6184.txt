Accepted life changing job, must pass a hair follicle drug test
Hello everyone, thanks in advance for any advice given.  

I’ve accepted a position that forces me to relocate two plus hours away. Issue is, I have to pass a hair follicle drug test as part of the onboarding process. 

I was a daily smoker of cannabis, after work and weekends, never during work hours. I last smoked on October 14th. During my acceptance, I said I could be ready to go on January 6th, this was before I knew it would be a hair test as opposed to a urine test. 

I do have a plan to beat the test, and would like some advice on my plan, as well as any other advice. 

I’ll let my new employer know that the earliest I can terminate a current lease is the end of January., then I’ll need about a week to find a place, moving my start date out a month. This will be way over 90 days after I quit smoking cannabis. I should be clean by January 19th, if my math is correct. 

Do you think that will work? Or does anyone have any other advice so I can finally work my way back out of poverty.
