MRS. CALDWELL: Who the hell do you think you are?!
RONALD: Excuse me.
MRS. CALDWELL: I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
RONALD: Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
MRS. CALDWELL: Is that so?
CECILE: Where did you find those?
MRS. CALDWELL: Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
CECILE: Those are my letters!
MRS. CALDWELL: Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
RONALD: Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
MRS. CALDWELL: Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
RONALD: First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
MRS. CALDWELL: Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
RONALD: I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
