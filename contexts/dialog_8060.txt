TREVES: How long has this man been here?
FOX: Three quarters of an hour.
TREVES: Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
TREVES: Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
FOX: What a mess.
