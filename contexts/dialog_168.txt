JORDY: The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
DAPHNE: So...the station is empty?
JORDY: Yeah. This way.
JORDY: You considered becoming a prostitute?
DAPHNE: Yes, I considered it.
JORDY: Did you ever turn tricks before?
DAPHNE: No.
JORDY: What about back home?
DAPHNE: No.
DAPHNE: I came here. I had no money. I knew no one. I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money. I considered it, but... it's not who I am. They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
JORDY: So you were never a prostitute?
DAPHNE: What are you asking me?
JORDY: I'm just trying to find out who you are.
