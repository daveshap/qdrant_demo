GABRIEL: All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
ASHLEY: To all those cons...
GABRIEL: Searching for a money man...
ASHLEY: We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
GABRIEL: -- till he fucked his parole --
ASHLEY: -- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
GABRIEL: That's a book, baby. That's a book of love.
GABRIEL: I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
ASHLEY: One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
GABRIEL: I've been doing good, though.
ASHLEY: Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
GABRIEL: Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
ASHLEY: What, he should see me help you catch him?
ASHLEY: He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
GABRIEL: He'll be dead when he does.
GABRIEL: Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you...
ASHLEY: Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
RUDY: Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
MERLIN: Where the hell's Gabriel?
