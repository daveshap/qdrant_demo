Can you get another job after getting fired from a retail company?
I work for one of the biggest tech companies in the world in their corporate office. It’s only been 3 months for me and I’ve been told by a senior manager that they are thinking of firing me since they believe I’m not a good fit for the job. I’m still in probation so I’m not sure how this is going to turn out. 

Will it be difficult for me to explain in future interviews about why I was fired? I have to put this in my resume or else I’ll have a gap of 2 years without a job.
