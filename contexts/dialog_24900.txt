SHEILA: I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
THEO: Really? I kinda like it.
SHEILA: Do you talk with your mom?
THEO: It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
SHEILA: My mom told me not to stay in this town.
THEO: So why do you stay?
SHEILA: I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
THEO: I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
SHEILA: Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
THEO: I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
SHEILA: How much would you charge me for the lips?
THEO: More than you could afford.
SHEILA: Come on, bargain with me.
THEO: I could let them go for ten.
SHEILA: You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
THEO: If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
THEO: What are you going to do about your brother?
SHEILA: You're here.
THEO: What about the guy he put in the body cast?
