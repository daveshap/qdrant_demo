PAULETTE: You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
ELLE: I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
ELLE: You ready?
PAULETTE: No.
ELLE: Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this.
