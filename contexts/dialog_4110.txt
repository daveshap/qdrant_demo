DIEGO: What's the matter, George?
GEORGE: What's the matter? We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
DIEGO: A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
GEORGE: It is bad. It's chump change. We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border. We're getting screwed.
DIEGO: I know.
GEORGE: And what happens when these guys stop paying? Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out. Then where are we?
DIEGO: That's my George, always thinking.
DIEGO: This is only part of the business, George. A very small part. Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you. I must go to Colombia.
GEORGE: What is it, George? Because I have to get home. I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
DIEGO: I need you to go to Miami.
