Buy or rent textbooks for SA grad program?
I am starting a grad program for student affairs and need to order my books.  I'm on the fence between buying or renting textbooks because I've kept almost none from undergrad, but student affairs texts may be useful in a future job.  Is it worth it to purchase books?
