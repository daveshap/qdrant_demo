LITTERBUG: Yeah? So what?
O'BRIEN: So what? So what? For starters, how about littering is a crime.
LITTERBUG: Haw-haw! Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
O'BRIEN: Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
LITTERBUG: Why don't you just shove it up your ass! Haw-haw!
O'BRIEN: What is it with you litterbugs? Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
LITTERBUG: You better quit pushing me, pal.
O'BRIEN: I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug. What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
LITTERBUG: Look, asshole, I don't got time for this. If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
O'BRIEN: Oh no, no, no. No can do. You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez! You've got to learn to take responsibility!
LITTERBUG: What are you going to do? Make me throw it out?
O'BRIEN: I'll do whatever I have to do.
