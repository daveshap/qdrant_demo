NICKY: Opening night, Lillian.
LILLIAN: Who the hell cares?
NICKY: The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
LILLIAN: That's always been my problem.
NICKY: And you've been extremely patient.
LILLIAN: You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
NICKY: You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
LILLIAN: I'd forgotten that.
NICKY: I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
LILLIAN: That's very lovely actually.
NICKY: Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
LILLIAN: Be open with me. I'd like that.
NICKY: There may be things you'd rather not know about.
LILLIAN: I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
NICKY: I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
LILLIAN: Joanne Bourne.
NICKY: Alma Wetzel.
LILLIAN: Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
NICKY: I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
LILLIAN: She's my gynecologist.
NICKY: I am really, deeply sorry.
LILLIAN: It violates so many trusts.
NICKY: It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
LILLIAN: I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
NICKY: We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
LILLIAN: I'm glad we're having this talk.
NICKY: I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
