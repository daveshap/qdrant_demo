BIGGS: I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked. It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't. It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
DULANEY: So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
BIGGS: It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
DULANEY: Why?
BIGGS: Because it hasn't all been erased.
