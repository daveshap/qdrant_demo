Unemployment Question
I'm not sure if someone will be able to help with this but here we go... I filed my claim for unemployment on 3/17. After hitting 'submit' i realized that my laptop auto-filled some of the information incorrectly. My address, email (got confirmation), name, social, etc are all correct, but for my company, it filled in my personal address instead of the correct one. There's also a section for 'other company info' and of course for this section, it filled everything out correctly with my company. I feel like an idiot for not realizing this and I'm worried because I haven't received my pin in the mail and its been 13 days. 

I've never had to go through this process before and it appears that the unemployment office is overwhelmed right now. The phone number doesn't work and the live chat function is down. What should I do? Be patient or refile?
