MCCLEOD: Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
JENNIFER: No.
MCCLEOD: Why not?
JENNIFER: Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
MCCLEOD: You don't really believe this do you?
JENNIFER: Let me ask you something else. At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed. The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section. What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
MCCLEOD: So?
JENNIFER: Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern? They were wedged in tight. They couldn't get a grip on them. They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
MCCLEOD: If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
JENNIFER: Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't? What if they were trying to get out?
MCCLEOD: That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
JENNIFER: --for three hundred years.
MCCLEOD: How could that be? People don't live for three hundred years.
JENNIFER: Not unless they're immortal.
