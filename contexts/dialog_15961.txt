TONY: But... He works for your same employer?
RINALDI: Yeah, but I don't give a shit about. I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
TONY: It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon. It really isn't the usual procedure...
RINALDI: I know... But I'm a little pressed.
TONY: ...Who sent you?
RINALDI: Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
TONY: Is he still alive?
RINALDI: Yeah... And still in Messina. He's my uncle.
TONY: Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
RINALDI: No... Dino's.
