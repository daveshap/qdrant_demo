What Am I Doing Wrong?
I don’t know what I’m doing wrong with putting into jobs. The last job I had screwed me over by taking away my benefits and lying to me I could get them back and then not following through and me getting pissed and pretty much cussing out the guy in HR. Yeah that was my fault, but they also treated my like crap so getting let go was a blessing more than anything. I have since then put into about 30+ jobs for an internship through my colleges job fair as well as I have applied to many jobs that lied about their job description and wanted me to do extra jobs on top of what I paid for or lied about having to commute and do on site repairs or applying for a job and then starting me for a completely different job I didn’t even apply for. I have had such bad luck with jobs just not working out for me and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. So far I have put in over 72+ applications and haven’t heard anything back from them.
