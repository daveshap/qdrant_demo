MARION: Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed. Hide there. If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm. Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
MARGARET: But what about Thomas?
MARION: Leave him. Take care of William and Susan.
