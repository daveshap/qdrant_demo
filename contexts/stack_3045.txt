Physics mystery : why does it rotate? In the beginning this thing was floating still and the candle was out. Then someone lit the candle and the flame somehow Made the object spin on the water. See the picture.I know a little bit about thermodynamics and a bit about electromagnetism, but not the combination. Is this due to magnetism or thermodynamics or both? Does the flame change The electric field? Is it related to curie temperature and the alike? Please explain this.Also how to compute the speed of rotation? How long will it spin? How to explain classically and how modern (quantum)?I assume the properties of water relate?
