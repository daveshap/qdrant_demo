How can I learn to be grateful? I'm always finding faults in each job I work at...
So, I'd recently gotten a job in my desired field, which I am blessed to have. I guess this is just me 'nit-picking' and whatnot, but I do find myself somewhat dissatisfied if that makes sense. 

While I am grateful for the experience and lessons I can take along with me in growing as a budding professional, I find the entry position to be quite boring. I enjoy my coworkers but don't find myself to fancy my boss much. The field, however, is something I wholeheartedly enjoy and wish to further myself into. I know I'm in the right place, though I can't help but dread thinking about the start of the new week where I'll have to return and repeat all over again. I guess it's more of a dissatisfaction with both my employer and setting. 

Maintaining a strong work ethic is something I wholly pride myself for and am willing to work as long as possible before advancing to another position. Though I believe to have the ambition and discipline, I can't help but continue to focus solely on the negatives. Yeah, losing a portion of my 'freedom' is hard for almost anyone, but I mostly lament over those previously mentioned. 

How do you all get through it? I have goals and aspirations, but I know better than to rely solely on motivation. I can think of some positives; days off where I can spend time taking part in some of my favorite hobbies...earning money on a consistent basis, which will allow me to save up for a car, or a new mattress. Saving some of it and learning to invest, as I've wanted to do for quite some time...I guess that's a new start?
