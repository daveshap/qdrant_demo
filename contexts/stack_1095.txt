PostgreSQL warm standby: sync WAL files I'm new to PostgreSQL (using ver 8.4.20) and need to setup a master and standby SQL server setup.  I am planning to use warm standby setup.  I have read the docs on PG and understand the basics, but a few things aren't clear:If I use log shipping, what program is responsible for moving the logs from the master to the standby? Do I need to setup an rsync job, or does PG take care of this automatically?  If I wanted to keep control of this synchronizing (by using rsync), could I disable PG's synchronization (if such a thing exists)Assuming I need to setup an rsync job, do I sync the archive directory?  or the main PG log directory?Is it possible to combine log shipping (to cover longer outages) and streaming/SR (for record level synchronization)?  Is that a desirable thing?Is it possible to script something on the standby which tells me if it cannot sync with the master because too many old archive files are missing).  So that I can send myself an alert, or run some other script.
