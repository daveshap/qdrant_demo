A tricky question about sequences of Normal RVs Suppose I project a sum of money that will be normally distributed (e.g., tomorrow I will have some amount that is drawn from a normal population, where the mean is 100 dollars and the s.d. is 10%, or 10 dollars.)  Now, I put it in the bank.  The next year I will earn interest on it, which itself is normally distributed with mean 10% and s.d. 10% .  I am trying to predict the RV for then - after the year.The tempting thing is to look at the RV for tomorrow, which is $N(100,10)$ and say that the return has the shape $N(10%,10%)=N(10,10)$ since 10 is 10% of the expected value of 100 dollars.  But it strikes me the return RV is, to some degree, correlated with the initial amount.  For example, it's obvious after I receive the first bit that if I only get 85 dollars, then the RV for the return over the next year is distributed as $N(8.5, 8.5)$.What would the total RV actually be for the end of that second period, as calculated now?  I am simply adding two normally distributed RVs.  At times I can convince myself the two are uncorrelated; the return RV is simply being scaled by the result of the first.  At other times I convince myself the correlation is 1.0,since the return RV is a perfect slice (if you will) of the result of period 1.  But it also has a random element, so that's not quite right either.Another way to look at this is this: if the bank didn't look at my balance, but put put in two random amounts that were normally distributed with known means and s.d.s, then it would surely be just the sum of two independent RVs. But, the random amount the bank will add will, in fact, be based on the outcome of the first experiment.  So what is the nature, and how to a calculate, the expected distribution now considering the two back-to-back process that are interlinked.  My intuition tells me it is normal, but with some correlation.
