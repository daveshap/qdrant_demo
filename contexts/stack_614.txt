Change where cursor plots on startup and login I am wondering if anyone knows of a way to change the cursor plot point from center screen to an X,Y coordinate or something to a similar effect... I love Macs (as you probably noticed if you read any of my other questions since the dawn of time) and like the odd little thing with them where when they start up, the cursor is plotted in the top-left corner of the screen rather than in the centre like in every other operating system. Is there any way to accomplish this? Thanks!
