DEBORAH: Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard. It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
LOMBARD: Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
DEBORAH: That depends what you’re looking at.
LOMBARD: I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
MRS SPITZ: No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
LOMBARD: Any friends?
MRS SPITZ: The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about. His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need.
LOMBARD: I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
MRS SPITZ: When... I’m told he came here...
DEBORAH: Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn’t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
LOMBARD: And that is the last time any...
DEBORAH: Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’! Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
MRS SPITZ: The £1,000 is on account.
LOMBARD: My rates...
MRS SPITZ: We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
LOMBARD: Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
MRS SPITZ: Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
MRS SPITZ: My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
LOMBARD: Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
