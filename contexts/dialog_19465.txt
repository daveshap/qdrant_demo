ELEANOR GRANT: Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
BRENDAN GRANT: Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
ELEANOR GRANT: All right, I'll do it.
BRENDAN GRANT: That's my girl.
ELEANOR GRANT: But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
BRENDAN GRANT: Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
ELEANOR GRANT: You sent my assistant on an errand.
BRENDAN GRANT: I've been a bad boy.
