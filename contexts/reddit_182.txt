Not sure what to do
I'm a first year uni student and here's my issue. 
It takes a long time for me to understand a concept and by long I mean 5Ã— more than anyone else. This is not just for one unit it's for all. My units are simple however for some reason I just cannot understand what im learning. It takes great effort for me to study and understand something which makes it exhausting,stressful and eventually I give up since it gets too annoying to try. It's really difficult when it comes to coping with units and assessments that are ongoing. 

My educational issues;
Bad concentration
Cannot comprehend well 
Don't know how to articulate things well enough to be understood 
Forgetfull

Any advice on how to do well in my situation?
