If you can't tell if she's interested, read this.
 Women.

&nbsp;

They can be extremely frustrating to deal with when it comes to figuring out if they’re into you or not.

&nbsp;

It’s a terrible feeling to read signals wrong and make a move, only to find out she didn’t intent to come off as interested, or that she was just being nice to you. It can really hinder your ability and confidence to feel comfortable with approaching the next woman. And in some cases, it can leave a really bad taste in guy’s mouths about women in general.

&nbsp;

These things suck, and I’ve seen a healthy amount of posts asking for ways to read into women’s interest. Does she like you if she’s playing with her hair? If she’s having a conversation with you? If she likes your shirt? Where the fuck do you draw the line from friendly to interested? 

&nbsp;

Fortunately, there are subtle things women do that indicate strongly that she’s interested in you, and that you’re golden for an approach.

Generally, (because there are always expectations to the rule) women won’t come right out and tell you that they like you. It’s unfortunate, but it’s also reality in our current social climate. Women are taught to let the men pursue, let the men approach you first. Let the men ask to take you out. They’re taught that to openly pursue a man makes you look like a slut, a whore, an easy girl. And women try to avoid these types of labels.

&nbsp;

Because women are usually raised or conditioned in this manner, they don’t like taking the lead in regard to approaching. Luckily, they still like us, and they still want to help us understand when they like us. When a woman is interested in you, she’s much more likely to give hints and throw subtleties your way, hoping that you’ll pick up on what’s going on and make a move.

&nbsp;

A lot of guys will hear this and simply choose to not waste their time, which is understandable. Why put effort into a girl that can’t express how she feels?

&nbsp;

The thing about that mindset though, is that women that come right out and say “John, I really like you, and I’d like it if you took me out sometime,” are fucking rare. Very fucking rare. And if you decide to sit around and wait for that type of woman, you’ll be waiting for a *very* long time.

&nbsp;

When you don’t have the luxury of bold women approaching you, you’ve got to read the signs. And I’d like to share some valuable knowledge that **really** helped me out with knowing when a woman was genuinely interested in me, or was just being friendly or nice.

**If a woman is interested/comfortable with you, she’ll put herself in your orbit.**

&nbsp;

Now, what does this mean? 

&nbsp;

When a woman likes you, she'll go out of her way to be around you. She'll look for opportunities to touch you, speak to you, or just look at you if you're at a distance. This translates to the texting/calling game too. Have you ever had a girl you've known for a while just text you out the blue with "Hey", "Hi" or "What's up?". Secret gentlemen, she's putting herself in your orbit. She's more than likely hoping you'll take her *invitation* and turn it into a date. The simplest way to go about doing so is this. If a woman you're getting to know or dating texts/calls you, but isn't talking about anything in particular, schedule a date. She's thinking about you, and wants to see you. She probably won't come right out and say so, (I know, frustrating) but you've got to read between the lines.

**General Contact (Verbal/Texting)**

&nbsp;

Going back to putting herself in your orbit, what does this mean? Let’s say you've got someone who you work with. She seems to always greet you when you or she arrives. More interestingly, she always seems to find you, wherever you are, and say farewell when she or you leave. If a woman is constantly greeting you and wishing you well when one or both of you leave work, she's more than likely interested. Especially if she doesn't give everyone at the workplace the same kindness. She's putting herself in your orbit to make it easier for you to make a move.

&nbsp;

Women also carry out this same behavior over texts. If you receive a random text from a woman you’re dating, something along the lines of: 

&nbsp;

-	I just saw this random thing and it reminded me of you!
-	I just thought about that time we went to x!
-	Hey, what are you doing?
-	Are you doing anything today?
-	I just thought about you.
-	How are you? 

&nbsp;

She’s thinking about you. You crossed her mind, and instead of coming right out and saying, “I want to see you, ask me out,” or just asking *you* out on a date (again, frustrating, I know), she’ll put herself in your orbit, she’ll make her presence known, and hope that you understand her actions enough to realize she wants you, in some way, and should schedule a time to get together.

&nbsp;

**Physical Contact**

&nbsp;

Another way women put themselves in your orbit is through physical touch. Men, if a woman is constantly bumping/brushing up against you, she's interested. I don't care **what** anybody says. People are more than aware of their personal space. They will not consistently bump/brush up against someone that they do not find appealing, physically or in general.

&nbsp;

Likewise, if she's always touching parts of your body, again, she's interested. She's initiating the touch barrier and letting you know she's cool with physical touch. Obviously, don't lose your mind with this statement, that doesn't mean you're good to start squeezing her ass, but if a woman is touching you, it's her way to saying, "I'm okay with you being physical with me". 
&nbsp;

Again, it's more frustrating than her just saying "I'm totally down if you touched me dude", but again, woman aren't generally that forward.

**Eye Contact**

&nbsp;

Finally, eye contact. Fellas, if you’ve caught a girl staring at you for the fifteenth time, she’s interested in you. I know you may think she’s starting at something behind you, or looking at somebody that happens to be close by you, but let’s be honest here. If you’re consistently finding her gaze at you, even when you **move** locations, she’s staring at something she likes, which is you.

&nbsp;

Now, I understand eye contact can be iffy at times. So, if you’re still on the fence on whether a girl is looking at you because she’s interested, or because she’s just so disgusted with you, the next time you catch you looking, maintain eye contact for a second, and **grin**. You don’t have to full on smile if you don’t want to.

&nbsp;

If she smiles back at you, even if she averts eye contact while doing it (it’s okay, she’s nervous), she’s interested, and she wants you to approach her. If she doesn’t smile back, and looks away, sorry champ, she isn’t into it.

&nbsp;

These aren’t *all* the signs women show to express their interest in you, but they’re the basic things to look out for in you’re wanting to know if you’ve got a shot or not. Perhaps one day we’ll live in world where everyone can just be blunt and honest, without fear of rejection. But until that day, I hope this information can help you.

&nbsp;

Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! 

&nbsp;

I hear you guys loud and clear, you'd like a male version. I'll get working on it as soon as I can.
