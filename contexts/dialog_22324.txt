VALIANT: You damn Toon! No wonder they picked you for the patsy. Always gotta play the fool. You make me sick!
ROGER RABBIT: Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
VALIANT: You wanna know? Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya. One of you Toons killed my brother.
ROGER RABBIT: A Toon? Noooo.
VALIANT: Yeah, a Toon. It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
ROGER RABBIT: Him? Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
VALIANT: Yeah, everybody thought so. But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons. All Toons. We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case. But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all. We went to his house to take him in. But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
ROGER RABBIT: Safe?
VALIANT: Piano. Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown. Nobody ever saw him again.
ROGER RABBIT: I'll get it.
VALIANT: Get away from there.
ROGER RABBIT: Wrong number?
VALIANT: No, it's not.
