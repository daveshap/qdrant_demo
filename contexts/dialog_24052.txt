CHRISTY: Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
EDDIE: Not again. You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
CHRISTY: But I'm going insane! All these people do is pray and work, work and pray! I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food! Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet? Get me outta her!
EDDIE: Calm down. Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
CHRISTY: Like what?
EDDIE: Keeping our witnesses alive. We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
CHRISTY: You son-of-a-bitch!
EDDIE: I just need a few more weeks,
CHRISTY: But it's a nightmare! Mother Superior is out to get me! She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
CHRISTY: Do you hear that? That choir? Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
EDDIE: Don't call again. It's not safe. I'll be in touch.
