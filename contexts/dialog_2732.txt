CHEVALIER: Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
PRUSSIAN OFFICER: I will let down the steps for your honor.
CHEVALIER: Good gracious! What is this?
PRUSSIAN OFFICER: You are going to drive to the frontier.
CHEVALIER: It is shameful -- infamous! I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
PRUSSIAN OFFICER: I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
CHEVALIER: Ten thousand? But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
PRUSSIAN OFFICER: Your honor must lower his voice.
CHEVALIER: All Europe shall hear of this!
PRUSSIAN OFFICER: As you please.
