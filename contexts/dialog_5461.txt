THEO: Say something ...
CAITLIN: Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
THEO: I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
CAITLIN: He's at it again. Like that night at the Emerald. This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall. Meantime Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out. It took six stitches."
THEO: How was I in the wrong?
CAITLIN: Be careful. There were people in that crosswalk.
KLINGER: That's all we need. Better let me drive.
THEO: I'm fine. She's back on. Hello? I'm here.
LENORE: They just walked out. The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound. It's starting to hurt now -- real bad. A throbbing. I can't even take a deep breath.
THEO: Don't move around. You don't want to puncture a lung.
CAITLIN: Was someone in an accident?
LENORE: Do I hear a woman's voice?
THEO: I'm with two friends now.
LENORE: Rachel! They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
THEO: Stop throwing names at me.
LENORE: Rachel, my daughter. She's an honor student at Parker. My God, she's only nine.
THEO: What do they need her for?
LENORE: They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
THEO: Bottom line! There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
KLINGER: What do you mean tip the cops? Is the man a lunatic or what?
THEO: Will you relax? This in no way affects our business. Go on.
LENORE: The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school. Rachel will recognize the car. She'll get right in.
THEO: Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
LENORE: They don't know you. They won't listen.
