NICKY: The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
ANGEL: Maybe try the opposite of that.
ANGEL: Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
NICKY: My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
ANGEL: A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
NICKY: My mom wasn't a goat?
ANGEL: Try an angel.
NICKY: An angel?
ANGEL: Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
NICKY: Wow. What... what did she look like?
ANGEL: Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
