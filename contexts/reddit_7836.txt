Those in their first year trying to find an advisor: how is your program handling spring rotations?
Incoming first year in biology here! The admins of my future program have told us that if the campus is shut down for the fall term, first years would have to do a virtual rotation. 

My type of research is very hands-on and bench-necessary, so I’m concerned about my performance and ability in the case of having to work from home in a brand new research focus. 

How have your programs (particularly for experimental scientists, but please jump in even if you’re in a different kind of program!) been handling this, and how do they expect to handle a possible closure in the fall?

Thanks ❤️
