What is the game's tech progression? In Subnautica, the primary method of progression is by scanning broken pieces of equipment that are lying scattered on the ocean floor. This unlocks various tech upgrades, which allow you to explore more and more of the map.The game starts you off in the Safe Shallows biome, in which you can find some useful tech such as the Seaglide. However, I'm not sure where to go next. The next logical step seems to be to either the Kelp Forest or Grassy Plateaus, to find the Seamoth parts. After that I'm at a loss though. Do I head straight to the Aurora to fix the radiation? Underwater islands for Cyclops parts? It doesn't feel like the game gives you a lot of direction, and considering the massive dangers of swimming in unknown territory... well, let's say I'd prefer to avoid any encounters with Reaper Leviathans for as long as I can.
