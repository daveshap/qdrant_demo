CARLOS: Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
WALTER: Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
CARLOS: C'mon, Walter.
WALTER: You should see my appointment book. It got crazy.
CARLOS: It's not what you think.
WALTER: Isn't it?
CARLOS: The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
WALTER: I'm not a monster.
CARLOS: You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
WALTER: Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
CARLOS: Don't talk like that.
