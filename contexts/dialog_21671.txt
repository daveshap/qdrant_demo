RENEE PELAGIE: Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
THE MARQUIS: It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
RENEE PELAGIE: Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
THE MARQUIS: Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
RENEE PELAGIE: He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
THE MARQUIS: It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
