Need to understand the process of gaining secret clearance (US)
I just got a job offer where the employer will sponsor me getting a secret level clearance.  I've heard it can take 6 months, other sources say up to 24 months.  The issue is they dropped the compensation when they gave me the offer and won't go back up to what we discussed when I started interviewing with them.  A secret clearance would add to my ability to get other jobs in the future, so this alone has value.  I'm thinking I could work for this company, initiate the process for a secret level clearance, and potentially leave soon after for a better paying job.  My question is whether this would end the process of me receiving the secret level clearance.
