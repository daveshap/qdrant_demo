M: It’s a message. He wants us to know he’s back.
BOND: Who?
M: Claude Serrault. A.K.A...
BOND: Renard.
M: Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me. I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
BOND: Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
M: How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I’d do the same again.
