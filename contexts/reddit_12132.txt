So Many little things are adding up
First my friend from work announces she's found another job and will be leaving, the same time as another work friend is leaving, meaning soon I won't have any work friends left. Next my sister tells me she doesn't want me to come to her bachelorette party because "she won't feel comfortable and will be worrying about me." She is planning a weekend trip to a cool city I've never been to with 10 girls and I was really looking forward to it.  I'm feeling a lot of pressure at work from my boss to be more productive so I've been working late most days. When I ask co-workers for help I feel like I'm annoying them. Today I asked a co-worker for his opinion on an issue I was having, and he snapped at me and told me I was stupid and making things harder than they needed to be. I turned bright red and my eyes were welling up for the rest of the day. I tried to vent to my mom about how I've been feeling, and she snapped at me and told me I only make her stressed and she has too much going on to deal with me. I feel like an embarrassment and a burden to everyone in my life.
