Weird recruiter linked in message
 I got this message on linked in from a recruiter. The guy seems to have a legit profile. I am just weirded out by the "very confidential" and "quietly be considered" lines. Is this legit?

Your name came up regarding your experience in relation to a very confidential search I am doing for one of our best clients. They are seeking a high performer looking to take their career to the next level by becoming their technical services expert for this growing company. If you would like to very quietly be considered, or would just be curious to learn more, please reply to this email or contact me at
