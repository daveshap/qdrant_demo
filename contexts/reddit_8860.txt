Is there historical precedent for a gag order remaining in place following sentencing in a trial?
The sentencing phase of the Roger Stone trial has just finished.  During the trial there was a gag order placed on Roger Stone after some notable outbursts.  My understanding of a gag order is that it prevents "pollution" of or interference with the jury.  Now that the jury work is complete, however the gag order remains.

For all I know this happens all the time, but it does seem weird.

>U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson took Barr’s recommendation of 40 months in sentencing the president’s longtime friend. She also fined Stone $20,000 and continued a gag order, prohibiting Stone from speaking about the case.

For those who haven't been following, Stone was a campaign adviser to Trump in the 2016 campaign.  He was found guilty of making false statement to the House Intelligence Committee and to witness intimidation.  Early in the trial, Stone was placed under a gag order that included social media.  Now that the trial and sentencing is done, this gag is still in place.
