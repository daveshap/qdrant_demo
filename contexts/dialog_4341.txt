ROBERT: Can I help?
FRANCESCA: Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
ROBERT: How about if I set the table?
FRANCESCA: Sure.
ROBERT: Would you like a beer for your bath?
FRANCESCA: Yes, that'd be nice.
