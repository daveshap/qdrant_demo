Why did she do this?
Ok im a 17 yo guy and in my junior year of High School. I am by no means popular, but I have my group of friends that I usually hang out with, but recently I met a couple of new people a grade under me. This one girl I never really gave a second thought about asked me out to see a movie. I was really surprised- I don't consider myself very good looking, I'm not popular and I can't really make conversation- so this would be my third official date. Anyway, I don't assume anything, up to the movie I'm reserved, don't make any moves besides paying for her ticket, thinking it could just be a 'movie with a friend' to her. Bout halfway through movie, she reaches over for my hand, eventually lays her head on my shoulder, movie continues with various levels of hand holding ect. Head to her home for dinner with her parents, we end up hanging out, and watching Tv, her laying on top of me on the couch. Great evening, happiest i've felt in two years. Depression = gone. Next couple days, wont return my texts except for little one word answers, eventually updates her Facebook status as in a relationship with her EX, that she broke up with two weeks ago. Killed me, almost literally. "Hey u/danyguy201, whats up?" Her excuse- she actually didn't want to be with me but didn't have a way to say it, she didn't mean to have me fall for her. Soooooo, here I am again stuck in a deeper depression, trying to find solace in the internet. Please someone explain why it's ok to play with a vulnerable guy's feelings like this. I never asked for anything, I never made a move, and so she just left me by the wayside.
