CARDENAS: What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
ROSTON: She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her. My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that. You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her. How deeply you want to please her. At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built. Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop. Eventually I started to have trouble breathing. Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster. No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
CARDENAS: If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
ROSTON: I couldn't help myself. You get lost inside a women like her. It was like a drug. It was the best sex I ever had.
CARDENAS: What happened after that?
ROSTON: I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
CARDENAS: Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
ROSTON: Yes.
CARDENAS: Who was your primary beneficiary?
ROSTON: She was.
CARDENAS: Thank you. The State rests.
