RAY: You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
SPANKY: But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
RAY: Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
