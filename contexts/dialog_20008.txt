BETTY: ...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
CHARLIE: No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
CHARLIE: Do you know who I am?
BETTY: ...I... I know what you are.
CHARLIE: Do you know why I'm here?
BETTY: I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
CHARLIE: You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
BETTY: I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
CHARLIE: So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify? Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
BETTY: Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
CHARLIE: Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
BETTY: ...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
CHARLIE: ...to see you.
