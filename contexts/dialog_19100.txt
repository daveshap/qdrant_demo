NAPOLEON: Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
BERTRAND: It is a terrible shock.
NAPOLEON: But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
BERTRAND: I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
NAPOLEON: She should have had Larrey or Corvisart. They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me? Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper? How incredible!
BERTRAND: That is incredible.
NAPOLEON: Ah, my poor Josephine. She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world. She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
BERTRAND: I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
NAPOLEON: I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I? She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
