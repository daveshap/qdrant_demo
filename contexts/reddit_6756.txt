I've never worked with recruiters or staffing agencies before. What are the gotchas I should watch out for?
I heard recruiters get a portion of your salary, but that might be confused with their commission which is separate from your salary? I guess that's question #1: how does that actually work?

I also heard there are cases where you are technically working for the recruiter/staffing company and they take a cut of your salary. Is that a thing or more misinformation?

Is there any reason not to work with recruiters/staffers? What's the difference between them anyway?

I'm mostly asking because I saw what looks to be the exact same job posted by 5 companies on LinkedIn and it seems they're all recruiters/staffing firms trying to fill one position. If I could figure out who was actually hiring, would it be better to go through them or is there an advantage to going recruiter/staffing instead?
