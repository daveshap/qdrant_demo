What is currently known regarding the classified intelligence memo at the center of this social media #releasethememo movement?
It is difficult to provide neutral sources on this as it is currently being reported by a majority of right-leaning websites.  [Here](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/release-the-memo-republicans-demand-release-of-private-memo-containing-revelations-worse-than-a3744111.html) is a lightly detailed story from the UK Evening Standard. 

My main question is what is actually known at this point, and should there be cause for concern with the hyperbole surrounding this issue?  

Edited to conform to sub posting standards (thanks mod team for the guidance!).
