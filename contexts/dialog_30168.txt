KOBAYASHI: My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
KEATON: Who's your boss?
KOBAYASHI: My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
KEATON: Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
KOBAYASHI: I work for Keyser Sate.
KEATON: What is this?
VERBAL: Who's Keyser Soze?
