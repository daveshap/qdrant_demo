The question to end all questions: NASPA or ACPA or ACUHO-I?
Question: Which professional organization should I join/get involved with?

Background: I'm a new-professional looking to build knowledge and get involved. I work at a Regional State University in ResLife in New England and not many of my colleagues are involved regionally and it's tough feeling connected. I am a former ACPA member (I let it run out) and was involved with SEAHO (but no longer in that region).  I am also job-searching.

Goals: I want to continue to working in Housing/ResLife with a focus on Living-Learing Programs.  In the foreseeable future I'd like to begin my Ph.D. program focusing on the History of Higher Ed and Policy and Law.

I'm just looking for some guidance(s) in the area so any thought, personal experiences, and input are greatly appreciated, as are any debates on the merit or orgs.
