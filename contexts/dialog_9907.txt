FRANCES: Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
HARRY: Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
FRANCES: No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
HARRY: Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
FRANCES: You know something, Harry?
HARRY: I guess.
FRANCES: Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
HARRY: What's that?
FRANCES: You can't drink.
FRANCES: Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
HARRY: Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
FRANCES: What a man!
HARRY: Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
FRANCES: To quarter-horses.
HARRY: No. To thoroughbreds.
