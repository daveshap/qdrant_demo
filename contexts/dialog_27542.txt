JOHANA: Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
DUFFY: What d'you mean?
JOHANA: The mafia! La Cosa Nostra!
DUFFY: What's happened??
JOHANA: The documents are forged.
DUFFY: No!
JOHANA: Yes! The notary is a phony. He has the same signature as the contractor!
DUFFY: It can't be true!
JOHANA: We have to send somebody over there immediately! If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook. There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
DUFFY: I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
JOHANA: I tried him, he can't go. His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
DUFFY: I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
JOHANA: Italian is practically the same thing.
