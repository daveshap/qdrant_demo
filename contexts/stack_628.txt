Ubuntu install error message I am currently running Windows 10 and would like to install Ubuntu as it is much more convenient than Windows for coding Ruby On Rails. Though I am not sure how to do it properly.My setup: One 256GB SSD with Windows boot on itOne 3 TB HD where I store files (music ...) and also some large Windows install (Steam and games mostly) I thought I could dedicate a partition on the 3TB HD drive to Ubuntu so I created a partition of 500 GB on this drive.Now Ubuntu install I wanted to install on the 500GB partition so i selected \" something else\" Then highlighted my 500 GB partition. but got error : \"No root file system is defined\" then I went back to install location menu and selected \" install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager\" and it offers to create the install on the 256 GB SSD drive and call it \"Ubuntu /dev/sdb6 (ext4)\"So my question : is it necessary to install it on the SSD drive ? There is only 100GB free on this drive and the proposed Ubuntu partition is 61 GB. I am not sure there will be enough left for swap.. Is it not possible to use the 500 GB partition even if it's not fast access ? (I have 32 GO ram so it may be only slightly low at start)
