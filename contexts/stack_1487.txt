Powering inverter gate needed for enabling a DC-DC converter I'm designing a plugin card that's powered at 12V from the main board. Now, I need a 3V3 and a 2V5 voltages on the card, so I'm using two buck converters MUN12AD03-SH (I'm supposed to use this specific converter, so I can't change that).The signal for enabling the converters comes from the main board and is active-low  (I can't change that as well), while this the converter's enable is active-high, therefore I'll have to use an inverter gate.So the question is what's the wisest way to power this inverter gate if the DC-DC converters aren't enabled yet (only have 12V)? I wasn't able to find a 12V tolerant inverter gate. Can I use a voltage divider as the inverter gate won't draw big currents? Or should I use another buck or LDO or something else?
