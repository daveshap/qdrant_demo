SARA'S VOICE: Are you there to not reconcile with her?
SARA'S VOICE: Goodbye, Grady.
GRADY: No. Sara, you don't understand...
SARA'S VOICE: Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
GRADY: Yea?
SARA'S VOICE: How you choose to live your own life is your business. But you be careful with that boy, Grady. With James. He belongs to somebody else.
