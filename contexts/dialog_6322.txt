SALESGIRL: I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
JAKE: You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
SALESGIRL: What was it?
JAKE: A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
SALESGIRL: That's no problem. We have those in stock.
JAKE: Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
SALESGIRL: With identification.
JAKE: I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..?
SALESGIRL: I'm sorry.
JAKE: I know it's policy, but... The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
SALESGIRL: I'm sorry.
JAKE: This is embarrassing.
