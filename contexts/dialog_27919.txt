KIKI: Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
JERRY: Yeah.
KIKI: And did you find the leopard?
KIKI: It must be the altitude —— you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot—and—saddle boys --
JERRY: The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
KIKI: Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
JERRY: Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
KIKI: Who is he?
JERRY: You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
