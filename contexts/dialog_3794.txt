WHISTLER: The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control. The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
KAREN: No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
WHISTLER: Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience.
