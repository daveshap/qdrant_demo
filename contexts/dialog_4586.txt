CAESAR: Got to think this through ...
VIOLET: Caesar, maybe we should run --
CAESAR: Violet, please!
VIOLET: I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
CAESAR: Goddammit, Violet! Would you just leave me the fuck alone! Please! Leave! Now!
VIOLET: All right, Caesar.
VIOLET: It's me.
CORKY: What happened?
VIOLET: He totally freaked. I've never seen him like this. He's out of his fucking mind.
CORKY: That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
VIOLET: Believes it! Jesus, it's driving him crazy. He wants to kill him. I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do. I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
CORKY: It's all right, Violet. It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
VIOLET: What if he doesn't run?
CORKY: That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
VIOLET: Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
CORKY: Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it. You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
VIOLET: okay, all right.
CORKY: We're almost there, Violet. just hang on.
