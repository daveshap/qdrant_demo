YORGI: Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
XANDER: What's Anarchy 99"?"
YORGI: It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
XANDER: You wanna see my politics?
XANDER: Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
YORGI: That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
YORGI: To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: America stands for freedom
XANDER: ...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals."
YORGI: You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
XANDER: How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
YORGI: Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
