BARON: Chasing around.
FLAEMMCHEN: Chasing what?
BARON: Money.
FLAEMMCHEN: You were very different yesterday.
BARON: Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
KRINGELEIN: What, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
KRINGELEIN: I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
DOCTOR: You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
KRINGELEIN: Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
DOCTOR: I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
KRINGELEIN: Everything?
DOCTOR: I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years. I've been everything.
FLAEMMCHEN: That was lovely.
BARON: Will you do me a big favor?
FLAEMMCHEN: I'll do anything for you.
BARON: Would you like to make a man happy?
FLAEMMCHEN: Yes -- I'd love to.
BARON: Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
FLAEMMCHEN: Why?
BARON: I feel sorry for him.
FLAEMMCHEN: You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
BARON: I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
FLAEMMCHEN: Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
BARON: I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
FLAEMMCHEN: Anything for you.
PREYSING: Miss Flaemm.
FLAEMMCHEN: Hello!
PREYSING: I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
FLAEMMCHEN: Presently, Mr. Preysing.
PREYSING: It's urgent.
BARON: Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
PREYSING: Insolent -- Berlin manners.
KRINGELEIN: I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
PREYSING: I don't know you.
KRINGELEIN: Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
FLAEMMCHEN: Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
PREYSING: I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
FLAEMMCHEN: Tomorrow morning.
PREYSING: No -- now.
FLAEMMCHEN: Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
PREYSING: Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
KRINGELEIN: I could not think of not accepting.
PREYSING: You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
FLAEMMCHEN: Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance.
PREYSING: I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
BARON: Oh, let the poor devil alone.
PREYSING: I did not ask your advice.
BARON: I think it would be much better if you went away.
PREYSING: We shall see who remains here the longer.
BARON: As you will.
FLAEMMCHEN: You must look at my face and not at the floor.
KRINGELEIN: Yes.
FLAEMMCHEN: You're trembling.
KRINGELEIN: I never danced before -- in public.
FLAEMMCHEN: You dance splendidly.
KRINGELEIN: I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
FLAEMMCHEN: Really?
KRINGELEIN: For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
