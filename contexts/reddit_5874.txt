Is it bad to just get an Associates Degree?
 Hello,

I am 18 and currently attend a community college and only plan to do the needed two years to earn my Associates Degree, and not transfer to do a Bachelor's.

Is it bad to just have an Associates Degree? Can I still get into good paying jobs with two years? How much does GPA really matter with a 2 year degree?

My reasoning:

Firstly, I have extremely severe issues focusing on studies (will be getting diagnosed by a doctor in the next few weeks, I believe I have very strong ADD) This is the majority of the reason why I do not want to do two more years.

I am ***not*** saying the following to "flex" (so please do NOT say that in the comments thank you!!), but to give more context upon my situation.

I am not in a desperate need for money, I am fortunate enough to own two vehicles and soon my own place to live all which my parents have graciously provided me (I am very fortunate I know). They cover a majority of the needed costs + I have a delivery driving job that I make decent pay from. Possibly after a year or two of being moved in I plan to get a roommate to pay me rent so that will be an extra source of income.

Of course I want to be successful on my own, this is my reason for attending college in the first place. I try my very hardest, but end up with a C average.

Planning to go into business or marketing or IT. My goal is to eventually start up my own car customization shop.

Thank You for reading, Again please no trashtalking me for having all this stuff given to me. I already deal with that criticism IRL and do not need it here. I never have begged my parents for anything, there goals are simply to give there son an easier life, since most of their life was very rough.
