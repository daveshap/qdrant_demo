MARIE-LOUISE: Do you like music?
NAPOLEON: Yes, I do -- very much.
MARIE-LOUISE: Will I be able to play the harp? It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
NAPOLEON: Of course, my dear.
MARIE-LOUISE: You are so good to me. Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
NAPOLEON: You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
MARIE-LOUISE: I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views. I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
NAPOLEON: I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
MARIE-LOUISE: I hope you have patience with me. I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
NAPOLEON: I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
MARIE-LOUISE: Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here? I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
NAPOLEON: Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her. And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
MARIE-LOUISE: Oh, no, I am very happy. But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know. And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
NAPOLEON: Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
MARIE-LOUISE: Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
NAPOLEON: Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything. I will teach you everything that you must know.
NAPOLEON: Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
MARIE-LOUISE: No.
NAPOLEON: Well, two nice little Swiss boys, who are virgins, decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello.
