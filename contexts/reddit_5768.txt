Feeling even more depressed after getting constantly rejected
I’m going to sound really pathetic right now but I’m 25 years old with no job experience whatsoever. My brother started working at Dunkin Donut when he was 16 or 17 years old, but even as a teenager I did not try to find a job. Why? Because I was so stupid and lazy and it’s coming back to bite me and I feel so embarrassed and ashamed. This semester, I’m taking a break from university because my depression got severe and I needed to get counseling. I promised myself I will work on myself more including taking care of my physical health and finding a part time job so I can gain experience as well as contribute just even a tiny bit for my family’s financial issue. Since, May I have applied to many different jobs. Only one called me back for an interview and even then I totally messed up during the interview because I got scared and couldn’t think of a good answer immediately. I totally blame myself for the situation I am in right now. On my resume, I wrote down other things that could be helpful like having a research position at school, having leadership position at clubs, having experience with customer service through volunteering at the hospital’s store. I also created a blog for one of the biggest Asian entertainment website and tried to talk about my experience with public relations. But my work experience is totally blank and I continuously get rejected. I tried to keep positive and keep applying but after getting rejected so many times, I feel like I’m not good enough for anything. And why should I be? There are far better people with more experiences than me so I totally get why I’m not getting anything. How can I improve myself? What steps can I continue to take?
