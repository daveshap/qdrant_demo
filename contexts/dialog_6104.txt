IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
DANTE: I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: You calling me a liar?
DANTE: No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
DANTE: Actually, that's his night job.
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work. I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch. You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
DANTE: If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER: Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
