SHEA: Where did you find this?
WILL: It was nailed to the cellar wall.
SHEA: I see some faint lettering. It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
WILL: Runic?
SHEA: I'm not sure, but I can check. Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
MAURA: Before.
SHEA: Do you mind if I borrow it?
WILL: Not at all, if it can help.
AMY: Damn it.
SHEA: What's the matter?
AMY: These records only go back to 1880. But... ...wait a minute...
SHEA: Did you find something?
AMY: I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster. They had a daughter. Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
