I couldn't decide whether my advisor asking my permission or she is being considerete before giving my project to another student.
Hello everyone, I recently have been approached by my advisor about a certain project and she wants to give it to another graduate student in our lab. They talked it between them and my advisor said she would ask me first.  

For a little context, We are an evolutionary genetics lab. My research is more on the mechanistic side as I am curious about what factors effect meiosis and oogenesis in the most broad sense. but We had an idea day and she asked us to think projects or rather ideas and we can start to shapen up the chapters in our dissertation. So there was a bit literature research on my part but I came up with a project on transposable elements. That idea is more bioinformatics and different from what I am doing right now. My advisor helped me to develop this idea. She suggested a few things to make it more interesting. I did some reaserch on it. And I decided to postpone it for a while as there were more prominent experiments going on. 

Now it is almost a year after that "idea day" I did little on that particular project but there is a preliminary analysis and I found a program to work with. but so far everyone thought as that project was my brain child. My advisor recently wanted to talked to me about this project and she asked if I consider giving it to the other graduate student. As she is considering to switch from master's to PhD and she is interested in bioinformatics aspect of the projects. I obviously don't want to but couldn't help but wonder if she was asking it out of curtesy and I guess we don't own ideas or projects at this moments. 

Also for the timeline both of us plan to work around a similar time and my advisor said there wasn't ant rush on her part to finish it. I feel like I am pressured into giving up.
