Depression interfering with studying. Mind keeps jumping back and forth between "gotta study this now" and "there's no use, even if I max out my life and potential, there's still no use". What are some tangible things you can do in this exact moment to rally the mind 100% behind studying?
Rally as in " (of troops) come together again in order to continue fighting after a defeat or dispersion.

"De Montfort's troops rallied and drove back the king's infantry""

Feels like some of the mind keeps wanting to give up and kill myself. And some wants to study. And trying to rally it all behind studying without these suicidal thoughts distracting me from studying.
