Does anybody else crave a day home alone, but your anxiety/depressions also gets worse home alone?
Iâ€™m sorry for that horribly constructed sentence. Iâ€™m a weird split between extroverted and introverted, but I LOVE having a day or two to myself to just do whatever Iâ€™d like in the comfort of my cozy home. However, my anxiety makes it SO hard to do that sometimes, and the guilt of doing â€˜relaxingâ€™ things when I should be doing other things, and my lack of ability to concentrate, my angry thoughts, all tend to sweep up that day full of potential and curb stomp it on the ground. I end up crying, getting nothing done, and also not being able to relax, so then Iâ€™ve wasted a day and now I feel 100x worse about myself. 

Does this happen to anyone else? 

EDIT: Thank you all for your replies. It definitely makes me feel less alone in all this. You guys are the best. ðŸ’—
