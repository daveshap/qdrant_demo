Exercise... seriously, do it.
I have battled anxiety for nearly ten years now. I’ve been on and off antidepressants (been off almost two years). Over the years I have used CBT, therapy, and mindfulness meditation to reduce my anxiety with moderate success, but I still “slip” a lot and it can come back with a vengeance sometimes. 

I recently kind of “stumbled” into exercise. I used to hate it and dread it as nothing more than a means to burning calories and eventually losing weight. But after reading a ton on how it can help anxiety and depression (which I’ve known for years) I casually just said “Ok what the heck?”. Lots of people take medicine everyday for anxiety, why can’t I try this as a form of medicine? 

So for the last week, my husband and I have been waking up at five to work out before work (I’ve learned that it NEVER happens after because I’m a teacher and I get exhausted at work). The results? AMAZING. I have felt more at ease in the last week than I have in years. I only work out for thirty minutes and I do a variety of strength and cardio. The type of exercise does not seem to have any effect on the amount of relief. Even just a brisk walk can do it. I can not recommend it enough. Don’t wait to try it like I did. Seriously. A doctor gave me this advice years ago and I wish I would have listened. Go get your CDC-recommended 150 minutes a week and see what it does for your anxiety. I think you will be amazed.
