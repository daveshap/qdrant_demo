REYNARD: Yes, Mr. Dowd.
EDDIE: Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
REYNARD: If I were sitting where I normally sit, I would say Calls for speculation.""
EDDIE: Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
REYNARD: Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
EDDIE: And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
REYNARD: Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
EDDIE: The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
REYNARD: In those days, they often worked as a team.
EDDIE: And who was Arturo Esparza?
REYNARD: I don't think I know that name.
EDDIE: -- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
REYNARD: I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
EDDIE: I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
REYNARD: You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
EDDIE: Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
REYNARD: I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
EDDIE: I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
