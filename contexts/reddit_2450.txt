25y/o homeless disabled single mom, college dropout, dumpster fire work history. Can I still be a lawyer and if so, how do I even begin to work on this goal?
I dropped out of college a semester before graduating. Otherwise, I was a successful student on track to graduate with a dual degree BS/BA in Geography and International Relations, respectively, that following Spring.

I worked in direct services/social work, mostly really grimey, poorly paid, street outreach with the homeless. Hard work, long hours, lots of hearing people's traumas, so much stress. Really hated it. I bounced between jobs a lot. Some of it was my fault, some of it wasn't. I really wasn't great at it. I don't think I have any possible references.

Yada yada yada, I'm now a homeless single mom living of of SSI and food stamps, no family or friends to support me. Honestly, it sucks. It really sucks. I just want to be able to make a living wage and be able to afford a home. I don't even know how to hodgepodge together anything and I just feel so lost. My dream would be to become a civil rights lawyer, but I can't see a path to that. I feel very hopeless and am open to any ideas to move forward with my life.
