How to design filter for inverter for following cases? I am going to make two pure sine inverters for collage project.Both inverter uses 24V battery as DC voltage source. Switched to ~360Vdc and ~180Vd by boost converter accordingly.Both then switched by IGBT full H-bridge circuit to SPWM AC. There is control circuit which has output od modulated sine wave(50Hz and 60Hz) with 20kHz carrier frequency. This controller drives the H-bridge.At this point everything works perfectly fine as expected. But now to get a proper sine wave instead of a SPWM wave, i need to add filter circuit.I am not sure how to design filter.Some of suggestions i got from experts that you need a low-pass filter to filter the 20kHz. But dont know how to design one.How to select L and C values? Is there any equations or calculation for this? Which topology should i use? Does hormonics removed completely by adding low-pass filter?Case 1:I/p voltage: 360 VdcOutput voltage: 250 Vrms@50HzOutput current: 5Amp maxTotal power: ~1250VA maxCase 2:I/p voltage: 180 VdcOutput voltage: 120 Vrms@60HzOutput current: 8Amp maxTotal power: ~1000maxThank you for help me. Please correct me if i am wrong and assume appropriate parameters/values if i missed to describe.
