Feeling so depressed to the point where I'm contemplating calling out of work (again) tomorrow to get real help.
I'm struggling pretty hard right now with depression and anxiety. I could barely do anything today with how fatigued I am. My insurance is also running out on the 31st. I know I need to take time to figure out what's going on, but at the same time I can't afford to lose my job if I need time away. I just need support right now. My energy is nonexistent.
