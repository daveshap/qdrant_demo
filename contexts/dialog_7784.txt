JESSICA: MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
MS. HELLER: I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
JESSICA: Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
MS. HELLER: Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce. Well, I see you have a camera.
JESSICA: So can I come along?
MS. HELLER: No.
JESSICA: Are you wearing a coconut bra?
MS. HELLER: Oh, you're good.
JESSICA: Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
MS. HELLER: Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
JESSICA: You mean the lunch room?
