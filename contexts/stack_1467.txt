How can I split a 5v power supply into 4 isolated (no shared ground or live) channels? I need to power a number of tp4056's with the battery outputs in series (using tp4056's because I have a bunch already, and because I want to be able to add more cells in series later).  If I do this normally It will short out the cells so my options are to either charge in parallel then have a 4-6pdt switch that can take >5 amps of current (pretty damn hard to find and wouldn't allow usage and charging at the same time, or as I saw in a tutorial use isolation on multiple tp4056's with some B0505S IC's.  These apparently cannot take alot of current and I would like to charge quickly so I need another option. -edit: I may be an idiot but I just thought about the fact that I could just use two B0505S 's in parallel for each battery and charger.
