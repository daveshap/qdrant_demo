TASLIMA: They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again. Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
PLISSKEN: No screamin' shit.
TASLIMA: Oh no, it's the Doctor.
PLISSKEN: Who?
TASLIMA: The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
