WALLY: Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering... Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
HOMER: Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
WALLY: You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
HOMER: Well, sure... that's good, then. All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
WALLY: I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
