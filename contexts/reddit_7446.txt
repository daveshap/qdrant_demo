Private loan lenders for a graduate CERTIFICATE program
Hi all,

Running into way too many headaches trying to find a private loan that I can take out for my graduate certificate program. I am enrolled in a graduate certificate program at Penn State (6 credits in the summer, 6 credits in the fall) and am having the worst of luck trying to find a private loan company to help pay for it. My credit rating and ability to pay for the loan is not an issue at all. FAFSA won't cover the certificate program. The issue is that very few private lenders will approve of a loan that is non-degree seeking i.e. a certificate. I had no idea this was a barrier to obtain a private loan for my schooling, but I imagine plenty of other certificate seekers have encountered this strange gray area as well.

I was approved for my loan at Sallie Mae, but didn't finalize it because of their repayments options (they were only offering 5 or 6-year repayments plans). Worst case scenario, I will go with their option, but I (and my fianc√©) am still paying off our federal and Parent-PLUS loans from our undergrad degrees and I am trying to keep my monthly payments low for this certificate program.

I tried loans through College Ave and New Hampshire Higher Education with no luck. After speaking with people on the phone from those companies who said they DO give loans to non-degree seeking students, I find out via email a week later from the university that it is not the case. Just extremely frustrating. I understand why so many people just give up on the whole "going to college" process, because it can be very time-consuming and exhausting just trying to figure out how to pay for it.

Any recommendations for private loan lenders out there for a non-degree seeking program?

Thank you!
