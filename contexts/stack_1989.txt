Best way to rephrase the sentence (if needed) I'm not sure if this is a correct section for this.After writing and reviewing my sentence multiple times, I ended up with following:<blockquote>  And yet, instead of succumbing to a fit of uncontrollable panic, I was feeling serene.</blockquote>To me, the above example sounds a bit weird. But I'm not a native language user, so it might me because of that.Is there any way I should restructure that sentence, or is it fine as is?Please let me know if I need to provide more context.
