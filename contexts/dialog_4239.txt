CARDENAS: Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney John Cardenas. You arrived at what time tonight?
JOANNE: A little after eleven.
CARDENAS: Why did you come by?
JOANNE: I had some papers to pick up.
CARDENAS: Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
JOANNE: I assume his girlfriend.
CARDENAS: Her name?
JOANNE: Rebecca Lawson.
CARDENAS: You wouldn't know her address, would you?
JOANNE: No -- but I can get it for you.
CARDENAS: Thank you.
MCCURDY: Marsh wasn't alone. We found traces of sperm on the sheets. The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
CARDENAS: What'd he die of?
MCCURDY: The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
CARDENAS: The official cause?
MCCURDY: That's what my report will read.
CARDENAS: But there's more?
