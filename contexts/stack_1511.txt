Multimeter shows OL or 0.00 or 1.00. What's wrong? I've got a UNI-T UT33D multimeter that's not working like I want it to, and I'm not sure how to find out what's wrong or if it's salvageable or not. The unit is new, but may possibly have had its battery inserted backwards at some point.I've tried it with two three different batteries, two of which seem healthy when measured by another multimeter, and the third one being new from the store.Resistance readings I can get are as follows:Setting | open | shorted200M | OL. | OL.20M | -0.00 | 1.00 -- battery indication for both200k | -00.0 | 10.0 -- batt. ind. for both20k | -0.00 | 1.00 -- batt. ind. for both2000 | -000 | OL -- batt. ind. for both200 | OL. | OL. and batt. ind.There have been times when the shorted readings have been 243, 24.3 and 2.43 instead.Voltage readings for 20V and 200V DC on a healthy 9V battery are OL and battery indicator.All of the above readings are taken with black lead in COM and red lead in the fused connection.I have checked the following:Battery appears healthyBattery is correctly insertedTest leads are not brokenFuses are okayConnection from test leads to inside fuses is okay
