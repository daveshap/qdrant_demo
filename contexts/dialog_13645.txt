INDIANA: I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
CHATTAR LAL: A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
INDIANA: Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali.
CHATTAR LAL: Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
CAPT. BLUMBURTT: Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
