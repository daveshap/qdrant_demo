GORE: Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco. Just like you thought...Two murders in two days. Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
KILLAINE: A think wire---but very, very strong. Let's get out of here.
BRANDON: See anything?
BETTY: I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
BRANDON: There would be a moon tonight.
BRANDON: Cold?
BETTY: Frozen.
BRANDON: Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink. Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
