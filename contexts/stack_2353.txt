How can I record screen (gameplay) video capture alongside controller inputs in PS4? I would like to record some of my own gameplay for training purposes. This includes video capture of the screen as well as controller actions during the gameplay (what buttons are pressed and the directions of the thumb pads).Then I can replay what was recorded (gameplay alongside controller inputs).Can this be done, and how?(Pretty sure some professional gamers would do something like that as part of their training?)
