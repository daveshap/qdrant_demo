When anxiety makes you want to do things but depression makes you want to stay in bed
How do people cope?! My anxiety is like “YOU HAVE A DEADLINE” and my depression is like “it’d be really nice to just lay here all day”. It’s to the point where I’m submitting coursework an hour before it’s due because I have almost zero motivation but still get stressed because of the anxiety. I’ve been on propranolol and citalopram for about 11 weeks. The propranolol is great for the physical symptoms of anxiety but citalopram is doing nothing for my depression.
