Books/Resources on Student Affairs in Higher Education?
Hi there! 

I’m looking to switch careers and get my masters in higher ed/student affairs. I was very involved in residence life as an undergrad (RA, FM, mentor, etc.), so I have a good idea of what it’s like from a student perspective; however, before I completely switch gears I’d like to read about the field from an academic lens. Learn about the general field, the specialties, subsets, challenges, changes, etc.

Any book, article, journal, publication, blog, website recommendations? 

I won’t be applying till the fall for programs, so I have lots of time to research. I’ve reached out to mentors at my undergrad and they’re helpful, just figured I’d get a more general point of view. 

Thanks!
