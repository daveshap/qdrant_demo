HARDY: I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
HANA: He's sleeping.
HARDY: Only we have to go to work.
HANA: I'll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine?
HARDY: A bomb. At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
HANA: Does he have to go?
HARDY: Pardon me?
HANA: What if you couldn't find himâ€¦? Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
KIP: What's happening? Am I needed?
HARDY: I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent. Hana follows him.
HANA: Don't go. I'm frightened. I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
KIP: This is what I do. I do this every day.
