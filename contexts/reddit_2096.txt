I just had my Harvard Interview.
If you have any questions feel free to ask. My interviewer said the interview would be 30-45 minutes. It ended up being over an hour. I brought a resume and transcript with he took with him. I also brought certificates and awards and other things. I would get a leather portfolios if you could, however it is not required. I wore a plain sweater with slim fitting dress pants and ballet flats. Overall, it was a great experience. I was so nervous at first. I waited in my car for about 40 minutes before I went in. My interviewer was super straight faced at first, he seemed nervous at first as well. He was well put together as expected, and was very nice. He explained what he does as an interviewer and how the process worked. His opening question was why I applied. He also asked what book I have read recently or enjoyed. He also asked who I looked up to or thought was a hero. It went well.
