From £200 a month to feed a family of 4, to £400 a month.
So over the last couples of years my family and I have had £50 a week. To some that's an easily doable but my 2 kids go through food like it goes out of fashion. We've been creative over the years and stretched it pretty well but when you put everything else on the shop, toiletries cleaning products, it gets a bit harder. 
So over Christmas I got a promotion and had a pay increase of £100 extra a month. Through the help of sub reddits like this I've managed to lower my debts and expenses significantly and now I'm able to put £200 extra a month in the shop. Today is the first time the fridge has been truly filled in a long time. It's small victories like this that really make you see the significance of changes.
