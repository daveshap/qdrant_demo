LARCH: Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
ANGELA: Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
LARCH: You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
LARCH: Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
EDNA: He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
LARCH: I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
