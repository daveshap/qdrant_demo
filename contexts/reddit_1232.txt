I just want to say
Everyone here who has anxiety including me were are strong. We are fighting these anxiety and panics everyday and the people around you don't even know it. In public people always assume I am so calm but I am not lol I am fighting hard to not look crazy and let my anxiety take over. So to my fellow anxiety ridden redditors, keep fighting

Edit: I can't reply to everyone but your welcomeðŸ§¡
