Evaluation of this criticism of Sanders' tax plan
Just curious if anyone has come across this article: 


http://www.joshuakennon.com/thoughts-bernie-sanders-tax-economic-proposal/

From the perspective of someone without much formal background in tax or economics, it seems to bring up a lot of fair points: 

> "An estimated 45% of the tax revenue Sanders wants to raise comes from these offensive and onerous levies on working families, not the rich alone."

> "if you are self-employed, before we’ve even gotten to the other tax changes he wants to make, you are now looking at sending more than 1/5th of your income to the Federal government and you still wouldn’t have paid a penny of Federal, state, or local income taxes, sales taxes, or property taxes."
> 
> "By the time all is said and done, even accounting for the supposed free college and health care that Sanders is promising his voters, the discretionary purchasing power of nearly every family in this country, rich and poor alike, would be lowered, in some cases by double-digit percentages."


It's a bit of a long read (with a big "preamble"), and there are many more criticisms than what I quoted here. 

So my question - are these legitimate, well-founded criticisms or is there some bias, hyperbole or exaggeration in here?
