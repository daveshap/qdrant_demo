You're good enough
I just realised how silly I sounded the other day, I have started dating someone new and the other day I was thinking why wouldn't he just leave and find someone better and why does he think I'm good enough to date.

But we all have something to offer and things that make us unique and great as people. I have new hobbies which I'm interested in, I love my family and friends a lot, I have a good job which I like to work hard at and I'm passionate about certain projects that help people.

It was so stupid to think I might not be enough, how much more does someone have to be? We are all humans and make mistakes, but most of us do genuinely want to do the right thing and if you're not good enough for someone perhaps they're just trying to get the unattainable and it's not on you.

So unapologetically be yourself and someone will truly love you for it because what is love worth if they only love a persona or idea of you? What's the point in that?

UPDATE: This post is not at all to discourage self-improvement, if you are not happy where you are, then always keep improving and strive to be where you want to be. However just don't be so hard on yourself while dating and act like the other person is on a pedestal and you're not good enough, they're dating you for a reason and if it doesn't work out then your value as a person isn't lowered.
