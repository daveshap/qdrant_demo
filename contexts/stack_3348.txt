Which dimensions from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse exist in other works? Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse features versions of Spider-Man from various parallel dimensions. Are all of these \"new\" dimensions, or are they intended to be existing-dimensions within the Marvel multiverse of comics, films, etc.? In other words, are any of the Spider-People we see from established Marvel universes (e.g. Earth-616, Earth-1610, Earth-199999, Amazing Spider-Man universe, etc.), or does this movie exist outside the continuity of any other Marvel storyline?For example, is<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   The older, divorced, somewhat overweight thirtysomething Peter Parker</blockquote>supposed to represent a future Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel Cinematic Universe Spider-Man, or some other version of Spider-Man?To be clear, I'm not asking about what works inspired this movie, I'm asking to what extent it exists within the continuity of those previous works, as opposed to just being inspired by it.
