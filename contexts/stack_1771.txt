Need a solution: Why does the battery voltage drop for custom PCB? I have a custom PCB to control a solenoid or DC motor.Input voltage 6-7 volts with 4 batteries in series.I have a few questions:Why does the voltage drop by 1V to 1.5V when the switch is pressed to rotate solenoid or dc motor for 0.5 seconds?  Can anyone explain and provide a solution so that it doesn't drop?I tried some non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries. Almost all non-rechargeable batteries that I tried, the voltage drop was not fast or extreme, while every time I use a battery that can be recharged in one day the voltage drops so that the PC doesn't turn on. After I checked, out of 4 batteries, 2 voltages were in good condition, while 2 batteries dropped as they ran out of voltage. Could anyone explain and give the cause and what should I check?
