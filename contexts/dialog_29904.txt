LAURA: I'm nearly out.
BOBBY: It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight. This will tide you over.
LAURA: Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
BOBBY: Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
LAURA: Don't be late.
JAMES: I've got to see you.
LAURA: Not now.
JAMES: This afternoon?
LAURA: Okay. Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
JAMES: What about tonight?
LAURA: I can't tonight.
JAMES: What's going on?
LAURA: I just can't, James. I can't do it.
