Direct Farm Subsidies Ended in 2014, What Has Changed?
Three years ago, on Feb. 7th, 2014, the 2014 Farm Bill ([Agricultural Act of 2014, H.R. 2642] (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr2642enr/pdf/BILLS-113hr2642enr.pdf)) was signed into law.  

The week of its passing a thread was posted here on NP [discussing] (https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1xa3kg/farm_bill_changes_the_end_of_direct_subsidies/) the end of the direct payment subsidies.  Instead, crop insurance programs can be enhanced with a Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO) and this government assistance is triggered when area-wide yield or revenue losses are larger than [14%] (http://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/R43076.pdf) (pg.201).  

How has this change in government assistance affected [farm subsidies over time] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2006/07/02/GR2006070200024.html)?  Is the US government paying more or less now than it was using direct payment subsidies?  Should the US continue to subsidize farming this way?  Are there better solutions?
