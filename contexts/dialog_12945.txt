TALLEY: Now I understand. That helps. I can make them understand that.
DENNIS: Okay.
TALLEY: Let me come get him.
DENNIS: Fuck that! You bastards will jump me!
TALLEY: If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
DENNIS: You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
TALLEY: You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again. If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
