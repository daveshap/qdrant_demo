SEYMOUR: So is that your boyfriend?
ENID: Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
SEYMOUR: Well are --
ENID: Oh my god! We have to go in here!
SEYMOUR: Yeah, sure... very funny....
ENID: Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us... Please?
SEYMOUR: I - I'd really rather not...
ENID: We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
SEYMOUR: I don't think so...
ENID: PLEASE? We have to!
SEYMOUR: I really don't think it's a good idea.
ENID: Fine, I'll go by myself then...
ENID: Wow! Look at all these creeps!
SEYMOUR: Shh!
ENID: OH MY GOD!
