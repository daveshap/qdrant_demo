Job Search Expereince in COVID-19
Hey all,

 I just graduated with my M.Ed. in College Student Personnel Administration and have been job searching primarily in student success and academic advising. I know with the COVID-19, not as many jobs have shown up and have been pretty competitive. As such, I need to anticipate a long wait in this search process. I was wondering if there are folx that are willing to share their expereinces with the job search with me, and folx who are willing to share with me other areas of student affairs they went into, because I want to be prepared to go into other areas I may not be as interested in. Thanks!
