FLETCH: First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --
BOYD: Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
FLETCH: Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
BOYD: Unbelievable.
FLETCH: I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
BOYD: Utah? Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
FLETCH: God I admire you.
BOYD: By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
FLETCH: Comanche Indian.
FLETCH: Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?
MARGIE: Jim Swarthout?
FLETCH: Yeah.
MARGIE: And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
FLETCH: Frieda's boss.
MARGIE: Who's Frieda?
FLETCH: My secretary.
