HOLLY: I...have a request.
HANS: Oh? What idiot put you in charge?
HOLLY: You did. You murdered by Boss. Now... They're looking to me. Personally I'd pass on the jab. I don't enjoy being this close to you.
HANS: Go on.
HOLLY: We have a pregnant woman out there -- -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good. I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
HANS: No. But I'll have a sofa brought out to you. Good enough?
HOLLY: Good enough. And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
HANS: Yes, you're right. It will be done.
HANS: Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
HOLLY: Gennero. Miss Gennero.
