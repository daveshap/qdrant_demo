Me and my two year old baby boy have a warm place after months in a shelter..
Hello! I have been struggling for quite some time. Being a single mother is very challenging and also rewarding. 4 months ago I fell on hard times ended up in a shelter. I would like to say that today my credit has improved, I moved into my apartment yesterday, will start a better job come the New Year, son starts preschool, and things are looking up.
