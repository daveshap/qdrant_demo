Sample size calculation for elastic net regression I am using elastic net regression to investigate the effect of preditors on the response variable while accounting for multicollinearity among the predictors. But I wish to perform a sample size calculation in advance. I cannot find relevant materials on this issue. Is it fine to do sample size calculation based on multiple linear regression? Will elastic net regression require less or more samples compared with multiple linear regression given the same data? Anyway, I wish to know how to do sample size calculation for elastic net regression.
