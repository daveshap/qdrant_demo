The hardest part of being suicidal
The hardest part of being suicidal? At least for me (19 F), it's looking into the eyes of someone who loves you unconditionally and telling them that you're fine when you're having suicidal thoughts. 

My dad is everything to me. He is the most innocent and caring man I have ever encountered. He has tolerated all my rage attacks, crying episodes, tantrums, and has spoiled and loved me ever since the day I was born. I suffer from bipolar 2 and have been going through a severe depressive episode which usually happens around the same time every year. This year I know exactly what's happening and I want to try my best to get past these thoughts. If not for me, for my dad. I have not known real pain until I saw his eyes water today when he saw me crying. He knows me and what I go through. That hurts me the most.
