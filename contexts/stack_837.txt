Panel Transparency in KDE Plasma Okay, So using Kubuntu/KDE Plasma 5.13, I can obviously change colors, add panels and do a lot of personalization stuff that I really like. But what I am really interested in is changing the transparency/translucency of the panel. I can't do it via settings/(any other GUI stuff) obviously. Is there any kind of tweak (editing configuration files, etc.), coz I know it's possible as they create translucent/transparent themes. How is this done?
