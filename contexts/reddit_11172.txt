The CDC has known about this virus for more than two months. Where the fuck are the test kits?
Why the fuck do we have half the tests performed than South Korea? Why the hell are our elected officials not making this top priority? I am on my fourth day of chest pain and a cough, too minor to have any chance of getting tested according to the "you have to be THIS close to dead" guidelines. I just want to know as if I'm going to be immune as it means I can be on the front lines helping. And I want others to know so that we can actually contain it like South Korea and that town in Italy did.

We get no idea to a timeline to get this done at Trump's press conferences. We have no idea if we can ever roll them out. How is this acceptable? How can our leadership at the state and federal level not spend every ounce of energy ensuring that this happens? Call every testing expert in the country and get them to team up with any person who can replicate whatever the protocol is to create the test. We have universities, national labs, industry labs, all shut down that can certainly do such an assay. I've read paper after paper where people have established protocols to do the labwork [on one's phone](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/02/lab-chip-turns-smart-phones-mobile-disease-clinics) for disease identification; shouldn't that be a top priority for generating an efficient test for this virus? Shouldn't there be talks with hardware manufacturers to see this is done ASAP? Fucking hell. What the fuck are we doing?
