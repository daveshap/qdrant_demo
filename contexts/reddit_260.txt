How to not get your locker broken into
Yo bruh I’m somewhat of a pick pocket and I can’t even begin to tell you how many fucking people in my school have a 3 digit combination lock and the combination is 000.
I’ve opened so many fucking lockers this way,  
If you’re buying a 3 digit lock and you don’t change the code to something that isn’t 000 know that any guy with a little bit of knowledge of locks and a tiny bit of greed is gonna boost all of your shit and you’re basically asking him to do it.
