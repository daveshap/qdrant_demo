ELAINE: Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
STRIKER: That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
DR. RUMACK: Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
STRIKER: Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
