RATSO: The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
JOE: Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.

JOE: Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
RATSO: He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
