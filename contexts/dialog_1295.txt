STIFLER: Oh my fucking God. You're gay.
OZ: Come on, you know the words, sing along.
STIFLER: No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week. If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
OZ: Our last game is this Saturday.
STIFLER: No shit.
OZ: ...I've got this lacrosse game. It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
HEATHER: You can't sing at the competition.
OZ: I'm sorry, I totally spaced. I just...I didn't realize it...
HEATHER: ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
OZ: Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. So I guess...I'll see you later.
STIFLER: Kevin! You seen Shitbreak lately?
KEVIN: Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
STIFLER: Me? Nothing. I'm the one whose ass he kicked. I'll tell you one thing, though. I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
KEVIN: Finch! Get to the bathroom! Now!
FINCH: Easy, tiger. What's in there?
KEVIN: Just go!
FINCH: Why is this?
KEVIN: You're gonna shit your pants!
FINCH: Charming.
KEVIN: Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever. It's fast acting. I mean <u>really</u> fast.
FINCH: First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...Oohhhh!
