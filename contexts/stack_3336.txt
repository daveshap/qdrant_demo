Identify a short story where a paraplegic man travels back in time to save his wife but doesn't get the result he wants I would have most likely have read this in the '80s or early '90s in a magazine, almost certainly either Analog or Asimov's Science Fiction, two magazines I read regularly back then. The story opens with the male protagonist waking up in the morning and realizing that his body has changed - his upper body is significantly stronger and maybe his skin is tanned? In this story, time travel allows you to return physically to a previous time, but without any memory of what happens next, so the fact that he's changed triggers the realization that he's looped back. (This is either common to the world or common to people with his degree of wealth - I don't think he's the inventor of time travel.) So all he knows is that his future self bulked up for something, and his present-self job is to realize the moment. I think he also knows he has looped back before, because present-him remembers another change (or multiple changes) prior to this one.It turns out that the moment is the death of his wife, or what would be her death: they have a house that overlooks a valley or canyon or something, and she does something that causes her to fall over a railing or down an incline where she's holding on for her life. The protagonist realizes that past-him wasn't strong enough to save her and that future-him had spent all his remaining time bulking up to come back and do it. He is able to reach her (I don't think he simply wheels over to the edge, I think he has to leave his chair and drag himself to her, then pull her to safety) and she lives.The twist is that while she survives, their marriage doesn't - she ends up divorcing him.
