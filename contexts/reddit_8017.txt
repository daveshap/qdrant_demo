Grad Student Stipend Spreadsheet?
Hello, I remember seeing a google spreadsheet on here comparing the graduate student stipends across the US, and also listing the fees, health insurance costs, etc., but for the life of me I cannot find it again. 

Maybe this isn't the right place to ask, but does anyone know where I can find that spreadsheet? Thanks!
