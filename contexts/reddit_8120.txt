Jerry Brown & California Threatening to withhold federal tax transfers to Washington: what would have to happen for this to become a reality?
According to CBS San Francisco: 

>"The state of California is studying ways to suspend financial transfers to Washington after the Trump administration threatened to withhold federal money from sanctuary cities" 


The notion is novel and fascinating. So what exactly would be legally required to make this happen? Does this violate any laws or constitutional amendments? What stands in the way? What are the ramifications. How much could California actually withhold? Has anything like this ever been done before?


Very interested in hearing a neutral perspective on what this all means.
