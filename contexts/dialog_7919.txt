ED: Hello.
KATHY: Hello. You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
ED: I got married last night.
KATHY: Oh. Congratulations.
ED: The marriage already ended.
KATHY: Oh. My condolences.
ED: What are you making?
KATHY: Booties for my father. He gets cold in this hospital.
ED: How long's he been here?
KATHY: This is my thirteenth pair.
ED: Excuse me. Doctor? I'm with Mr. Lugosi. How is he?
DOCTOR: Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
ED: Will he be okay?
DOCTOR: We'll do our best.
