MAJOR FIDON: Good day, monsieur. Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN: My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
MAJOR FIDON: Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN: No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
MAJOR FIDON: May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN: Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
MAJOR FIDON: If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
RUSSIAN GENTLEMAN: If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
