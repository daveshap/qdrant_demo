LAWRENCE: He's in the fluoroscope now. Listen to his heart. Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore. It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
JOHANA: How long can he stay down? Without breathing?
LAWRENCE: It depends. He should come up soon. Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
JOHANA: Why is he doing this?
LAWRENCE: For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
JOHANA: Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
LAWRENCE: Coffee might be nice.
JOHANA: Will he understand Spanish?
LAWRENCE: His mother's an American. He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
JACQUES: I recognize you.
JOHANA: We saw each other a little while ago.
JACQUES: In the lake?
JOHANA: No... in the hut.
