Remove (or throttle) fan on eMac I'm replacing the HDD  with a SSD on an eMac (1 GHz). I get a headache from the  loud fan noise. A friend who does hardware repairs said the fan is there mainly because of the HDD, so I should then be able to disconnect the fan. Can someone with knowledge and experience with this confirm?If the machine will fail without the fan, we plan to throttle the fan, ie. adjust its supplied power based on the measured temperature in the cabinet. Please share any knowledge/experience with this.
