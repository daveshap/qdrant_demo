SETH: Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
RICHARD: There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
SETH: No. That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
RICHARD: Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
SETH: Is it me? Is it my fault?
RICHARD: It's not your fault, it's her fault!
SETH: Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
RICHARD: What?
SETH: This is not me! I am a professional fucking thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don't kill people I don't have to, and I don't rape women. What you doin' ain't how it's done. Do you understand?
RICHARD: Seth, if you were me --
SETH: Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
RICHARD: Yes.
SETH: Yes, Seth, I understand.
RICHARD: Yes, Seth, I understand.
