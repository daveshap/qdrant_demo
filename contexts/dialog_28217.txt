JEAN LE MAISTRE: Who told you to wear men's clothes?
JEANNE: The clothes are not important...
JEAN LE MAISTRE: You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man! It proves your desire to deceive...
JEANNE: It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
JEAN LE MAISTRE: So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
JEANNE: I... submit to Our Lord.
JEAN LE MAISTRE: But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
JEANNE: It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same. Why must you complicate what is so simple?
CAUCHON: Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne. On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved. And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians. Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error. That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
JEANNE: So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
CAUCHON: It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
JEANNE: I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
MAITRE MAURICE: When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
JEANNE: Yes... a half-steed... white.
MAITRE MAURICE: Who gave you that horse?
JEANNE: My king.
MAITRE MAURICE: How many did he give you?
JEANNE: Five steeds and a few hackneys...
MAITRE MAURICE: As much as for a Lord? What an honor! Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
JEANNE: No.
MAITRE MAURICE: What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
JEANNE: Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
MAITRE MAURICE: Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
JEANNE: And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
BEAUPERE: Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
JEANNE: I tried to.
BEAUPERE: It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
JEANNE: I don't remember. Maybe.
BEAUPERE: Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
JEANNE: I don't know...
BEAUPERE: And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
JEANNE: No... I said Surrender in the name of the King of France"..."
BEAUPERE: That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
JEANNE: I can't read.
BEAUPERE: Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission! Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
JEANNE: I leave the answer to God.
JEAN MIDI: Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
JEANNE: I had been sold to the English. I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
JEAN MIDI: Did your voice tell you to jump?
JEANNE: No...
JEAN MIDI: So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
JEANNE: No...!
JEAN MIDI: How can you deny it when you just said I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?"
JEANNE: That's now what I meant...
JEAN MIDI: Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin? No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
JEANNE: I know, but that's not the way things happened...
JEAN MIDI: You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
JEANNE: Yes, but...
JEAN MIDI: And you didn't jump of your free will?
JEANNE: No!
JEAN MIDI: Oh? Perhaps someone pushed you then?
BEAUPERE: Do you have a sword?
JEANNE: Quite a few.
BEAUPERE: Didn't you also carry a banner?
JEANNE: Yes...
BEAUPERE: Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
JEANNE: I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
BEAUPERE: And why was that? Did it have some particular value or power?
JEANNE: No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
BEAUPERE: And?
JEANNE: And so I... I prefer my banner.
BEAUPERE: Why?
JEANNE: To avoid killing anyone.
BEAUPERE: Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
JEANNE: No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
BEAUPERE: Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
JEANNE: No! I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
BEAUPERE: We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
JEANNE: Yes, probably... maybe...
BEAUPERE: So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
JEANNE: Yes, but...
BEAUPERE: Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
JEANNE: No, I... I held it up to...
BEAUPERE: You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
JEANNE: Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
BEAUPERE: ... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
JEANNE: No, I... I never killed anyone!
