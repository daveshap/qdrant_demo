DODGE: Then what the hell happened to him?
MURPHY: Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
EPPS: Greer?
MURPHY: I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
MURPHY: It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know, it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
DODGE: Not me.
EPPS: He needs a doctor.
MURPHY: I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up. Keep an eye on him.
