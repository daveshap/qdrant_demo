Don’t you just love college professors?
I spend a whole ass hour the other day crafting an e-mail to a professor. I literally quibbled over every stinking word, comma, and period.

Today, I got a response.

1. The professor spelled “maybe“ as ”mebbe” not once, but twice
2. In two places, he used an “;” instead of a “ ‘ “
3. Jesus Christ this guy loves run-on sentences
4. No. Capitals. On. Anything. Not. Even. His. Or. My. Name.
5. He referred to himself as “profession paul“

This dude went to YALE AND HARVARD.

Conclusion: college is going to be a blast 🎉 🤘
