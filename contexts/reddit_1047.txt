I slept with the lights off for the first time in 15+ years
I’ve had crippling nighttime anxiety around someone hiding in my apartment and watching me. It has severely impacted my sleep and I’ve had to sleep with all the lights on, locks on all of my doors, just every coping mechanism possible since I was 8 or 9. For the past 2 years I’ve been in therapy and doing small exposures to disprove this belief that I have. 

Last night was the first time I could turn off all the lights in my bedroom and sleep in the dark. 

Seems small but I’m proud
