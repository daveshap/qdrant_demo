I don’t want to be alive anymore
I would turn to someone else, if everyone I knew didn’t absolutely hate me.
I tried therapy. I’m bad at talking to people. I get scared by talking to adults, despite nearly being one myself. 
I tried being honest with the people I love, but they all say that they’ve had it worse. 
I’m not exactly someone that’s easy to get along with, either. I’m loud, obnoxious, and god, am I stupid. So, that means that I don’t really have anyone else around to help me, because my god-awful personality drives everyone away.
I tried. I really tried. 
But, trying wasn’t worth it. 
I’m just so tired. And every day leaves me more exhausted. I just don’t want to feel like this anymore. 
I’m trying one more time, to reach out for support, I mean. I really could use some support, maybe someone to listen, and not make fun of me for everything going on.
Just someone to be there for me would be nice. 
I’m sorry, I’m really dumb.
