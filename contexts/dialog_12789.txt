EGELHOFFER: Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
EGELHOFFER: Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
WILLIAMS: Yes, sir.
EGELHOFFER: So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
WILLIAMS: Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
EGELHOFFER: Point the gun at me!
