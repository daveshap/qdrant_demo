Cap maximum wall outlet voltage I live in a rural area.A problem occured when my UPS could not run my computer simply because of voltage fluctuations. I have tried many stabilizers but its too rapid that it would make a tick and the UPS would switch to battery then on line after some time it would run out of juice and just decide to shut off.I now have many stabilizers but none worked. the last fix I can think of is the cap/ throttle the outlet voltage to 100-110 depending the minimum its fluctuating from so the stabilizer won't tick and the UPS neither hence running all day long.TL;DR: How to Cap / throttle the output voltage a wall outlet to stop stablizer from making a tick, hence running the UPS on line. ANY way even bringing an electrician and do what's described in the answer.
