I have the desire to be around people but absolutely zero motivation to attempt it and I feel like it makes me look desperate and awkward
interacting with people or even going out of my way to talk to them just feels completely forced, I'm totally fine with being alone when I am alone (in fact, I generally prefer it that way) but when I'm around people I feel like I have to make some effort to socialize but it feels like a total chore to do it and I always feel like I'm trying too hard, I don't hate people, I enjoy making friends and getting to know them, I just don't know how to interact with them and prefer being alone to feeling like I'm getting in people's way
