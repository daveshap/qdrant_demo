FREYA: Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
ERIK: The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
FREYA: But have you ever seen it? Think back...
ERIK: Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
FREYA: The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
