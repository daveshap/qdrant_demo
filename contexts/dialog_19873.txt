WILLIAM: Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
ANNA: No thanks.
WILLIAM: Coffee?
ANNA: No.
WILLIAM: Orange juice -- probably not.
WILLIAM: Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
ANNA: Really, no.
WILLIAM: Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
ANNA: No.
WILLIAM: Do you always say 'no' to everything?
ANNA: No. I better be going. Thanks for your help.
WILLIAM: You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
