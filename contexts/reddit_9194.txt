I just sold my truck that was crippling me financially and it feels really good.
I was really sad to see it go and I'll lose a bit of freedom in the short term but I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I'm already feeling a lot better about the next 12 months.

It was the last thing on my debt snowball list (credit card still on there at present) and I didn't realise how much it was affecting me until I sold it. 

I'm really grateful I've got a supportive partner who will share her car with me over the next 6ish months whilst I finish uni as a mature age student. I couldn't do it without her.

EDIT: Thanks for all the supportive words and sharing of similar stories! Also thank you for downvoting to hell those that decided to comment on my relationship with my partner with zero insight into our situation.

It's good to see reddit hasn't quite gone full facebook just yet.
