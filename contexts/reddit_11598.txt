All I can Ever Think About Is Girls
It's the most annoying thing in the world. I don't know why but they are all I can think about. All I ever want to do is hang out with any girl I am attracted to. I recognize it as neediness.

It's so damn frustrating because I know I can have fun without girls and I know I should be focusing on my studies or whatever else...but I obsess and obsess over them. 

I am sure someone else has dealt with this. How'd you get over...overthinking of girls?
