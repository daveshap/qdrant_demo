SHELDRAKE: That's impossible. You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
BUD: Yes, sir -- I understand. She left a note -- you want me to open it and read it to you? Well, it was just a suggestion -- no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise --
