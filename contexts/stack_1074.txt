Does anyone know of a substitute, or native application, for notes and notebooks in Ubuntu? I've been testing Evernote for a month.I believe that it has a perfect design, adequate functionalities that adapt well to my workflow.Mainly the notes are academic notes, drafts of documents and personal and family annotations.What I'm looking for basically is:Cloud-basedSynchronization with mobilesNotes with styles and organization in folders or notebooks
