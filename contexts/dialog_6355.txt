JERRY: The sound of love.
CYNIC: Excuse me?
JERRY: That's love.
CYNIC: Love? Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'. Love is bullshit.
JERRY: I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar. I saw you kiss. Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
JERRY: Love gives you wings. It makes you fly. I don't even call it love. I call it Geronimo.
CYNIC: Geronimo?
JERRY: Geronimo. When you're really in love, you'll jump. Off the top of the Empire State. Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
CYNIC: But you'll die. You'll squash yourself. What's the point?
JERRY: Aren't you listening, man? Love gives you wings.
CYNIC: She must be some girl.
JERRY: I love her so bad. She just... wrecks me. I would die for her.
