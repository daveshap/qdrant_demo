Using groundwater data in ArcMap? I have raw data in the form of groundwater levels collected regularly over a couple of years. The values are collected in an excel file together with xy coordinates for the water wells (of which there are between 10 and 20) as well as z ground level values.My goal is to present the water levels (the important data) in a way that is easy to understand and maybe a bit more interesting than simply showing the position of the wells and keep the values in the attribute table. I want the viewer to understand how the water levels vary within in the area.But since I'm kind of new to GIS and ArcMap I'm not sure what's a good way to do this. Do you have any suggestions?What I have done so far is turn the wells into vector points based on the xy values in the excel file. The rest of the values can be viewed in the attribute table.Since the water wells are located at different heights I guess it's pointless to do an interpolation of the water levels.
