Advertising major looking to get into student advising
I’m a recent college graduate who majored in Advertising. I’ve been in my field for a bit now, but the more that I learn about it the more I’m unsure if it’s what I want to do. I’ve thought about student advising before but never looked into it much until recently. I was curious if anyone had any advice on if I do pursue this. Do I go to grad school for student affairs? Could I get a job at a university with only my Advertising degree? Any suggestions or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
