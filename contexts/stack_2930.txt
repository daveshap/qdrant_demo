Why is the centre of mass displaced even when external force is 0? <blockquote>  A pulley fixed to a rigid support carries a rope whose one end is tied to a ladder and a man and the other end to the counterweight of mass $M$. The man of mass $m$ climbs up a distance of $h$ with respect to the ladder and then stops. If the mass of the rope and the friction in the pulley axle are negligible find the displacement of the center of mass of the system.</blockquote>My question is that the net external force on the system is 0 then why is there any displacement of centre of mass?
