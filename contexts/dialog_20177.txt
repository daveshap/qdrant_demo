ROSE: Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
TURKLE: Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
ROSE: Who is he?
MCMURPHY: He's in charge.
ROSE: Are you a doctor?
TURKLE: Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.
ROSE: Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck. Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
MCMURPHY: Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
ROSE: Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb. Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
TURKLE: Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
ROSE: I thought so.
TURKLE: Is he in an asylum?
ROSE: He's dead.
TURKLE: Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
ROSE: That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
TURKLE: I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
ROSE: You ol' fucker!
TURKLE: Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
MCMURPHY: Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
ROSE: What?
TURKLE: I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
MCMURPHY: Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
ROSE: Wait a minute...
CANDY: It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
ROSE: Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
CANDY: Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
ROSE: Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
TURKLE: Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
ROSE: Oh, yeah...
TURKLE: You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
ROSE: Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
TURKLE: Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall.
CANDY: Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
ROSE: Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
