Internships Abroad/Advice
Hi all,

I'm looking into internships abroad for this next summer and am looking for more options (specifically, I've only found America University of Kuwait and ACUHO-I options thus far). Any advice on where to look/apply?

Also, does anyone have a sample candidate statement for ACUHO-I's system?

Thanks in advance!
