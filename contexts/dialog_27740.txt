MACFARLANE: Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
FETTES: No.
MACFARLANE: What do you mean, Fettes?
FETTES: I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
MACFARLANE: Don't be a fool. One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray.
MEG: You're not going to Gray.
MACFARLANE: He must leave me alone.
