CHRIS: Derek... stop.
DEREK: Why?
CHRIS: You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
DEREK: I'm sorry. I just wanted to surprise you. What can I say?
CHRIS: You can say... Hello
DEREK: Hello. How are you?
CHRIS: You haven't changed a bit. Always so sure of yourself. Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
DEREK: Is that so bad?
CHRIS: I don't know.
DEREK: You're irresistible. I lose control.
CHRIS: Just slow down. Let me get to know you again. Let me get to know this place again.
DEREK: Okay. There's a whole weekend ahead of us. There's time.
