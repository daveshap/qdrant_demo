DAVID LEE: Did you see Daddy?
REBECCA: No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
DAVID LEE: Can I go when the holiday comes?
REBECCA: You sure can, son...
REBECCA: Any sign of Sounder?
DAVID LEE: No mam -- I looked all over.
REBECCA: I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
