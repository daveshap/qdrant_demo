Is it worth it to apply to job postings that has been up for 1+ months?
Especially if I meet 70%+ of the qualifications they mention?
What does it mean if employers keep their postings up for more than a month? They couldn't find the right candidate or they are not hiring and just vacuuming talent pool?

Thanks.
