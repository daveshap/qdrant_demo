Juniors- when making your college list, PLEASE spend more time researching your safeties and matches instead of putting all your time into reaches
I think most people here are smart enough to know the golden rule to have a safety in case your favorite schools don’t accept you.  However, so often I see people who

1. know literally nothing about their safety/matches

2. apply to safeties that they DON’T LIKE just to say that they have a safety

Please, instead of taking 30 hours to gawk over some t20s program for your major, put ACTUAL research into forming your list of safeties and matches.  I’ve talked to multiple people online who applied to Northeastern as a match and have no idea what the co-op program when its literally the main reason to apply there.  I also see lots of people who apply to a safety school that they hate just to say they have one, then end up miserable at the end of the process.

Please, FIND SAFETIES AND MATCHES YOU LOVE.  I understand that all the hype and anxiety is over t20s and ivy’s, but there are amazing safety schools that will give you amazing opportunities if things don’t go as planned. If your worst case scenario is something you love, this entire process will be alot less scary.  I’ll give a personal shoutout to Drexel as an amazing safety for t50 applicants, but there are more schools that I can count that have high acceptance rates, give good merit aid, and will give you an amazing education despite not being prestigious.  Shoot your shot at t20s, but as I said before, if your worst case scenario is a happy ending, you can’t come out of this process with a bad result.
