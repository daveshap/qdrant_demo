MCKINNEY: You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
DENBY: Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
ANYA: Feeling a little better, I see.
BRETT: Yes, yes--the air-- --I'm getting plenty of air. Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
SALLY: How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache. --and it's so noisy up here.
ANYA: Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise. Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
BRETT: Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
ANYA: Sooner--if you like. See you again, I hope.
BRETT: Isn't she attractive?
SALLY: Very--your mother?
BRETT: Don't be a c-a-t.
SALLY: You asked me to dine with you tonight.
BRETT: Yes?
SALLY: Well, I can't.
BRETT: Don't rub it in.
SALLY: But I'll have cocktails with you.
BRETT: When?
SALLY: At seven-thirty?
BRETT: Sooner it you like.
SALLY: Okay.
BRETT: Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
SALLY: Wrong again-- But I dislike possessive women.
