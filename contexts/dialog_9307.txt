ARNOLD: Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
BRAD: Arnold. What's happening?
ARNOLD: Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
BRAD: You want to work at Carl's?
ARNOLD: Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
BRAD: I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
ARNOLD: All right!!
STACY: Hi, Brad.
BRAD: Sis.
