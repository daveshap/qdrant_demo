Already getting hours slashed and threatened to be fired after less than a month, first job
So I just recently got a new job at a restaurant, between 2 and 3 weeks ago, I'm currently still in high school and this is my first ever job, my boss knows all this, yet before even 2 weeks he was already cutting my hours real short and sending me home early, and telling me it's because I'm doing everything too slow.

Now I do acknowledge that I'm obviously not the most efficient person there, but is that expected after less than 2 weeks at my first job? He said I had this week to prove myself to not get fired, and I got the schedule for next week and I only have one shift, and now I'm afraid he's gonna have me work that last shift before dropping me, honestly idk what kind of answers I'm looking for, perhaps I'm just looking for answers from others if you guys think this is justified. Maybe at this point I should be much better? I'm a lot better than my first day that's for sure, but another kicker, we got 2 new guys, hired around the same time, one of them has quite a bit of work experience and picked it up real fast, so kudos to him, but this other new guy, he's way slower than me!!! Last shift I had with him, he did everything at what seemed like half my speed, yet he's getting way more hours.

Now one thing to mention, if this might have an effect, I'm the only minor there, everyone else is graduated, going to college, or trying to develop some other career, and most people they have working 6-8 hour shifts, maybe I just don't fit in well with his wanted schedule

Again, I don't know what I'm expecting to get out of this post, but if anyone has any questions to further diagnose the problem, or any suggestions, I just feel lost and I don't know who to talk to about it
