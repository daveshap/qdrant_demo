JULIE: What?
PHIL: Did you hear what he said?
JULIE: What?
PHIL: He made, you know, a remark.
JULIE: Honey, are you okay?
PHIL: -- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is? Some nice neighborhood.
JULIE: Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine. Don't get in an uproar.
PHIL: I know. It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
JULIE: It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
