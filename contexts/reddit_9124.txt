I work at a bank part time...
and I want to remind you that you're not alone. I'm broke as hell too. And so are so many of our customers. I see people with 2 kids in the back and $40 in their account depositing their paycheck to eat that week. I see the single woman living in her overdraft, getting charged $29 for each overdraw because she had a medical bill and now cant get her account positive. I see the elderly folks living Social Security check to Social Security check, barely keeping their heads above water. I see the rural farmer hoping the money from selling a calf will get him through the winter months. I see myself, the one put on part time, slowly draining my savings to be able to pay rent. 

And of course I see the wealthy people. But let me tell you, before working at a bank, I thought a lot of people were more well off than they are. We're all out here struggling through this capitalist shitshow of a world. 

I believe in you.

Edit: quick note, the bank I work at services areas in Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas, and my job involves video chatting and doing transactions for people in all of those places. I've been here since January
