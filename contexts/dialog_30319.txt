SCOTTIE: Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
MADELEINE: What?
SCOTTIE: ...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
MADELEINE: No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
SCOTTIE: No... this is the first time for me, too.
