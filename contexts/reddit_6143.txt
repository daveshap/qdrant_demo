PLEASE HELP, I hate my job more then I've hated anything ever before
so I need to finish college, and don't wanna go into debt. so I picked up a second job which within 6 pay periods has accumulated enough money for me to pay for the remainder of my undergrad. 

my Major is Cyber Security and Data Assurance. 

Currently I have a job as a threat analyst this job pays for my monthly expenses though so there is little I can save, meaning in order to be able to afford college will take ages.

I have no family which can help. I picked up a early day shift for doTERRA which is by far a terrible company, I'm honestly having a moral dilemma working for them. I'm only Customer Service for Northern Europe because I speak the Languages that they require.

So what do I do, should I just suck it up? or what kind of jobs should I look for I need them to pay a minimum of 18/hr preferably early in the morning.
