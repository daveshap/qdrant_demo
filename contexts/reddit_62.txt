I need a solution
Hi so I have a question and I really hope someone can help. So I am usually a really nervous and anxious person. I would always but my nails, scratch myself and pick on my cuticles stuff like that. Just last year I had started self harming to cope with my stress at school. I recently stopped biting my nails and harming it was hard but I manage. I have found a way to cope with myself when I’m anxious. I’ve started pulling out my hair. I pulled out my hair on the middle of my head. And now I have a baled spot. I’m really embarrassed of it and don’t know what to do. I sound stupid. But for now I have to take my hair up which I also hate doing bc I’m insecure. Can anyone tell me how to grow hair back into the bald spot? Or even how long it will take? I will really appreciate it. 
Hiii it’s been more than a month since I made this post and I have been wearing the same hairstyle so no one can notice. I’m rlly getting desperate and jus want to wear my hair down does anyone have any methods so I can grow back the hair. Also thanks for all the support!
