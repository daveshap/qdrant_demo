PLATO: What's your name!
JIM: Jim. What's yours?
PLATO: Plato. It's a nickname.
PLATO: Listen, I told you not to fool with them. Now they're waiting for you.
JIM: I know. That's why I came back.
PLATO: You scared?
JIM: I just don't want trouble.
PLATO: He has a knife.
JIM: I saw it. Gee, look at that thing swing, will you? Do you think it never stops?
PLATO: No. It's perpetual motion.
JIM: Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it. Go- go-go!
