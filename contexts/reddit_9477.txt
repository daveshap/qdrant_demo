I’m making changes in 2019
I’m so sick of scraping by. I have debt I’ll never pay off at this rate and I’m constantly stressed over money. 

So, I’ve started making changes. I’ve just applied for a second job as my current job has been losing hours like crazy. 

I also plan to head to my credit union to see if I can get a personal loan at a lower interest rate consolidate my credit card debt. 

I’ve been on this subreddit since day one. I know I’m not great with money. I have a very poor relationship with money. Through reading this subreddit, I know I can change that!

Hopefully by the end of 2019 I’ll have some money saved up thanks to this subreddit! You all are awesome.
