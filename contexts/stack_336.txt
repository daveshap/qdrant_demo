How to remove a large number of unused keywords from Apple Photos app? My Photo library has evolved over many years, starting out as an iPhoto library, then being merged with an Aperture library, then becoming a Photos library.  Over the course of the last 20 or so years I've accumulated thousands of keywords that have zero photos associated with them.The Photos app itself does not support a 'Delete unused keywords' feature, and I have looked at using AppleScript to do this, but, despite being quite an experienced programmer, I could not work out how to do this (AppleScript drives me nuts quite honestly).I'm hoping someone has already written such a script, or if not a script then some other utility that will do this for me.
