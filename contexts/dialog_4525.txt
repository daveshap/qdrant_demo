MR. HENRY: Congratulations. You passed the test.
ANTHONY: What do you mean?
MR. HENRY: The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
ANTHONY: That was a test?
MR. HENRY: Take a deep breath.
MR. HENRY: How does that feel?
ANTHONY: It feels good.
ANTHONY: Did Dignan take the test?
MR. HENRY: Yes, he did.
ANTHONY: How'd he do?
MR. HENRY: Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
ANTHONY: That sounds like Dignan.
