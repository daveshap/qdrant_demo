$2.40 a day for the next 10 days
I have $24 for the next 10 days. I‚Äôm EXTREMELY stressed and disappointed in myself , as I said I wouldn‚Äôt be back here again. I‚Äôve already sold some clothing to make the aforementioned $24 (thanks buffalo exchange) and have taken more hours at work to help me out next paycheck. 

Instead of beating myself up about being in CC debt and living paycheck to paycheck, I‚Äôve decided to highlight things I should be PROUD of here - 

‚Ä¢ no student loans 
‚Ä¢ rent paid 
‚Ä¢ gas/electrity paid 
‚Ä¢ phone paid 
‚Ä¢ live close enough to work to walk / can work from home to save on transit fare 
‚Ä¢ made minimum payment on CC to avoid late fees. 
‚Ä¢ Empty fridge, but I can live on pasta and sauce for a week or so. (I‚Äôm not sure my partner can, but if he wants a meal, he can pay for groceries or buy us dinner ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) 


Having a roof over my head, heat in the cold months, and a phone is a blessing and I won‚Äôt let myself lose sight of the positives. 

If you‚Äôre having a tough time, you‚Äôre not alone. There‚Äôs literally 165k subscribed to the sub for a reason. Just count the blessings you have to keep the faith. 

EDIT : hello I posted that on my lunch break and just got off work to a BUNCH of helpful and thoughtful replies. Thank you everyone for your time and suggestions ! 

I quickly googled food pantries near me and there are a few not too far away ! I will be taking full advantage of the blessings and resources within my reach and continue to stay positive. 

Edit #2: AND THANK YOU FOR MY FIRST GOLD !
