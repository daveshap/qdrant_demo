HAROLD: What's the matter?
PENELOPE: Give us time.
HAROLD: Like hugging a lamp post.
PENELOPE: Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
HAROLD: You were well adjusted to my being dead?
PENELOPE: We adjust to what there is to adjust to. Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately. I hope he can. I will take a little longer. I'll be as quick as I can.
HAROLD: What sort of time period do you have in mind? Half an hour? An hour?
PENELOPE: I don't know. This is a new disease to me.
HAROLD: Disease?
PENELOPE: Situation.
HAROLD: This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
PENELOPE: A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
HAROLD: Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
PENELOPE: Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
HAROLD: You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
PENELOPE: Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
