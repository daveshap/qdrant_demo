regression on 2d vector in r Trying to do a simple regression on a 2d vectors. I don't think this is the right way. vec1x=  c(0.4191, -0.0064, -0.1071,  0.0605, -0.0290)vec1y=  c(8.0054,  5.7876,  6.9907,  7.9606,  8.8073)vec2x=  c(2.5424,  5.1469,  4.7073,  4.3420,  6.7717)vec2y=  c(1.1129,  2.6307,  1.7691,  0.3857, -1.6576)vec3x=  c(1.8899,  3.7936,  4.3746,  2.7874,  1.3930)vec3y=  c(9.6567,  7.4949,  6.7109,  6.9061,  8.7460)REG=glm(c(vec3x,vec3y) ~  c(vec1x,vec1y)+ c(vec2x,vec2y))but when I run the X  and Y separately I get different beta (I should?).Is there another type of regression I can use that can take care of this 2d?Im new to this stuff.
