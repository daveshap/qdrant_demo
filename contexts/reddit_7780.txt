How much are PIs supposed to help?
I got into a PhD program two months ago. Since then I've been talking to my PI since I was in the lab as an undergrad a while ago. She thought it might be a good idea to join in on their weekly meetings to get a sense of what they're doing right now and be involved. I joined in last week and I'm so lost. I know it's just for me to see how they operate but even seeing the undergrads do more than me and be more involved scared me. Will things get better once the fall term and my program as a PhD student officially starts? Will my PI then start helping me out more and directly involving me in the projects? For now I'm really discouraged and I have a major feeling of imposter syndrome being so lost in the lab. I'm doing the readings my PI is talking about and trying my best to understand what they're doing right now but obviously I don't know the details of their proposed study so I can't do much. Also the fact that everything is online right now is not helping.

So I wanted to ask, how much is a PI supposed to help you? Is mine not that involved with me right now because it's the summer and my program hasn't officially started yet?
