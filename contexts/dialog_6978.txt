JENNIFER: I think he called you beautiful.
FRIDA: Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said Hey there beautiful.""
CARLTON: Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
FRIDA: Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
CARLTON: Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
