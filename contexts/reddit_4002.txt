I genuinely don’t understand what I’m missing with online dating, I’m completely inept
I’ve been on Reddit for a minute, I know *all* the classic responses to people saying they need help on their tinder/bumble profiles. I have a variety of photos that at least I think look good and show off my personality. I used to have a good bio that showed off what my interests are and gave a lot of points for someone to start a conversation with. Then I had people tell me I put too much in my bio and it should be short and succinct - fine, I’ve done that. I try to show genuine interest when I get a match, because I hate it when I talk to someone with the personality of a plank. I try to move things along to a physical date as soon as possible but then things fizzle out. I used to live in a really small town so I’ve moved to Chicago since then, partially for a larger dating pool but mostly to advance my own interests. 

I thought things would be better since I moved, considering it has like 200x the population density. But I hardly get any matches, maybe one a week, and on bumble only one person of 5 has actually sent a message so I couldn’t even talk to 4 of them. And when I do get a match most of the time they seem so bored and disinterested.

I want to date people I meet in real life but I do *not* want to be seen as a creep. All I ever hear are women saying they get approached too often. I don’t want to disturb anyone at a cafe or something, especially if they have headphones in. At bars, nearly all women are with friends and I tend to go alone, and so that’s a no-go. 

I’m starting improv classes soon so I’m hoping that will help, but still I feel like I’m missing out on a lot in life, and I get so frustrated when people talk about how easy it was for them to find a SO or how many dates they go on. Like, how?!

Sorry, that was a lot of word salad but I had to get that off my chest
