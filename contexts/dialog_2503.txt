JENNIFER: Brian. What's wrong?
BRIAN: You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
JENNIFER: I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
BRIAN: -- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
JENNIFER: Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
BRIAN: -- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
JENNIFER: I was doing my job.
BRIAN: Yeah? And just how much of all this has been doing your job"?"
JENNIFER: Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
BRIAN: Leave Stephen out of this --
JENNIFER: Oh yeah, he's the real fireman. Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
BRIAN: -- I work for the city.
JENNIFER: You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
SWAYZAK: Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
BRIAN: Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
