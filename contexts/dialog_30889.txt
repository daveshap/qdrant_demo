STECKLER: No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
CARTER: STEPHANIE?
STECKLER: My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
CARTER: Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
STECKLER: STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
CARTER: What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
STECKLER: It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
STECKLER: I want it to stop - it all to stop...
CARTER: Then make it stop...
