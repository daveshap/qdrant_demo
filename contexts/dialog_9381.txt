DUKE: You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
GONZO: Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
DUKE: What tape?
GONZO: Jefferson Airplane. White Rabbit." I want a rising sound."
DUKE: You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
GONZO: I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
DUKE: OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.
GONZO: Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
DUKE: How about a check?
GONZO: Whatever's right.
