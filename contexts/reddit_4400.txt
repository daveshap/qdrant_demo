Tips to Cope with Depression: A Novice's Guide to Self Help
For context I'm a 25F in a highly developed city on the west coast. I'm currently in a serious relationship but been single for long periods of time and dealt with failed relationships after years of commitment. I grew up in a conservative religious home with neither parents active in the household since the age of 8. I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 10-15 years give or take. Here is just a short list of tips and tricks that help me claw myself out of an unannounced spiraling depression episode. Obviously everyone is different but I hope this can help at least one person not sink further into the depression pit. It has taken me years of introspective thought and practicing different behaviors to the point where I think I recognize my triggers and I feel I have some sort of handle on it now to where I can cope. I hope everyone on here gets the help they need and realize that there is hope if you're willing to fight for yourself. I know this post is going to be unbearably long at some parts but I think it's important for me to explain what I do and why I do it so you can hopefully apply it to your lives.

1. **Keep a journal:** As trivial and silly as it sounds, keeping a journal to unleash all my uninhibited thoughts and feelings helped me immensely throughout my adolescence and adulthood. I had always been the person hesitant to confide in a non-professional (family, friend, coworker etc) to avoid judgement, unsolicited advice, fake sympathy and I feel a lot of people feel the same way. The first big step I took for my depression is writing down a 7 page account of events that I believe lead to a perpetual state of depression. Getting all that information out of my head gave me a huge sense of relief. I never knew I was holding onto so much weight and animosity toward a situation or a specific person until it fell out of me like an emotional waterfall.
2. **Cut out toxic relationships/friendships:** This was probably one of the hardest steps in my journey and one I heard on a constant basis from countless articles. It's a lot easier said than done but I can wholeheartedly say cutting out specific people in my life that brought nothing but a dissatisfaction has drastically improved my state of being. Sometimes it's hard to tell when someone needs to be cut out but I had to ask myself if I'm spending time with this person because I was lonely and bored, or if they genuinely brought me joy and fulfillment. That can be a hard distinction to make but for me it was a gut feeling once I actually thought about it deeper.
3. **Get a pet/plant:** I know this isn't a feasible option for everyone on here but having a furry friend gave me a "purpose" and a "reason" to get out of bed everyday. If I want to sleep in or pretend I don't exist my cats wont let me because they want to play, give me love and cuddles and I have to make sure their food and water is full. It forces me to get out of bed every morning whether I want to or not. I know dogs and cats may not be doable in every living situation but even something as small as a hamster or fish will force you to stick to a routine, distract you and bring you more joy. This also applies to a plant, which is a more practical option for a majority of people, especially if you don't have the kind of money to take care of an animal.
4. **Recognize your signs:** What I mean by that is recognize what behavior patterns you fall into that lead you to spiral into a depression episode. A common one for me (and a lot of other people on here) is not taking care of myself such as, oversleeping, not eating for days, not showering, not responding to loved ones for days, cancelling plans, calling sick into work etc. Once I recognized these sequence of behaviors were a result of me not keeping myself in check, I was able to counteract them with other behaviors, which has been one of the hardest things I've had to learn... Which leads me to #5.
5. **Changing toxic behavior:** Believe me, I know how easy it is to sink deeper and deeper into the pit. I'm sure for some of you (like for me) the pit is comfortable at this point and getting yourself sounds more scary and daunting than letting yourself go. Circling back to #3 I have found ways to *forcing* myself to do things besides lay in bed and pretending to not exist. I now set a routine for myself after work on Monday I meal prep for the entire rest of the week. One, it forces me to do something after work that's out in public (grocery shopping), two, it forces me to do something around the house besides laying around and three, over the years I've actually grown to have fun doing it. I throw on a funny TV show, watch YouTube, listen to audio books or listen to music. That's just one example of something practical and that most everyone can do to force yourself to stay productive. You will spend less money on food as well instead of eating out all the time, and I have a harder time justifying skipping 2-3 days of food to avoid my food from spoiling (I'm a penny pincher).
6. **Having something to look forward to:** A reoccurring theme to me is to keep busy and productive so I don't feel so stagnant and idle. For me I try to constantly have at least 1-3 things planned at any given month (preferably more than 1-3). Of course think of things that YOU are interested in but some examples of things I do are: concerts, local attractions in your area (my area has a zoo, small theme park, farmers markets), camping, conventions, trying now restaurants etc.
7. **Bad days will happen:** When all of this is said and done, I still have those bad days/weeks. It's just important to realize that they wont last forever, if you're willing to fight fucking hard for better days. It's okay to cry, it's okay to take a break and "grieve" so to speak. Circumstances and situations can definitely trigger bad days/weeks, but reverting back to #4 and #5 you need to recognize if it's just a bad day/week or something more.
8. **Self-love/Self-care:** If any of you are like me this is a tough one, especially if that little voice in your head tells you you're not good enough. After telling yourself that enough times over several years it's hard to convince yourself otherwise. I guess the most important part about this is baby steps so it eventually becomes second nature. Instead of just getting out of bed lifeless and putting on the first thing you see, pick out an outfit that gives you full confidence. Instead of running out the door without doing your hair or makeup, take that extra 10 minutes to build that confidence. Instead of coming straight home after work, treat yourself to a scenic drive or your favorite soft drink at the drive thru. Instead of comparing yourself to other's accomplishments, recognize your own and CELEBRATE them. There is NOTHING wrong with being happy with an accomplishment and celebrating it.
9. **Perspective:** My best friend struggles with insecurity, anxiety and comparing herself to others around her (as I do and have in the past) and hearing her accounts made me realize that what she was insecure and anxious about were things I had no idea about. I never focused on her physical appearance, I was always proud of her work ethic, her sense of humor, her tenacity etc. but all she saw was failure. It made me realize that the people that care most about you don't see those "flaws" that keep you up at night.

Another side of **Perspective:** This may not apply to everyone, but I'd say a majority of people were taught a certain standard of living to be deemed "acceptable". Whether that was by their parents, religious affiliation, school, social groups etc. With an ideal ingrained in your subconscious in your development years, it can be hard to shake even if you grow up and choose not to take that path. For example: Growing up in a large, religiously affiliated family I always believed that I would graduate high school, meet a husband and start a family together. Once I reached adolescence I realized that wasn't the choice I wanted to make with my life. For years I dealt with self-loathing and pain, thinking I wasn't choosing the right path even though staying with the faith isn't what I truly wanted. These pre-conceived ideas of success and happiness I was taught at such a young age wasn't success and happiness to me anymore, and that terrified me but I didn't even know it. I had to completely rearrange what happiness meant to me instead of relying on other people around me to define it on my behalf. I had to convince myself that my tattoos and piercings were okay. That drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis is okay in moderation and totally normal. After years of self loathing and self harm I convinced myself that being openly sexual with my partners is biologically normal and acceptable if done with the right intent and people. A lot of these revelations I learned through journaling.

I could write dozens of more things that have helped me throughout my 10-15 year journey. I can honestly say (fingers crossed) that every year that I work on myself the happier I am and the less episodes I slip into. I know this post is long enough but everyone on here has to know that none of this is easy. You have to fight for yourself and work on these things every day for long lasting results. You do deserve happiness even if you and everyone around you is telling you otherwise. â™¥
