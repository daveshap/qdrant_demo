Monitor sleep on MacBook with Ubuntu Server w/o X My old MacBook should be used as a home server. How can i activate a display sleep on the console. There is no X installed. It's the first time I'm using a cli only installation.At the moment there is a 17.x version installed, I want to upgrade it to 18.4 if I can solve the display problem. I don't need the \"light\" in my network rack :-)I don't know how to start a search for this topic because it's quite special with a Notebook :-)kr basti
