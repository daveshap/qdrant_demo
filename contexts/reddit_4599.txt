My puppy died
Today is an awful day. Started with my work from home job task that I wasnt able to solve on my own (it was petty, I'm a software developer), me being stupid not reading about hidden fees on shipping of products i bought abroad of which I intend to start a business with, not being able talk to my boyfriend whom I havent seen for months due to Quarantine protocols in my country, and my pet who died just hours ago because of a mistake im partly responsible of ðŸ˜¢ i know a lot of people are going through something much much worse, but I just need to speak it out as I dont have someone to cry on right now. :(
