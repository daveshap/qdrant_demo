Has anyone else struggled with post-graduation depression?
After 6 grueling and mentally taxing years I finally graduated college a few weeks ago. While I am proud of myself, I don't feel as good as I thought I would. I didn't expect my depression/anxiety to be magically lifted, but I did expect it to get slighter better. Honestly, it's gotten much worse. After graduating with a degree I wasn't 100% sure of and an unfavorable internship in my area of study I feel hopeless (I have a part-time job, but it's certainly not my career path and is unreliable due to the pandemic). I feel I have no career path and that I'll be stuck in this cycle forever.

I don't know my direction in life and I don't even know how to find one. I can't picture myself happily in any career path. Even job searching online causes immense panic attacks. The thought of interviewing for a job makes me physically ill. 

My friends (most of whom graduated on time years before me) have already started their careers and I feel like I'm stuck in the mud...unable to lift my feet off the ground. It takes a lot for me to get out of bed and I feel my family is disappointed in me. I fear my friends think I'm lazy and unmotivated but I'd feel silly telling them how I feel at this moment. It's gotten to the point where I avoid dating (pre-pandemic, I have been following social distancing guidelines) because I feel like a failure when I tell people I don't know what I want to do. I even avoid talking to family members because I dread the career questions and I feel it's strained some of my relationships.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? (Edited for spelling errors)
