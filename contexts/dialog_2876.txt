BETH: How are you, Nick?
NICK: I'm fine. Come on, Beth! You know I'm fine! How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
BETH: As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose. Sit down, Nick.
NICK: It's bullshit. You know it is.
BETH: I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
BETH: So -- how are things?
NICK: Things are fine. I told you. They're fine.
BETH: How is your -- personal life?
NICK: My sex life is fine. My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
