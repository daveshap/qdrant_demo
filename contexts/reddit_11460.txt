Why do people treat me this way?
I am one of those human beings that have never had a true friend before because people judge me for being myself and telling them who i am. I just dont know why people are assholes to me all the time. Is it right for me to get this? Why do people not understand? Why doesnt anyone care for people who have a hard time socializing. I have autism and it does hinder my socialization experience by people thinking im weird or stupid. I dont want any advice here i would like real friends who understand me. Yes it really bugs me that people arent nice to me. I tried keeping it to myself for the last 2 decades and i cant take it anymore. I dont want to date i just want true friends. People is this too much to ask for? Why are people so hard to work with? Again I dont want advice i want REAL FRIENDSðŸ˜¥. Please if you really hate society like me and want to get to know me just send me a pm and look at my profile.
