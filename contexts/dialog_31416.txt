JAMES LEER: Want a bite?
GRADY: No thanks.
JAMES LEER: That's why you're having them. Your spells.
GRADY: Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
JAMES LEER: What would you call them then?
GRADY: I don't know... 'Episodes.'
JAMES LEER: It's because you don't eat.
GRADY: I eat.
JAMES LEER: When?
GRADY: When nobody's looking.
