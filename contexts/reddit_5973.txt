What are some career paths for people with degrees in gender or queer studies?
I’ve often heard people tell me that a degree in gender studies, women’s studies, or queer studies is a useless degree and that there aren’t a lot of options out there when it comes to jobs. I’m open to that sort of feedback because I know it’s not as straightforward as degrees that have a clearer path like becoming a doctor or something. 
But with all that said I am still very much interested in getting a degree in queer studies because I would still love to have that a degree in something that is precious to me under my belt. I’m not sure what I want to do specifically yet but I know this is something I want to learn about and I know I would love for my future job to involve helping and supporting the LGBT community.
I would love to hear from people who have a degree in gender studies and hear about what paths they’ve taken after their degree and what sort of options are out there with that degree. All feedback is welcome though as long as you’re kind about it! 
Thank you everyone!
