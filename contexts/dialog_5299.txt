ACE: She's my wife. Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
LESTER: Yeah, yeah. I know that.
ACE: You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
LESTER: Okay.
ACE: You fuckin' piece of shit.
LESTER: Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?
ACE: You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him? He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.' He didn't say that to you, did he?
GINGER: No, he didn't.
ACE: Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'
