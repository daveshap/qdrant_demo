NORMAN: What are you doing here?
CLAIRE: There were some noises. I didn't want to disturb you.
NORMAN: What do you mean? Some noises where?
CLAIRE: In the house. I was scared.
NORMAN: Did you call the police?
CLAIRE: No. Can you drive me home? I'll bring you back in the morning.
NORMAN: Of course.
CLAIRE: It was there. This angry music all by itself. And I heard whispering.
NORMAN: What kind of whispering?
CLAIRE: I don't know. Just...whispering.
