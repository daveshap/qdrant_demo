QUINN: So what have we got?
M.J.: It's not the same guy. It should be a self-solver. No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different. The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom. This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head. Sexually assaulted. The others weren't molested that way. We're waiting for the sperm tests...
QUINN: Christ. How old are you? You sure you want to be in this line of work?
M.J.: You're damn right I do.
QUINN: Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on? You got no discipline in your operation.
M.J.: I'm sorry it had to come to your attention. I am dealing with it.
QUINN: Where you going?
M.J.: Helen Hudson...
QUINN: What the hell you need her for?
M.J.: Because I think I'm wrong.
