War/Terrorism where Pocket Calculator Deletes Reality I may have read this novel/novella in the &rsquo;80s or &rsquo;90s, not sure exactly. The setting was mostly in a near-future Connecticut, but not entirely.The premise was that someone had invented a way to &ldquo;delete&rdquo; chunks of reality using a gizmo no more complicated than a pocket calculator; when you deleted a chunk of reality, it didn&rsquo;t magically adjust physical records of its existence, but nobody would remember it. It was just as easy to undelete the chunk of reality, which would also restore people&rsquo;s memories of it - but only the gizmo that deleted a chunk could undelete it.The story was mostly about a civil war (Beirut-style, not US-1860-style) or terrorism conducted with these gizmos.
