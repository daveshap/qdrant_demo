My boyfriend just told me out of nowhere he woke up and was sad he was still alive.
And when I say out of nowhere I really mean it. He had never shown any signs of being that negative before... and then he essentially has heart failure and lands up in hospital a few hours later.

I had no idea it was that bad. I thought we were working through the occasional negative thoughts and getting better.

I have no idea what to do or how to help. I just want him to be okay
