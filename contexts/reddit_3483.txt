Shrek storytime
Shrek at bedtime

So my girlfriend struggles with sleeping, especially now that Covid-19 is about and we are actually in isolation.
So last night she asked me to tell her a bedtime story to help her sleep.
I was feeling super tired and considered just saying no, but I decided that if it was for her I could do my best.
So what better story than Shrek? 
My storytelling skills are by no means legendary, but it made me really happy when, after talking in my Shrek accent, she burst out laughing, told me she was falling asleep now but couldn’t help but laugh at my impression, and hugged me until she fell asleep.
Super wholesome and I didn’t know who else to share it with.
