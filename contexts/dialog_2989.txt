BASQUIAT: Naa..
ALBERT MILO: Let's get out of here.
BASQUIAT: See ya in an hour. So what do you think?
MARY BOONE: Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
BASQUIAT: I'm here.
MARY BOONE: OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
ALBERT MILO: This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
BASQUIAT: Do you ever get sick of it?
ALBERT MILO: Of what?
BASQUIAT: The whole thing â€“ painting.
ALBERT MILO: No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
BASQUIAT: What about the shit they write?
ALBERT MILO: You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
BASQUIAT: I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
ALBERT MILO: As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
