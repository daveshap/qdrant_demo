There is a guy I really like that has a daughter... I don't know how I feel about it yet.
I met this wonderful guy weeks ago, we instantly clicked. It is very rare for me to have chemistry in all subjects with someone, he makes me laugh & I make him laugh. He looks for me which is great! I usually do the man-hunting and I really like that about him, I feel that he likes me just as much as I like him. But he has a daughter, she is about 4 years old. I don't really know how I feel about it just yet, and I can't control the feeling of "oh" I get every time he mentions "I have to drop off my daughter at my Baby Mama's house". I've noticed there is also that small awkward silence that seems like an eternity right after it's mentioned also. I tried having a conversation with him about it, like asking him what she's like and he'll tell me stories, but I feel like I have to force my self to be interested in that topic. I know the little girl isn't at fault, it's just me.
