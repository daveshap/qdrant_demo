For those who are confused, the Constitution splits up power between three branches of government.  The Executive, the Legislative and the Judicial.  Each one has *enumerated* powers, meaning powers explicitly written into the Constitution for that branch to exercise.  In theory, this would help stop the concentration of power into one branch.  However, overtime, Congress has delegated powers to the Executive branch (as well as to its independent agencies) to carry out laws created by the Legislative branch; these powers are sometimes referred to as apart of the "Administrative State".  For those wanting more information before posting, I've been given permission to show an Intelligence Squared debate on the subject.
