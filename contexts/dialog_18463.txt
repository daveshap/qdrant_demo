COBB: Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
LONGFELLOW: Entertainment?
COBB: Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
LONGFELLOW: What're you talking about?
COBB: Women! Ever heard of 'em?
LONGFELLOW: Oh.
COBB: Name your poison and I'll supply it.
LONGFELLOW: Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
COBB: Okay, you're the boss. When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
LONGFELLOW: He talks about women as if they were cattle.
WALTER: Every man to his taste, sir.
LONGFELLOW: Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
WALTER: Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
LONGFELLOW: Twenty! What did he do with them?
WALTER: That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
