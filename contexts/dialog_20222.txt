KATE: So what's in a name? I wanna join him. I don't see why we can't join him.
FAITH: I told you. If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy. I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
KATE: Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
FAITH: Because I'm the one who's single.
KATE: I never even got to be single.
FAITH: Sure you did.
KATE: Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
FAITH: Okay, okay. You join him. But first will you ask if he's here?
KATE: He's heeeeeerrre...
FAITH: Oh my God. Where?
KATE: He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us. He's wearing a navy jacket. If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
FAITH: Is he looking at us?
KATE: Nope.
