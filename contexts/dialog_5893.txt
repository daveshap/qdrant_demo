EMMA: Yes.
GITTES: I've been wanting to meet you.
EMMA: Why?
GITTES: Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
EMMA: I'm not.
GITTES: Well you own a lot of land.
EMMA: Not anymore. Oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in Long Beach, but we lost it.
GITTES: That's just lovely.
EMMA: Thank you...
GITTES: Where did you get this material?
EMMA: The apple core club.
GITTES: The apple core?
EMMA: No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.

EMMA: Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but â€“-
GITTES: But what?
