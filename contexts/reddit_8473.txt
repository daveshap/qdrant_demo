Who at the Justice Department handles a criminal referral related to the Attorney General?
Today the [Judiciary Committee announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/us/politics/house-contempt-attorney-general-barr.html) that they plan to vote Wednesday on [a resolution](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/FINAL%20BARR%20Contempt%20Report%20Barr%205.6.19.pdf) holding Attorney General William Barr in contempt for failure to comply with [a subpoena to produce an unredacted copy of the Mueller report and the underlying materials.](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Mueller%20Report%20Subpoena%204.18.19.pdf)

The contempt resolution directs the Speaker of the House to certify the report of contempt pursuant to 2 U.S.C. §§ 192 and 194

Those provisions say:

>[Sec. 192:](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/192) Every person who having been summoned as a witness by the authority of either House of Congress to give testimony or to produce papers upon any matter under inquiry before either House, or any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, or any committee of either House of Congress, willfully makes default, or who, having appeared, refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 nor less than $100 and imprisonment in a common jail for not less than one month nor more than twelve months.

>[Sec. 194:](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/194) Whenever a witness summoned as mentioned in section 192 of this title fails to appear to testify or fails to produce any books, papers, rec­ords, or documents, as required, or whenever any witness so summoned refuses to answer any question pertinent to the subject under inquiry before either House, or any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, or any committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress, and the fact of such failure or failures is reported to either House while Congress is in session or when Congress is not in session, a statement of fact constituting such failure is reported to and filed with the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House, it shall be the duty of the said President of the Senate or Speaker of the House, as the case may be, to certify, and he shall so certify, the statement of facts aforesaid under the seal of the Senate or House, as the case may be, to the appropriate United States attorney, whose duty it shall be to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action.

If the resolution is passed by the Committee and/or the full House, and a referral is made for prosecution, who at the Justice Department would have ultimate say over it?  [DoJ ethics rules](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/government-ethics-outline) require that:

>No DOJ employee may participate in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution, or who would be directly affected by the outcome. 

Since this would be a case of a prosecution decision of Barr, would Barr need to be recused from it?  If he were recused who at DoJ would then make the charging decision?

Would other DoJ officials who participated in the decision also need to recuse?  For example [the letter declining to provide the subpoenaed materials](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Response%20to%20Chairman%20Nadler%20subpoena_1%20May%202019.pdf) is signed by Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd.  Would he need to recuse from the decision?
