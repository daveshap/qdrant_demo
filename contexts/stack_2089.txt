work experience vs work experiences I often see these 2 terms are used interchangeably.It's very clear to me that 'work experiences' refers to specific job positions as opposed to the more abstract term work experience, which can be related to skills and the ability.    Just to confirm, is this correct?Note that this question isn't about differentiating experience(s), but is 'work' oriented.
