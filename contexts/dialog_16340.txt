HOLLIS: There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
SAM: --Santiago.
HOLLIS: Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
FENTON: They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
HOLLIS: That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people. Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
SAM: That so?
HOLLIS: She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
FENTON: Tell that one, Hollis--
HOLLIS: Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
