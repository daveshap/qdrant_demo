WIDOW: Don Francesco. You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge. But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted. He never speaks.
DON FRANCESCO: I'm not afraid of his words.
WIDOW: He is weak.
DON FRANCESCO: He will grow strong.
WIDOW: The child cannot harm you.
DON FRANCESCO: He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
