Where are good places to do work experience for a 16 year old?
 

My interests are:

Music, Philosophy, Psychology

Some career paths I'm considering:

Dentist, Lawyer (Yep, I'm a skanky Asian)

I had the option to do a week of work experience and I really want to take it so I can learn some skills and so I can skip out on school.

Have any of y'all done work experience at places before; and what sort of things did you do?

Thank you

(btw, I'm in Australia)
