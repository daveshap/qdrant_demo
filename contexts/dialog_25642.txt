JENNY: Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
STAR MAN: I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
JENNY: Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
STAR MAN: I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
JENNY: We'll get a ride in the morning.
