How to share accurate location with Geodjango I am new to GIS and have been working on a webapp for location sharing. I want to be able to have my users be able to \"Pin\" their location in a map. For this I installed Geodjango/PostgreSQL/Postgis did the Geodjango tutorial and have a fully working map.My problem is that I am not sure what the next step should be to be able to get the request the user's information (their location) when they decide to \"pin\" the location and be able to accurately put it on the map. I am using django 1.11
