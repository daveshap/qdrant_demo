DMITRI: I see. That was an important list, wouldn't you say? The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge. And you lost" it?"
MAX: I'm sorry.
DMITRI: Sorry?
DMITRI: Tell me, Vincent. Do you believe in Santa Claus?
MAX: Can't say that I do.
DMITRI: Neither do I. But my children, they're still young. Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas? His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids. That was Black Peter's job. He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night. And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door. That was a warning. If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
