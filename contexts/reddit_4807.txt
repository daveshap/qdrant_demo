Drunk and sad, wrote a paragraph and was wondering how many feel the same.
Warning: drunk so the writing may not be too coherent.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is certainly hard to accept ones flaw, especially because most of the times that single flaw ends up at the center of it all and you start using it as an excuse for everything else.  
Why you can't do this and why you can't do that.  
Everything ends up being caused by that one thing, to the point where you think about how life could be were it not for \*this\*.

You would obviously be more successful, lead a better life and be more social,

but would you?  
How much do you let your own faults dictate what you can and can't do in life.  
How much time have you lost just sulking in your own sadness instead of trying to do something.

Of course I am a hypocrite too, writing about this is extremely easy while actually taking action for yourself, well, that's a whole other story.  
I never did manage to do it (take action, that is) yet advising others with the knowledge of my own struggles seems so easy.  
The answer is right there, in plain sight, with nothing stopping you from reaching it. But then you do try to reach it you suddenly understand how hard it actually is.  
Sometimes I wonder, if I do take that leap, if I do reach the solution, would it be so simple? No, it isn't something that clicks and suddenly your whole life gets better, that would be too easy. Instead it's something extremely hard, that you have to keep up for the rest of your life; and the only thing going for it, it's that every day it becomes a little bit easier.  
Maybe you did try it, you did try to get better but you relapsed into the old habits and the old sulking, then you also understand how easy it is to lose all the progress you tried to make.  
So there you are, or even, there I am; in what seems like a bottomless pit of sadness that you can never reach out of, but can always fall deeper in.  
What are you doing there? Waiting and hoping for something to change? Attempting suicide? Or maybe, like me, you just ask yourself why you can't seem to free yourself from it, why does everyone else look like they managed it while you can't. Is it just easier for other people? Did they have to struggle less than you? Or are you not good enough, are you not strong enough to do it. But why? Why would you not be good enough? Afterall you were born like that, were you not? Oh, maybe that's too easy; blaming it on how you were born, putting the blame off from your shoulders. No, that doesn't seem right, you should have to bear all that weight, after all you deserve it don't you?  
So you are here, after all the thoughts you've had, still in the same pit.  
Living life one day after the other, but without any lasting joy, just going on with your life in autopilot mode, trying to sleep as much as possible to avoid living, while not having the courage, or perhaps selfishness, to end it.
