I got the job, why is it taking so long to start?
A bit short of 2 weeks ago I was interviewed and hired, then came back the next day to sign papers, give bank info etc. I was then told it would take time for my papers to process with HR... and I can't start my first day until they've done so. I haven't worked in so long, the wait is making me worried. Are they going to reject me after they already chose me? Did something go wrong with my forms? is this normal?

I really like the environment there and management seems really nice keeping me updated regularly. Anxiety has stopped me from working for years but I want to work here for a long time to improve myself.
