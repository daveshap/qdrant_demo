When to follow up on an RLC interview
Hello student life friends!

I've been out of student life for a few years (was an RA for 3 years, graduated and tried a few things but want back) and had an awesome interview Friday for an RLC position. I know the old RLC is leaving soon and I'm pretty sure I was their last interview. Around 8pm I sent a thank you to the RLM and other hiring manager. When would it be appropriate to follow up again and see where they are in the process?
