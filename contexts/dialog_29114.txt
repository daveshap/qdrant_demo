NUMBER THREE: I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
HARMSWAY: ...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
NUMBER THREE: Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.
HARMSWAY: ... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
NUMBER THREE: No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
HARMSWAY: You disappoint me, Number Three.
NUMBER THREE: Please sir. Please -
HARMSWAY: ...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
HARMSWAY: Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
NUMBER THREE: Thank you sir! Thank you!
