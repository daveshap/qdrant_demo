How do people cheat when its so hard to get a girl?
i've been single my whole life. I'm turning 24 in 2 months. I've been contemplating suicide. Life is just not going my way. Nobody is interested in me or pays any attention to me. I'm not ugly or short or fat either. Whenever I tell people i've never been in a relationship or talked to a woman, they become shocked. I've never approached a woman in my life because i am too scared to do it. Its awkward and uncomfortable to me. If I go up to a woman she's probably gonna think I wanna sleep with her and will think of me as a creep. How do other guys attract women? I don't get it. I know I sound like an idiot writing this but I'm just trying to vent.
