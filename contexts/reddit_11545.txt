I hate having to lie to my parents.
So I am gay, and I've only recently started coming out to a few friends. However, coming out to my parents is something I feel horrified to even think about. Not that they're against homosexuality; quite the opposite, they *say* they wouldn't care if me or my sister turned out to be homosexual.

However I feel like coming out to them would be a tremendous let-down for them. They always say things like "You can do that to your wife…" (not anything horrible), "when you get a girlfriend…", or "when you have kids…" etc. Well they have caught on that I have never had a girlfriend, and I'm 18. A couple of times they have explicitly asked me if I like women and I have to say "of course!" while I cringe inside, knowing that it will push back the opportunity to come out to them by a lot.

I now feel more open talking about my sexuality to friends or even people I don't know, but I can't bear the thought of telling my parents that I'm gay.
