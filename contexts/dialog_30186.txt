KUJAN: Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
VERBAL: He wanted me to live.
KUJAN: Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
VERBAL: Edie.
KUJAN: I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
VERBAL: Because he was my friend.
KUJAN: No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
VERBAL: No...
KUJAN: Keaton was Keyser Soze
VERBAL: NO.
