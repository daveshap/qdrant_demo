For those of you that made it out of poverty, did you start feeling happy and less depressed?
I’m off to university (ty God) soon. Hopefully I’ll take myself and all those around me out of poverty. I’m wondering if your mental heath improved. Poverty feels like a shadow that stalks me everytime I dare to feel some joy.
