I could honestly cry.
I made the decision recently that it's time to stop pretending that my mental health is fine and that my once weekly visits to the counselor who spends half of our sessions on his phone googling things I tell him because he's "curious" are sufficient to maintain my functionality. I found a small handful of psychiatrists in the area who take my insurance, a list of phone numbers were provided to me by my health insurance provider. My experiences with said psychiatrists were as follows:

pdoc #1: made "the wrong kind of appointment" through his call center service for my first appointment, after I'd taken the day off of work, and sent me home after charging me a $20 copay that his secretary "didn't know how to" refund, telling me that they could make the "right" kind of new patient appointment for me to see him - 7 months from now.

pdoc #2: was able to see me in a month and a half from my calling him, and when I showed up and mentioned that I've been worried about money he launched into a half-hour tirade about how Donald Trump was an American hero and snowflakes were all too blind to understand his genius.

pdoc #3: called office after being referred by health insurance. Turns out he's DEAD and has been for like 6 years.

pdoc #4: not accepting new patients, despite being listed on my insurance provider directory as accepting new patients.

pdoc #5: not accepting new patients, despite being listed on my insurance provider directory as accepting new patients.

pdoc #6: not accepting new patients, despite being listed on my insurance provider directory as accepting new patients.

pdoc #7: "patched through" by the behavioral health facility she supposedly works for. Ended up connected to the personal cell phone of a strange man who picked up and started screaming and swearing at me before hanging up.

I don't know what to do anymore, it's clearly time to give up on finding a psychiatrist but the prospect of feeling this way forever is hideous.
