How are Delegates (or State Delegate Equivalents) calculated compared to the Popular Vote?
 This may be an easy answer, but I noticed with 71% of Iowa results in that [Pete has a narrow lead in SDE while Bernie has the lead in the popular vote](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/04/802620457/buttigieg-and-sanders-lead-after-first-batch-of-iowa-results-is-released?fbclid=IwAR2yzREF3gIz9MZbaaJ56-1gsm5g_NWj1PlhVM-Lno0c56jD4Ertsglee4c) (I know this is an older article but the percentage differences have remained about the same). Why is there a discrepancy? Does this have to do with not having a full count of votes in?
