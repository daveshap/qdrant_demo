Has anyone tried online or phone therapy? Any recommendations?
Over the winter, I had been looking for a therapist in my city. After reaching out to several therapist with no replies, I just figured I didn't sound like a good candidate to them and I kind of got lazy and put it off. I have state insurance so maybe that's unappealing to therapists? 

Anyway I just tried to deal with my issues on my own and it was working ok for a few months. Then a month later the whole world kinda ended with this pandemic and people getting sick. Now the dread has returned times a million and I feel like I just can't cope on my own anymore. I know there so many others who have it WAY worse than myself. I have only been financially affected. I'm young and still healthy but I just can't pull myself out of this black hole. All my old problems have been dumped on with new problems from this pandemic and now its overflowing. I hyperventilate every time I think about my future and how I will pay my bills (event/gig worker here) on top of all the issues that I had before this.

Does anyone have advice or recommendations for online therapy or even phone therapy?
