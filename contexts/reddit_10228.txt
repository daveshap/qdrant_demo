i just took all the remaining pills of my 5 prescriptions. goodbye.
title says most of it. a month ago i tried to jump off the golden gate bridge and got detained and 5250ed. things havenâ€™t gotten better and iâ€™m just done. this life isnâ€™t for me. itâ€™s my time to go. iâ€™m really sorry to all the people who love me. i feel bad but i cant stick around anymore. i hope things get better for anybody reading this. goodbye

update: i survived, iâ€™m in the ICU right now, they said i wouldâ€™ve died if i didnâ€™t come in. thank you everyone for your kind messages and caring, iâ€™ll try to reply to everyone but itâ€™ll take some time considering :( thank you all ðŸ’™
