ROMEO: Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
MERCUTIO: Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
ROMEO: Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
MERCUTIO: The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
ROMEO: Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
MERCUTIO: That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
ROMEO: Meaning, to court'sy.
MERCUTIO: Thou hast most kindly hit it.
ROMEO: A most courteous exposition.
MERCUTIO: Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
ROMEO: Pink for flower.
MERCUTIO: Right.
ROMEO: Why, then is my pump well flowered.
MERCUTIO: Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
ROMEO: Here's goodly gear!
