When should I start applying to jobs in a city I want to move to?
I’m planning on moving to a new city in August. How soon can I start applying to jobs? I’m a little nervous because I want to change up my career path a little bit. I current do statistical analysis for healthcare, and basically want to do the same thing but more on the business side of things. Since this will be a change for me I’m wondering if I should start looking sooner rather than later? 

Also, I am moving out of my current city because it’s not where I want to be settled down to start a family. How do I prove to a prospective employer that I want to stay in their city? I know my current company likes to know that people they are hiring will be staying around for the foreseeable future, so I’m worried a question about this will come up. 

Any and all advice is much appreciated!!
