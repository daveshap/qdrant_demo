DIFFORD: We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product. We think it's going to be a big seller. But you're the people that make it happen. You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at. It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.
NICK: So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
DIFFORD: A man after my own heart. Straight to the point. What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts. It responds like a human does. It learns. It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
NICK: That's impossible.
DIFFORD: Is it? Why don't you see for your self?
