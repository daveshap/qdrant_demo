TRUMAN: You take Japanese.
LAUREN: Oh, yes.
TRUMAN: Lauren, right?
LAUREN: That's right. Lauren.
TRUMAN: I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
LAUREN: --I'm not allowed to talk to you.
TRUMAN: It's okay. I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
LAUREN: I'm sorry. It's not up to me.
TRUMAN: You have a boyfriend? Of course you do.
LAUREN: No...I, er.
TRUMAN: No? Really? Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza. How about Friday?
LAUREN: No.
TRUMAN: Saturday?
TRUMAN: Actually, I'm free Sunday.
LAUREN: Now.
TRUMAN: Right now? We've got finals tomorrow.
LAUREN: If we don't go now, it won't happen.
LAUREN: Well, what do you want to do?
TRUMAN: I think I've studied enough.
LAUREN: It's beautiful! What are you waiting for?
TRUMAN: I...I can't.
