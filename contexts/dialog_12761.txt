BURNS: Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to. How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
HILDY: What's the matter?
BURNS: Sweeney.
HILDY: Dead?
BURNS: Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
HILDY: Sweeney? Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
BURNS: I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
HILDY: Well, haven't you got anybody else?
BURNS: There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless -- Hildy!
HILDY: No!
BURNS: You've got to help me, Hildy.
HILDY: Keep away --
BURNS: It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
HILDY: That's what I'm afraid of. Any time -- any place -- anywhere!""
BURNS: Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
HILDY: Get away, Svengali.
BURNS: If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
HILDY: Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
BURNS: All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
HILDY: Please! Will you just --
BURNS: Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
HILDY: I'm not working for any other paper!
BURNS: Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
HILDY: Look at this!
