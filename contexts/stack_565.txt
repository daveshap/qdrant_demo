Is it possible to use bluetooth speakers with Ubuntu 16.04? This has been a bad surprise for me coming (escaping) from the Windows environment which I used for my whole life. A few months ago I decided to uninstall Windows 10 and install Ubuntu 16.04 to force myself to use AND start learning Ubuntu and its environment.But hey, I cannot use my bluetooth speaker (Marshall Woburn to be specific but brand/model doesn't matter from what I see). The description of my problem I would like to get help for is simple as that. There are bugs with the bluetooth part of this OS. Sometimes no device shows up in bluetooth device list. Sometimes it is listed there but fails to connect. Sometimes it connects but disconnects after some while.  It's been months I'm struggling with this problem to do the simple things like watching a movie or listening to music and I started to feel tired about this.Is there an official explanation about this bug or some fix for it? If we are depended to a bluetooth speaker, should we avoid Ubuntu 16.04?Thanks in advance.Kind regards, Tayfun.
