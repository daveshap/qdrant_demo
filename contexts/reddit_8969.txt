How dangerous is anti-biotic resistance, and what should the government's reaction be to it?
[The United Nations recently declared anti-biotic resistance as equivalent in danger to global warming in terms of public threat.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/antibiotic-resistance-bacteria-disease-united-nations-health/?linkId=29137110)

It is stated that over [700,000 people die a year](https://amr-review.org/sites/default/files/AMR%20Review%20Paper%20-%20Tackling%20a%20crisis%20for%20the%20health%20and%20wealth%20of%20nations_1.pdf) from resistance, although it's stated there could be far more than that as most institutions, especially those in the third world, generally track the disease and do not take into account how strong the infection is.

Considering the widespread concern for anti-biotic resistance, what can and should the government(s) do about it? And further, whatever plan you believe in, *can* the government(s) enact it?
