Looking to increase my iMac's RAM I am looking to increase the RAM of my iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Mid 2015). I found one on the Apple website, but it is $400. If I could find a better price, it would be amazing. I was looking around on Amazon, but don't know if the SDRAMs I found work with my iMac. Do you guys have any advise for how to tell whether or not the SDRAM is compatible with my iMac?
