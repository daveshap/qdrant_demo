Was the footage received in Star Trek's The Menagerie also an illusion? In the two-parter The Menagerie, it is said that the footage we first thought was a record was in fact a broadcast from Talos IV.What does that mean, exactly? We clearly see past events, so I assume it is implied that the Talosians send an illusion that describes the past. Is that actually the correct interpretation?
