CATES: Whaddya think?
ELAINE: What do I know? I'm just a bartender.
CATES: Let's go, Reggie.
HAMMOND: Do I get to kiss her too?
CATES: If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
HAMMOND: What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit? I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
CATES: I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
HAMMOND: Hey, there she is...
CATES: Whatever play I maker just back me up.
HAMMOND: If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
CATES: Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine. You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
HAMMOND: Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
CATES: Partnership?
HAMMOND: Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
