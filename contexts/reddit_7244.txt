1 Month Free Time, What Class/Certification Should I Take?
Used to work in customer support at a startup that has now gone under. While I search for a new job I want to devote half my days to a class. Any suggestions about a type of class/certification I could get in a month that would help on my resume?

I want out of customer support, my plan right now is to apply for any jobs at educational institutions so I can work there and take discount classes part time. 

Some careers I want to explore: data analytics, UIUX, computer coding. I know, I’m all over the place. I WAS going to do an intro class for each topic (like Harvard’s CSx50 for coding) while I worked customer support—but then I lost my job and my timeline accelerated my timeline.

I will work another customer support job if I have to temporarily but I really really do not want to.

I’ve thought about taking a SQL or Python class, but not sure if 1 month of that would be enough to put on resume. What type of class would look good on your resume?
