How does one go about looking for a job while already in a VERY demanding full time position?
I’m currently paid salary as a media consultant, and am technically always on call, though I usually work M-F 8:00-5:00. Earlier this week, I got a call from a company wanting to set up an interview, but had missed their calls because I couldn’t get away from work. I explained to them via email why I hadn’t answered, and told them what times I’d be available for an interview, which is only ever on my lunch hour. 

They called yesterday during lunch, but I didn’t have a chance to take one, so I think I missed out on this opportunity.

Going forward, how can I arrange interviews while working my job? Calling out sick isn’t usually an option, nor is leaving the office for a few hours.

For context, my job pay’s shit, and I’m looking for a company that treats their employees better. I can do the same job making 20k more than I do, hence the reason for my job search.
