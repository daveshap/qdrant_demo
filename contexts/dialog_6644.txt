ZAMMITO: What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that? What'd I say to him?
JOEY TWO TONS"": You said don't do it, boss.
ZAMMITO: That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So, I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
VINNY: Frankie, I --
ZAMMITO: -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head, not mine. Break his arm.
VINNY: Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
ZAMMITO: That's why we're only breaking one arm.
SOPHIE: There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
JULIEN: I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
SAMI: After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
DANIEL: Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
JULIEN: What about transportation?
SOPHIE: You can use my car.
DANIEL: Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
RAYMOND: No problem.
SAMI: When do we go?
SOPHIE: Tonight.
DANIEL: Tonight?
SOPHIE: I know they won't be home tonight.
SAMI: You ever hear of jet lag?
SOPHIE: Take a nap.
