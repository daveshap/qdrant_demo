Does anyone else get hurt by what people say on reddit
I'm actually loosing my will to live by being on here. my real life also has its obsticals but then people criticize me even when I'm asking for advice on a topic.

On a differnt sub, I asked about why people at work keep babysitting me. they replied "cuz u arent as competent as u think u are". I know I'm good at my job. I just wanted advice. I'm already suicidal. maybe I dont deserve to live if I cant even do anything right. I do well in school and even though I use a site that helps me on homework for an non imp class. I work hard and I have been for years. I've made sacrifices and my health has suffered. and then someone comes along and destroys me.
