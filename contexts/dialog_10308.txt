NICKY: If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
LAUREL: Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
NICKY: I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
LAUREL: Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
NICKY: Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
LAUREL: Oh please. Not now. She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
NICKY: You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
LAUREL: She is kicking you out.
NICKY: Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
