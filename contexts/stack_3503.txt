third party DNS over ISP DNS - privacy issue How does using third party DNS like cloudfare 1.1.1.1 DNS helps to protect privacy when ultimately ALL traffics goes through ISP? ISP is the middle man between me and the internet. Since DNS is in plain-text and all traffic goes through ISP, thus they are still able to see the request. Only at HTTPS level they cant see anything at all. Am i missing something?
