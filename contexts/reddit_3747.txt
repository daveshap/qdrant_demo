improved my life, now dating sucks
In the past few years I have improved my life so much. Doubled my salary, have my own side business, work out all the time, have my own place etc. Generally happy, feeling good, like life is going somewhere. I have the money to go out and buy nice clothes and shit, etc. 

But my dating life has gone to shit. I haven't met anyone in the past two years that all this has been going on. When I ask people in IRL, they seem to cringe at me. I go on dates, but it's like, nobody is interested in a person who has their life on track? All I get is ghosted or rejected. 

3-4 years ago I was broke, depressed, never took care of myself, etc. and I had women throwing themselves at me, like would sleep with several a year, etc. I dressed like a bum, dirty sneakers, oversized clothing, did nothing but play video games, etc. Despite being a 'loser' through all my 20s, I always had girlfriends. 

What the fuck is up with this world? all you ever here is 'improve yourself if you want to date', except, I did, and now it sucks. It doesn't matter that objectively I'm way more attractive and feel more confident... if nobody will actually date me? I don't understand how my happiness is such a rabid turn off to people. 

Even my friends have commented about how much better I seem to be doing and they are really happy for me... and they say 'yeah man makes no sense to me either, i don't get why anyone dated you back then, but now you seem like a real catch'.

My experience is so backwards compared to common sense/general advice. I am really getting frustrated and depressed about it.
