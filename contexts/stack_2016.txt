Do meteorites really land on Earth, or did the interviewee mean that ironically? Technically speaking, landing is coming to rest after making contact with the ground. Yes, but isn't it supposed to be smooth rather than violent?   Ships land, as do planes, drones, and skydivers.Meteorites crash, fall ... uh ... collide with ... but land?<blockquote>  Mazurek said the meteorite came with a barn he bought in 1988 in  Edmore. He said the farmer who sold him the property told him it  landed in his backyard in the 1930s.</blockquote>Did he mean that ironically? \"Meteorite landed\": a quick google search returns 30,000 results.I mean, come on. John Harrington comes to mind:<blockquote>  Treason doth never prosper, what\u2019s the reason?<br>  For if it prosper,  none dare call it Treason.</blockquote>Any thoughts?
