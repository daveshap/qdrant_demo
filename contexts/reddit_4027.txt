I really just need to tell anyone that I met someone
I really want to tell my best friend and/or my sister/ family. *However!* The last three guys that I've been excited about, got at least a couple months into dating, told my best friend and then within a week of telling her, the guy has ghosted me or sent the 'i'm not ready after all' text.

So, instead I'm going to tell a bunch of strangers on the internet about how I met this guy (off Tinder no less) and I'm love hanging out with him, sex is great, he treats me super well, etc. 

I'm just excited that I finally connected with someone that likes me for me and vice versa. Fingers crossed this doesn't jinx anything
