Audit Trail in NoSQL vs. Relational DB, audit trail feature in MongoDB Two questions regarding selection a DB type and engine for the scenario when the Audit Trail functionality is a must:Is there any preference in DB type (NoSQL/Relational) choice when the Audit Trail is critical?Is it a common practice to use a MongoDB in a scenario when the Audit Trail is an obligatory feature?As far as I know, MySQL and SQL Server offer such functionality, but I don't find such option in MongoDB features list.
