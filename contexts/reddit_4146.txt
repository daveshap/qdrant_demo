My method of testing the water
Sorry if this is not the right sub, first time here.

We've all been there: You're meeting a girl/guy, start talking, sitting next to each other, and things seem to go ok. They seem to be interested in you, and you want to make a move, but you're not sure if they are actually interested, or just being friendly/polite. Breaking the touch barrier might be a bit tricky: Touching their shoulder often doesn't have the effect you are looking for, as most of the time it does not provoke too much of a response, whether they like the touch or not. On the other hand, things like putting your hand on their thigh are too aggressive and could be very uncomfortable for the other person.

What I found to be working the best in between these options is gently touching their hand with yours. make a quick contact, maybe run your thump along their finger for a couple of seconds. If they are uncomfortable with that, they will automatically move their hand right away, and that would be the end of it. But if they are into you, they will take your hand, or reciprocate by being playful with their own fingers.

The advantage that I have found with that specific touch is that it is direct enough for the other person to realise you're not just touching them by accident/friendliness, but subtle and gentle enough to not be seen as intrusive or threatening, while giving the other person an easy way out if they are not interested.
