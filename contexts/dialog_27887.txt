MRS. CARVER: Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
HAMMER: Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
HAMMER: Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
MRS. CARVER: When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
HAMMER: So don't show a picture.
MRS. CARVER: You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
