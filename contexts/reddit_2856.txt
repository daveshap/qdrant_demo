Proposed salary cut by 20% due to COVID19, what do I do?
Location: Australia
Industry: Manufacturing
Employees: 450+

Today all employees at my workplace were issued a letter stating our hours are going to be cut back by 20% (work 4 days as opposed to 5). We are required to sign and send back acceptance of the proposal in the next two days.

Is this legal?

The individual contract I signed at the start of my employment states I'm on a salary with a regular working week of 38 hours.

I am in a finance position and I know sales have not been impacted to the extent that measures like this need to be put in place. Maybe the board is just taking precautions, but I can't help but feel they are using the whole coronavirus saga as a cover to cut labour costs for the foreseeable future.

I'd like to hear your opinions on the matter. Thanks in advance for the feedback.

EDIT: through my research I can conclude it comes down to the wording of the letter your company provides. If it's a request or proposal to change your hours - totally legal. You can decline to sign and then face whatever repercussions come of that. If the company does not give you an option and adjusts your salaried hours without consent - not legal and you can take the case further if you wish. 

I hope this helps anyone that's in the same situation.
