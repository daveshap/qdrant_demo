WALTER: I've changed.
VICKI: Why young girls, Walter?
VICKI: Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
WALTER: Their power. They seduce me.
VICKI: They seduce you?
WALTER: I was always the one seduced.
VICKI: You really believe that?
WALTER: No. That's what I used to tell myself.
VICKI: And what do you tell yourself now?
WALTER: Nothing. It's over.
VICKI: Bullshit.
