Anxiety as an older male sucks
Society tells men to be strong, to be stoic and easily face fears. But as an older male with anxiety it just really sucks. I know women won't find me attractive if I'm anxious or more anxious then them, I get it, they don't want to feel the need to take care of me. Also when I'm with other men they see me as weak and often bully and tease. 

Just wanted to vent about how shitty it is being an older male with severe anxiety, socially, makes me even more suicidal. Just want out of this anxious persons body and mind, just want out of all this sometimes.
