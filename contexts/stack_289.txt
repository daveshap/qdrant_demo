External monitor connected via usb-c causes mac to not show low battery notification I have a macbook pro 15 inch (2017) that I connect to a 32\" external monitor via usb-c. Usb-c is also 'partially' charging the mac but not enough to fully charge battery since voltage from monitor to mac is low. In turn, this causes the battery to discharge while power source is set to power adapter.Therefore the mac battery is discharging while connected to power. In this case when the battery gets really low no 'low battery' notification is displayed since it is technically 'charging'. Is this an issue apple should fix or do they expect us to check the battery percentage every minute in this kind of scenario.I was previously very reliant on the low battery notification so now the mac  is powering off just because I am not alerted to connect the proper charger.
