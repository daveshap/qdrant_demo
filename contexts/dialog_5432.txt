SELINA: I don't know what came over me.
LANE: What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
SELINA: Yeah, she's okay.
LANE: Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster. I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
LANE: Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
SELINA: I actually got some memory back last night.
LANE: How much?
SELINA: Enough.
LANE: Oh now this one is mine...
LANE: Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
SELINA: But of course you are.
LANE: I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
SELINA: I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
LANE: Ah! Ah!--God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..
