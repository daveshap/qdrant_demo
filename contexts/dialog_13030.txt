COLONEL OLIVER: Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
PAUL: I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
COLONEL OLIVER: No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
PAUL: Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
COLONEL OLIVER: I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
