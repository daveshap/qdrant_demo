DULANEY: Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
DR. PALEY: We had dinner at a restaurant.
DULANEY: Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
DR. PALEY: No.
DULANEY: You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
DR. PALEY: No.
DULANEY: If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
DR. PALEY: Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
DULANEY: And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
DR. PALEY: Yes.
DULANEY: And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
DR. PALEY: No.
DULANEY: Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine. I would like to play it now.
CARDENAS: Objection. Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from. Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
