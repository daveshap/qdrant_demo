How to maintain optimism after 200+ applications?
I graduated in May 2019 with a BS in History of Science and Technology and with several years experience in microbiology lab work. However, over the last 3 months I have put out over 200 applications and have yet to get a single interview. I've had my resume checked by others and write custom cover letters, but it is becoming soul draining to just get auto-generated rejection emails or to hear nothing at all.  
I have seen suggestions of just keeping ones head up and toughing through it, but I am unsure how to do so.
