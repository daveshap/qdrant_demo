I have been flossing my teeth every day!
I have some sort of mental block with brushing my teeth and flossing afterwards. My therapist says that self-care is difficult because you don't believe you are worth looking after, so you don't invest in yourself. It is hard to stand still and stare at myself for those minutes, but I have been doing it!
