Help negotiating when the salary is far off
Hey all.  I'm a professor right now and I've got a job offer from a company I've done stuff with through academia.

I went to grad school and left my old employer abc inc.  I joined the university (I just finished year one).  Now xyz inc wants to offer me a worse offer than abc inc made that I turned down to enter academia.  They acknowledged they would have to beat my old employer's offer to convince me to leave academia, but I after reviewing their benefits information...I'm convinced it's like a 30-40% differential in pay I'd need to ask for.  They seem absolutely enamored with me, and I am interested in the work they do but I have my line in the sand drawn.  Any thoughts on how you could possible convince a corporation to boost your pay by 30ish percent?
