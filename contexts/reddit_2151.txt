In case nobody has told you this today...
-You’re smart.
-You’re loved.
-You will live through the virus.
-There’s plenty of meaningful memories to be made outside of high school.
-A college rejection doesn’t reflect anything about you.
-You’re more than a grade or a diploma.
-You’ve worked hard.
-I’m proud of you for making it this far.

With Corona and college decisions coming out soon, it can feel like the world is crashing on us sometimes. Sometimes, it can be good to take a minute to step back and breathe. Remember how it feels to be hugged by people who love you, the feeling of warm clothes out the dryer, the way the moon seems to follow you on long car rides, your inside jokes with your friends, the feeling of hitting “next episode” in the middle of a Netflix binge.

My PMs are open if anyone needs to talk. Stay safe and healthy, this virus has us in a crappy situation but we need to think positive when possible and appreciate all that life has given us so far.
