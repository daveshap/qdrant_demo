CARTER: Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
LEE: That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
CARTER: Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like? Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
LEE: Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
LEE: You like it?
CARTER: Yeah, it's good.
LEE: That one is my favorite. Chicken puff with shark fin.
