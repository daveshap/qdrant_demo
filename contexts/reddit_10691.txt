I reach out for once and get fucking denied
I want to kill myself, but in a last ditch I tried the suicide hotline online chat. I was actively participating when the person said they were closing the chat for inactivity. I responded probably less than thirty seconds beforehand. I have to talk to someone online because no one in person believes me, but even that didnt fucking work
