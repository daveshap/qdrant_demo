TYLER: What do you want?
UTAH: Shrimp and fries.
TYLER: I mean, what do you want? What are you doing hanging around here.
UTAH: I need you to teach me.
TYLER: Gimme a break. One shrimp and fries to go! Anything to drink?
UTAH: I'm serious.
TYLER: I can see that. But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at. Miniature golf. Here, your number's 37.
UTAH: Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
TYLER: What is it? You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
UTAH: No, no. See, all my life I've done things for other people. In high school I played football because my old man expected me to. Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did. Football scholarship. Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
TYLER: This gonna take long?
UTAH: Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right? But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals. And I hadn't been living my own life. So I wanted something for myself. Something that maybe didn't make any sense. You know what I mean?
UTAH: I came out here from Ohio a month ago. Never saw the ocean before. I didn't think it would effect me so much. Like I'm drawn to it, or something. I want to do what you do. It's the truth.
TYLER: Tomorrow, 6 AM. Here. If you're a minute late I'm gone. And Stud... I didn't take you to raise. I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
