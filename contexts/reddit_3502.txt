Why do guys do think I'm crazy enough to say yes to this?
I've noticed a trend in online dating. Guys will ask if you live alone or not. Then they will suggest bringing a bottle of wine or liquor over so we can chill and watch a movie aka Netflix and chill. My whole thing is WHY WOULD I BE INCLINED TO INVITE A STRANGER TO MY HOME? And why would they think I would go to their home and do the same??? Stranger danger. Smh I'm not trusting someone I never met before in a space alone. Especially not my home.

Also, I am not into anyone who can't be more exciting than wanting to chill inside the house. At least start off on a more exciting foot.

Lastly, if the person is trying to hook up I prefer for them to be forward and not waste their time with this tactic with me.
