Asking Professors for Multiple Academic References
I’m a first year Masters student doing decently well in my classes but not really involved in things outside of that. Regularly, I come across opportunities (internships, scholarships, etc.) that I would be very interested in applying but all of them require 2-3 academic references (letters of recommendation). As a result, I have not applied to any of them because I am hesitant to ask my professors who have taught me for less than 4 months for references. I’m pretty sure they don’t know my interests outside of their classroom and would likely say no if I asked.  Plus, I don’t want to ask them every single time I come across an interesting opportunity and want to ‘save’ their references for those critical opportunities.

How do you go about asking professors with whom you don’t have a super established relationship with for academic references? What is the general norm in the academic world in terms of how many times you can ask a professor for a reference?
