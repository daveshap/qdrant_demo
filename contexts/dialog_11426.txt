MRS. BRADDOCK: What's happening?
MR. BRADDOCK: Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
MRS. BRADDOCK: I don't believe it.
MR. BRADDOCK: That what he says. Right?
BEN: I'm going up to Berkeley today.
MRS. BRADDOCK: Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
MR. BRADDOCK: Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
BEN: No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
MRS. BRADDOCK: They don't know?
BEN: No -- they don't.
MRS. BRADDOCK: Well -- when did you decide all this?
BEN: About an hour ago.
MR. BRADDOCK: Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
BEN: No. She doesn't know about it.
MR. BRADDOCK: She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
BEN: No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
MRS. BRADDOCK: When did you two talk this over?
BEN: We haven't.
MR. BRADDOCK: Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
BEN: No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
