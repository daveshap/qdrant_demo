What's the difference in 'rollable' and 'normal' basecoat? We got our interior walls and ceilings plastered. Before painting the walls, we've been advised to use a primer / base coat (\"voorstrijk\" in Dutch)  to seal the walls and reduce the absorption of paint into the fresh gypsum. There seem to be two varieties of voorstrijk: one that can be applied with rollers (more expensive), and one that can be applied with a brush (cheaper). I think using a roller is easier, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price difference.What's the difference between these varieties? What makes the 'normal' variety unsuitable for application with a roller? Or conversely, can I just use the 'normal' variety with a roller?
