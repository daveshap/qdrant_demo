BILLINGS: You coming?
DANNY: We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
CARLETON: Fucking Danny, man...
BILLINGS: He's an asshole.
DANNY: ...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>...""
CARLA: And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms...""
DANNY: How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
CARLA: They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
DANNY: Are they still together?
CARLA: He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
DANNY: Is he a Nazi?
CARLA: I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
DANNY: What's he care about?
CARLA: Killing himself.
DANNY: You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
CARLA: That's stupid. Why would they?
CARLA: You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
DANNY: Yes, I am. Basically I am.
