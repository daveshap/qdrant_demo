BARNES: A squid? The size of a whale? I don't think so. Target acquired. Sixty yards.
BETH: What if it attacks?
BARNES: Fifty yards and closing.
BETH: What do we use for defense?
BARNES: We're a habitat. Not a castle. The only defense we have is High Voltage.
BETH: High Voltage?
BARNES: It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface. But we've never used it underwater before.
BARNES: Forty yards.
BETH: But you've tested it?
BARNES: Sure. Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
BARNES: Thirty yards.
BETH: What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
BARNES: What the hell? It shut us down.
NORMAN: Jerry? Please. Stop this.
BARNES: Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
BETH: Where is it?
BARNES: Why can't I -- ? What the hell is going on here?
BETH: What was that?
BARNES: He's right beneath us.
