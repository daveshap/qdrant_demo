SAWYER: Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
SETHE: Make it the way I always do.
SAWYER: Yeah. Too sweet.
ELLA: Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
STAMP PAID: Oh I been out.
ELLA: Out where?
STAMP PAID: Was over to Baby Suggs.
ELLA: What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
STAMP PAID: That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
STAMP PAID: Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
ELLA: Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
STAMP PAID: I know Denver.
ELLA: You sure?
STAMP PAID: I know what I see.
ELLA: Might see anything at all at 124.
STAMP PAID: True.
ELLA: Better ask Paul D.
STAMP PAID: Can't locate him.
ELLA: He's sleeping in the church.
STAMP PAID: The church!
ELLA: Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
STAMP PAID: It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
ELLA: Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
STAMP PAID: Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
ELLA: Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
STAMP PAID: NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
ELLA: He ask, I give him anything.
STAMP PAID: Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
ELLA: I don't know him that well.
STAMP PAID: You know he's colored? What else there to know?
ELLA: Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
STAMP PAID: It's her, ain't it?
ELLA: Her who?
STAMP PAID: Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
ELLA: Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
STAMP PAID: Girl, give it up! We been friends too long to act like this.
ELLA: Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
STAMP PAID: You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
ELLA: I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
STAMP PAID: Aw, no, Ella.
ELLA: Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
STAMP PAID: You was friends.
ELLA: Till she showed herself.
STAMP PAID: Ella.
ELLA: I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
STAMP PAID: What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
ELLA: What run him off? Tell me that!
STAMP PAID: I run him off.
ELLA: You?
STAMP PAID: I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
ELLA: You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
STAMP PAID: He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
ELLA: He knew Baby Suggs?
STAMP PAID: Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
ELLA: And he left when he found out what Sethe did? What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
ELLA: But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
STAMP PAID: That's so.
ELLA: Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
STAMP PAID: You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
ELLA: You know as well as I do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground.
