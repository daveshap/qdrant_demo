REBECCA: Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
ENID: Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
REBECCA: When are you finally going to get your diploma?
ENID: I dunno, but next week is my last class...
REBECCA: Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment... Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
ENID: Wasn't it like eighth grade?
REBECCA: Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
ENID: That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
REBECCA: I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
ENID: We were such desperate sluts back then.
MANAGER: I'm gonna let you handle the four thirty crowd by yourself - that way I can evaluate your performance while it's slow and ease you into the bigger crowds.
ENID: You can count on me, sir!
