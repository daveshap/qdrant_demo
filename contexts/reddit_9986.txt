Looking into Student Affairs career
Hey y'all!

So I've been looking into transitioning to Student Affairs/Disability Services a few years down the line. I'm currently finishing up my master's degree in Occupational Therapy as a fall back plan if SA doesn't work. I'd like to inevitably develop/run a program for students with disabilities at a university... because then, that'd combine my two interests together.

I have an AA in Liberal Studies, a BA in Sociology, and a BS in Developmental Psychology. Unfortunately, I don't have much experience in student affairs, but I was a Peer Mentor for students with disabilities in UG, I was also a homework assistant for that population, both for about 2 years or so. I am currently an enrichment tutor for my master's program - between being an orientation leader, a tour guide for the new class, and a tutor, I did it all under that job title. Unrelated, but I was one of the Editors for our school newspaper, PR manager for this club called Adaptive Intramural and Recreational Sports, did tech support in school for 4 years, and tried to be involved as much as I could in different clubs like SGA.

I'm starting to apply for jobs, but I'm afraid that I'm not qualified for the position. What can I do to better my chances?
