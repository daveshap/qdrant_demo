CHILI: I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
CHUCK: I can't even remember what day it is, man.
CHILI: It's Friday the 13th.
CHUCK: What's the matter?!
CHILI: Nothin'. I was just foolin' around.
CHUCK: Don't do that to me!
CHILI: Here. Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
CHUCK: Will you come with me?
CHILI: Be a man, man.
