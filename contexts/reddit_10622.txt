I made myself cry because of what I did
I planned on committing suicide 6 years ago to the date, 5 years ago next week was the first of 10 attempts in a 4 year period. Well today I decided to delete all my suicide notes today, all of them to everyone I wrote one to; which even includes my dogs :’). I have no backups or anything of the sort, it feels so damn liberating y’all I can’t believe how free I feel now. I cried for 5 hours. This is the first step in the road to recovery mentally and I love it. I couldn’t believe I ever wrote those notes, it’s crazy how much better my life has gotten

EDIT: I just got off of work and I wanted to say thank you to everyone that’s been so supportive
