DEBBIE: Cole, we've got to talk.
COLE: Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
DEBBIE: No, Cole, I...
COLE: It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
DEBBIE: Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
COLE: You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
DEBBIE: Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
COLE: You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
DEBBIE: I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
COLE: You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel? Angry, Deb. Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb. No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
DEBBIE: Cole, I'm sorry, I...
COLE: That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
DEBBIE: I'm going now, Cole.
COLE: I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
