TOM: Is it worth anything?
JEWELER: I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
TOM: That's what I wanted you to tell me.
JEWELER: There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
TOM: You sure about that?
JEWELER: Would you like to sell it?
TOM: No -- no, thanks.
JEWELER: I'd give you a very good price.
