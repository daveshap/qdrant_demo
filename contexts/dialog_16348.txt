RAY: Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
SAM: The shooter local?
RAY: Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
SAM: Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
RAY: Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
SAM: Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
