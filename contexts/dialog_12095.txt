PSYCHIATRIST: And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
STARLING: And. I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
PSYCHIATRIST: ...yes...?
STARLING: But. He was a night <u>watchman</u>. That's what he was. N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>. N'then they took me off. I <u>saw</u>... I saw. Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>? His hat an his badge. Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
PSYCHIATRIST: When?
STARLING: But they were not there. <u>Yesterday</u>. Is that called a Delusion...?
