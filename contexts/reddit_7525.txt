What's a good way of deciding what degree to pursue?
I graduated in December 2017 with a degree in Communication Media and I'm struggling to decide what to get a Masters in. There's just so much that interests me academically that it's hard to decide. Plus I'm worried about choosing a degree that employers won't respect/value even if that field of study is important.
