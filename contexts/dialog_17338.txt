CHARLIE: And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE... I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
TONY: You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know. Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
CHARLIE: Look who's talking. Pretentious bullshit. Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
JOHNNY BOY: Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers. Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
TONY: We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
