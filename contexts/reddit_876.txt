I impulsively asked a girl out yesterday IN PERSON. She told me she had a boyfriend but I'm honestly just proud of myself for even doing it.
SHe's this girl who works at a local tobacco shop. I kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and I'd get shut down. She was super polite and it was all good. I imagine it will be ( a little bit ) easier next time I want to do this. I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.

Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.

Edit 2: Holy Moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane. You all are awesome. Thank you.
