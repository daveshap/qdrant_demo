Does anyone else physical hurt when they try to do things they use to like?
For about the last couple months, anytime I tried to draw or read or just listen to music I’d get this sinking, stabbing feeling in my stomach.... I don’t know what to do but I missing being able to do things.

Edit: Oh geez this got a lot more responses then I was expecting. Thank you! The comments make me feel a little better and seeing that I’m not the only one with these feeling is reassuring. I’ll try some of the things you guys suggested. Thank you again!
