Active duty military feeling trapped and depressed
I'm active duty military, currently age 19. E-1 rank. I join last year at the beginning of june. My rate is ctm because that is slightly relevant I guess. I hate life and am going into constant debt. I am shore duty. I do not make enough to support myself despite housing being covered. I don't know how to get help. Scared it'll threaten my job to say anything. I don't have a vehicle or license and none of my ship mates will give me a ride so I have to uber to work. My work schedule also conflicts with galley times so I have to pay for my own food. I also have a necessary phone bill and internet bill. Also was not paid today like I was supposed to be. I don't know what to do. Where to start. I don't know if I even have the will to start looking. Also been single for the last 3 years. Not unattractive just unlucky maybe. I dunno. I'm jealousy ridden and anxiety filled. I don't know how to do anything except my job. And I'm not even very good at that tbh. Help. Edit: I just go to work then back to my barracks every day. Can't afford to go anywhere else.
