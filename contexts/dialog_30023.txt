DARRELL: What you want?
BOBBY: Open up!
DARRELL: We're closed. Come back when the sun comes up.
DARRELL: What the hell ... oh, it's you. Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over. What do you want?
BOBBY: I want my car.
DARRELL: You got the money?
DARRELL: Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills. And this morning you was broke.
BOBBY: That's none of your business. Get the keys.
DARRELL: I don't want no dirty money. I run an honest business.
BOBBY: Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
BOBBY: All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
DARRELL: No.
BOBBY: Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
