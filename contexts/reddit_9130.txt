Going from $11.50 am hour to $16.20 an hour, I'm ecstatic and scared at the same time
So I've never been above the poverty line until I'm about to start this new job. I've never made more than $11.50 in my life and I just accepted a job today that starts at $16.20. I'm afraid I'm gonna fall into bad spending habits but I'm glad you guys here have been there to help me through some hard times.

Budgeting is gonna be hard
