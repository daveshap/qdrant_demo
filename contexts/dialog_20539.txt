MARION: Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas. It was Tarleton himself.
LEE: I'm sorry.
MARION: I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
LEE: There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
MARION: We saw.
LEE: I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle. He spent too many years in the British army.
MARION: Where is he now?
LEE: Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
MARION: Who's in command?
LEE: I am, I think.
MARION: What are my orders?
