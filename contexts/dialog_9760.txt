FLETCH: You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
STANWYK: I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
FLETCH: Why don't you try suicide?
STANWYK: My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
FLETCH: So why pick me?
STANWYK: You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
FLETCH: Maybe I'm just on vacation.
STANWYK: Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
FLETCH: Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
STANWYK: I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
