PHILIP: It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --
ELENA: I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
PHILIP: Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
ELENA: My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years. When was the last time you rode a bike?
PHILIP: They say you never forget.
ELENA: Forget what?
PHILIP: Forget how to ride a bike.
