Why is healthcare in the United Stated so inefficient?
[The United States spends more on healthcare per capita than any other Western nation](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/nhs-in-a-nutshell/health-care-spending-compared) [1](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/health-costs-how-the-us-compares-with-other-countries/). Yet many of our citizens are uninsured and receive no regular healthcare at all. 

What is going on? Is there even a way to fix it?
