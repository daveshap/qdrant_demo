Antidepressants withdrawal side effects
I've been lowering my meds under doctors supervision, stopped taking all meds for about 3 days now. I've experienced a lot of side effects in the past few years since I had started my treatment but this is very bad.

I know there will be side effects after i stopped taking long time meds but it's pretty heavy that i really need it to stop. Massive headache and dizziness. I feel like I'm slower than I normally am and I feel like i need to throw up every time right after i eat something.

Is there any tricks that could ease this suffering?
