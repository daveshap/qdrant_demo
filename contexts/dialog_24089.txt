MARY PATRICK: We've got to save her!
MARY LAZARUS: We can't leave it up to the Feds!
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Calm down. Think clearly. Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
MARY ROBERT: She said they were from her old convent.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: But... she was a showgirl. She didn't have an old convent.
MARY PATRICK: She told us about one. The Little Sisters of the Moonlight. In Las Vegas.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: All right. It's a beginning. Las Vegas, Nevada.
