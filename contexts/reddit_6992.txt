Should i ride it out for potential redundancy pay or leave now?
I've worked for a large company in the UK for the last 18 months. It's been the best job of my life so far, however it was anounced in April this year that the UK side of the business hasn't been profitable in a long time, and the company needed to make 350 redundancies in total this year. and they also had to make 150 redundancies last year.

I work in the IT department doing 2nd line tech support. We were told by our boss after the original anouncement that these redundancies wouldn't affect us as we were needed so much, so I was pretty relaxed about the whole thing. last week it was anounced that the 1st line team (4 people in total) is being made redundant and their job is being moved to one of our offices in Poland, and now I can't help but feel like the 2nd line team (3 people in total) is next.

I'm hesitant to just leave. I've had a lot of family issues recently (my dad was diagnosed with Brain cancer last November 2018 and died in February 2019) and my boss as the time was incredible to me. He gave me so much time to take my dad to appointments and sort out what I needed to sort out at home, and also gave me so much time to recover after he passed. He was always calling me outside of work to see if I was okay and if there was anything i needed and just being a generally great guy, so I have a massive amount of respect for him, and I feel like I owe him a huge debt. since then though, he was promoted in January/February 2019 and I've had 2 different managers since then, so everything seems all over the place and I don't know exactly what to do.

My main question though.. should I ride it out for the redundancy pay and get a new job afterwards, or should i start looking now and abandon ship? I've never been in a position where I'll be made redundant before, so I'm not sure what happens in that situation. I believe I get 1 months salary for every year of service, so it wouldn't be a lot in redundancy pay. I've never had issues getting employment though. I was a contractor for a long time, and the longest I've ever been out of work was 4 weeks.

EDIT: I should also add that I have not been told whether or not I will be made redundant. At the moment we don't know anything, but i just have a nasty feeling that my team is next to go.
