DAMON'S MOTHER: What?...
FAITH: I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember. With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun... And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
FAITH: There is one other thing you should know about me.
FRANCESCA: Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
FAITH: I'm engaged. I'm supposed to be married in two days.
FRANCESCA: Except possibly that.
FAITH: And, he's a friend of yours. It's Dwayne.
FRANCESCA: Dwayne?
FAITH: Dwayne Pinsley. From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
DAMON'S MOTHER: Oh, right. Dwayne. You're engaged to Dwayne?
FAITH: It just happened. I didn't plan it. I was alone. And he was... there. But now everything's changed. I owe it to him to let him know. I need to tell him.
DAMON'S MOTHER: You're sure...
FAITH: I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
DAMON'S MOTHER: Good.
FAITH: Let's find a telephone.
DAMON'S MOTHER: Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
