WILL: You and Morgan throw?
CHUCKIE: No, I had to talk him down.
WILL: Why didn't you yoke him?
CHUCKIE: Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
MORGAN: What'd you say about me?
CHUCKIE: Shut the fuck up.
CHUCKIE: Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
MORGAN: You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
