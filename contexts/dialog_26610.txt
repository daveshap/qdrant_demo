HARTLEY: I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
MITCHELL: No. A little sugar though.
HARTLEY: We've only got honey.
MITCHELL: I'll...take it straight.
WANDA: Are you expensive?
MITCHELL: No.
MITCHELL: If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount. If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing. It's a standard agreement.
WANDA: Do you have this agreement with you?
