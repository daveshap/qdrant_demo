He is not chasing me, but allowing me to chase?
What does it mean if a guy is not actively chasing me, but is responding when I am pursuing? Is this a bad sign? I tried a few times to not make an effort (for example not text him first) and he will not text me first. But when I pursue him, initiate the flirting with him, he seems interested and responds/asks me out. But it's draining because I feel like it's me who has to get his attention first.

EDIT:

update on situation now that it's almost been a year. After hanging out a few more times and going on another date still getting hot and cold behaviour, decided to not text first and he ended up never texting me. Saw him out of the blue at a club dancing with a girl. Definitely decided not to text him. Until recently I responded to a social media post of his. Little chit chat. He ended up moving away like a month after which is probably why he wasn't that invested in the long run (I get the feeling he was just bored and I was a nice ego boost). He apologised for leading me on. And that was that :)

If a guy isn't chasing he's not that interested, or he's shy.
