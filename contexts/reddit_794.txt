HOW DO I FIX MY FRIENDSHIP
my best friend of like 5 years is really mad/upset with me and i don’t know how to fix it because every time it seems like it’s getting better i do one thing that could be tiny but ends up setting us back a whole bunch and i just want to be friends with her again and make her happy. any advice?
