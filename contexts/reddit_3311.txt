23 year old social worker in LA looking to switch careers. What are some solid choices?
I’m a 23 year old social worker with my bachelors degree, working for a large non-profit as an intensive case manager in Los Angeles. I’ve got experience working in child protective services and employment services, as well as my current position. I’m completely burnt out at my current job and willing to try anything new. I’m also willing to go into a grad program, if it’s the right fit. I’m also slightly interested in HR. 

I’m completely lost as to where I want to go, but I’m sick of the low pay and thankless work in a hopeless world.
