ELEKTRA: What’s wrong with you? Are you crazy?
BOND: A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive? Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
ELEKTRA: What are you talking about?
BOND: Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
ELEKTRA: ...what?
BOND: We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
ELEKTRA: Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
BOND: You can drop the act, it’s over.
ELEKTRA: I don’t know what you’re talking about!
BOND: I think you do.
