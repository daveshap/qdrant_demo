KURTZ: I said get the fuck out ! I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow. He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
WILLARD: You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
KURTZ: That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby Light My Fire...'
KURTZ: Do you?
WILLARD: Yeah, I like it...
KURTZ: I love it.
WILLARD: You've gone crazy.
KURTZ: No. My thinking is clear. But my soul has gone mad.
