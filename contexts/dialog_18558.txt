VICTORIA: John?
BROWN: Yes, ma'am?
VICTORIA: I was told you were in a fight.
BROWN: Yes, ma'am.
VICTORIA: Has someone seen to those bruises?
BROWN: Yes, ma'am.
BROWN: Ma'am?
VICTORIA: Yes?
BROWN: Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
VICTORIA: I do not accept.
BROWN: I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this. I leave for Deeside --
VICTORIA: The Queen forbids it. I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you. Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be. Please.
