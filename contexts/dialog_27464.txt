RICHARD: Everyone ok?
ETIENNE: We're ok.
RICHARD: I think we're about half way.
ETIENNE: Richard - I saw a fin!
RICHARD: What!
ETIENNE: A fin!
RICHARD: A shark fin?
ETIENNE: I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
RICHARD: Big?
ETIENNE: Yes.
RICHARD: Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
ETIENNE: Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
RICHARD: Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
ETIENNE: I'm sorry.
RICHARD: A bit fucking late.
