Was Nagini the only snake which could become human? Recently launched trailer of Fantastic Beast 2: Crimes of Grindelwald has proved that being Animagus (I don't have proper word) was Nagini's inherent quality, not something assisted by Voldemort when she had became Bathilda Bagshot.                            Which kind of snake Nagini really is? What species she belong to? Or, is she the only snake who is Animagus?
