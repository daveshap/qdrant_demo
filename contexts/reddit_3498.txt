How do I avoid over investing in people too quickly
I tend to put a lot of investment in a relationship. Like it becomes the focus of my life. I also don't take rejection very well if someone breaks up with me. Also... I tend to get very clingy and needy.

Is it a lot to want to see a gf everyday?

Idk why I get so crazy in relationships man. I have a really hard time taking care of myself, becoming too dependent on the other person for comfort, love, emotional, physical and sexual fulfillment.

Idk man.
