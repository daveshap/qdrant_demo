Are there any electric fields associated to the scalar fields in quantum field theory? We know that electric field due to stationary charges is given by gradient of phi.In quantum field theory the scalar fields associated with bosons doesn't have any electric fields but while dealing with em fields we get vector E as conjugate momenta to A_u. why there are not any electric fields associated to such scalar fields?
