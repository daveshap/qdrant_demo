JODY: Are you okay?
CLAIRE: I think so
JODY: I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
CLAIRE: It's alright.
JODY: I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
JODY: Does Norman know?
CLAIRE: Jody, she's alive.
JODY: What?
CLAIRE: Mrs. Feur. She's alive. I met her. She's really sweet.
JODY: Then what was it?
CLAIRE: Nothing. It wasn't anything. I've been on edge lately. Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
JODY: Something was there. You saw it.
CLAIRE: Did I?
JODY: Yes. Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
CLAIRE: Hartford?
JODY: And he's the real thing. Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
CLAIRE: No. Jody, listen to me. You have to listen to me. This is not something that I can do right now. Whatever it was, it's gone. I need it to be gone now.
JODY: But Claire--
CLAIRE: Please.
JODY: Okay. Okay.
CLAIRE: I've got to find a bathroom. I'll call you.
MRS. TEMPLETON: How're you holding up?
CLAIRE: Just fine. It's a lovely party.
MRS. TEMPLETON: Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
CLAIRE: Almost.
MRS. TEMPLETON: Wonderful. It's good to see you two doing so well.
CLAIRE: I'm sorry?
MRS. TEMPLETON: I know how hard it can be sometimes.
CLAIRE: Uh-huh. What can be?
MRS. TEMPLETON: Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
MRS. TEMPLETON: For the Dupont Chair. I swear. I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
CLAIRE: No. I'm just not sure what you mean.
MRS. TEMPLETON: There was just...some tension. You were upset. I remember being concerned.
CLAIRE: At the party.
MRS. TEMPLETON: Toward the end. You remember?
CLAIRE: Ohhh yes. No, no. Just a little, you know...We're fine.
MRS. TEMPLETON: Well, I'm glad. Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
CLAIRE: Who's that?
MRS. TEMPLETON: The wives.
