CAPTAIN: Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
RANDALL: You mean Alex.
CAPTAIN: I mean Lauren.
CAPTAIN: Because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
RANDALL: You killed my daughter.
CAPTAIN: An accident, Nathan.
RANDALL: She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
CAPTAIN: I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
RANDALL: I do. Every day.
CAPTAIN: Erin knows, doesn't she?
