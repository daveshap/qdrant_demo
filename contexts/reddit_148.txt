I am very scared of fighting.
I am 16 y old male with a kinda scared personality. I am the "capibara" type of person. So I made a bad joke (on WhatsApp) to some gypsy and he got really angry. He threat me to come to my highschool and beat the crap out of me. I know it sounds ridiculous, but this guy has like 4 convictions and does drugs. 

When I received the threat I had a panick attack and my temperature rose a lot. It never actually happened, but I am afraid one of my old friends from my ex-highschool  will accidentally remind him of me.

Many people said he can't fight and I am an absolute unit of a boy 1.84 m and 94kg. But I am still a little scared. 

I always backed down when it came to fighting, even in competitions (sth like karate). I understand that in the worst case scenario I just get beaten up, but I can't shake this anxiety feeling. I sometimes wish someone to just come and force me to fight them so I can stop being scared of it.

I train to gain muscles and I slowly build up courage, but I am still scared.
