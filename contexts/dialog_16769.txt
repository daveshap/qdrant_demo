DONNIE: ...please...
SOLOMON: Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
DONNIE: This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
SOLOMON: Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
DONNIE: Solomon: I am in the middle of so much. So much in my life and this is -- If you do this, if you fire me: I Am Fucked. I can't really explain much, but please, please, I've worked here for four years, four years I've given you and I'm, I'm, I mean what? I'm sorry I was late. I had a car accident. I accidentaly drove into a seven-eleven. It was not my fault.
