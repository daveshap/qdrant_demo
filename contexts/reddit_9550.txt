earned a whopping amount of money in 2 weeks, am still broke, about to cry
the last 4 months I literally worked every single day, every day. the last 2 weeks i picked up a lot of extra overnights in my part time jobs. then i got a bunch of checks at once from my employers.

for the first time, my account balance went over $3k! pretty excited...

.... and then I paid rent and regular bills, got new jeans $30 and a new pair of sneakers for $20, $20 worth of market-rate toiletries and a small deposit into my 'leave this shithole town' account...

I'm about to cry. 

Trying to remember the positive here, but id be a liar if i said I wasn't frustrated.
