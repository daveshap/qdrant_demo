I want to be a Technical Writer, but Iâ€™m not sure where to start
I originally planned to go off to law school after I graduated from college, but I decided to take a different route. I worked at Apple for a few years while in college and I realized I really had a passion for technology. I enjoyed not only keeping up with the latest products and software updates but also being able to provide a break down of the products and features to individuals that were not as tech-savvy. I did some research and I came across technical writing. I know this is what I want to do. 

I noted Technical Writers not only have degrees showcasing they can communicate effectively, such as in English or Journalism, but they often have specializations in technical fields such as computer science, information technology, etc. Any Technical Writers that have a tech degree? Is a tech degree needed? Or Certification? Both?
