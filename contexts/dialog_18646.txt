LIONEL: I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
MUMFORD: See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
LIONEL: Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
MUMFORD: Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
