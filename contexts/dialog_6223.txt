LARDFACE: Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
ALEX: Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
LARDFACE: Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
ALEX: No, brother. What d'you want?
LARDFACE: What do I want?
ALEX: Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
LARDFACE: Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
ALEX: Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
LARDFACE: You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
LARDFACE: ... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
LARDFACE: ... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
LARDFACE: ... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
ALEX: I'm gonna be sick.
LARDFACE: You're gonna be sick are you?
ALEX: I wanna be sick.
LARDFACE: You wanna be sick?
ALEX: Let me get up.
LARDFACE: You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
LARDFACE: ... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
ALEX: And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
