Reposting because it didn't gain a lot of traction: I'm 19 and am in a pickle between school and the military. What do I do?
So I am currently 19 years old taking summer courses at my local community college after my 1st year at my actual university. After the 2nd summer session (ends about mid-July), I will have 45 credits completed. I am set on enlisting (not going officer) into the Air Force but do not know whether I should do it now (after summer courses are finished), or when I graduate. The tough thing about this situation is that I set myself up to graduate college in 3 years instead of 4 (2022 instead of 2023). The other tough part is regarding the money that the Air Force allocates per year ($4,500) so that would limit the amount of courses I could take along with having to work my job on base.

Having said that, I am having a really difficult time deciding whether I want to stay in school for the next 2 years and enlist after or enlist now and finish school while I am in. I am just barely leaning towards finishing school so that I can work on my doctoral degree while I'm in but, as stated above, this is a really difficult decision for me. I would love any advice from anyone out there. Thank you for taking your time to read this!
