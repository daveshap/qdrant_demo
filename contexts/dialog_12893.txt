GRACE: What did he say?
DAWN: He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
GRACE: I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
DAWN: Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
BILL: What's that?
MAC: Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
BILL: Wow!
MAC: They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
BILL: Who pays for them?
MAC: We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
GRACE: Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
MAC: Happy days. When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
