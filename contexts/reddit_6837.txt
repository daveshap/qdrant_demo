I am a 16 year old from Colorado and I’m struggling to get a job

I had a seasonal job at a garden Center and got laid off because there were barely any customers. I’ve applied for dozens of jobs and have gotten no responses and I don’t know what to do, I really want to work and need the money. Does anyone have any suggestions of what I should do or where I should apply?
