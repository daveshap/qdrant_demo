What the path to COO?
I’m currently successful in the field of finance, but a lot of my clients are c-suite executives and I find the role of a COO to be exciting. If this were to be a 10-year plan, what’s the road to getting there? I imagine strategic planning and management experience are required, but are there levels under the COO that lead to a natural progression?

Edit: title should obviously be “what’s the path to coo?”
