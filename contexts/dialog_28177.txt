AULON: Jeanne, stop it!
JEANNE: How dare you stop me doing God's will!
AULON: He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
JEANNE: How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
AULON: Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
