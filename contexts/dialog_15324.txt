BREE: Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
TRINA: Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me? And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
BREE: Uh uh.
TRINA: Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall -- -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
BREE: Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
TRINA: Why? She's a junkie.
BREE: She was with you after she left Frank.
TRINA: Well she's not now. I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
