I am close to hitting 1.5 years of graduating college and not doing anything related to my degree. Currently, I'm in a dead end job. Where do I go from here?
The past 1.5 year I've been applying to jobs and I've got offers but they are customer service oriented, so I rejected them.  

My BA is in Statistics (embarrassingly) but I was never into my major so I wasted those four years during college not really learning anything. 

I'm not sure if I should force myself to learn stats again from scratch if I'm not really into it (just okay, mer, whatever).

Right now I'm planning to take a community college course in the next week unrelated to stats but I'm not sure if it's a waste of time.
