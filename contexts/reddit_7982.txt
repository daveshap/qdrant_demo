How does PhD funding work?
So I've been told by a school that I need to secure funding in order to be admitted for a PhD program. They say they will provide a letter explaining that I'm admitted on the condition I can secure funding. I feel silly asking this, but is this harder than being admitted? How successful are these kind of applications? Am I barking up the wrong tree?

Sorry, I'm just not quite sure what this step entails.
