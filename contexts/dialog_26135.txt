MAJOR KONG: All right...we're still flying. I'm taking her down to the deck.
MAJOR KONG: Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
LT. BALLMUFF: You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
MAJOR KONG: Can't help it. What's the wind like?
LT. QUIFFER: Shouldn't be bad. Might even help. But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
MAJOR KONG: We'll worry about that later. Okay, I'll take damage reports.
