Are you ever intimidated by the accomplishments or lifestyle of a partner or date?
I'm talking to someone who sort of intimidates me. Specifically I feel insecure when I compare myself to their accomplishments and lifestyle/background.

In a way I'm getting used to this but it still catches me off guard. I've tried to broach this subject on reddit before and in general the response has been "Why would you be intimidated? Who cares." 

I'm actually trying to find people who have felt insecure in the presence of a partner's accomplishments/lifestyle. If so how did you cope with it? How did you learn to manage a sense of insecurity and maybe move past it?
