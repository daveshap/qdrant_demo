GUMP: Worse than the battlefield.
JACK: What know you of fields of war?
GUMP: Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow...
JACK: There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
GUMP: Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
JACK: Stealing his arms?
SCREWBALL: What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
JACK: His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
