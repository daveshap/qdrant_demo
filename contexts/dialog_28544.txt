MRS. WATCHIT: Oh huzzah, the master's home.
ALEXANDER: Do you have it?!
MRS. WATCHIT: Hello, Mr. Philby.
PHILBY: Hello, Mrs. Watchit. You're looking in the pink.
MRS. WATCHIT: Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
ALEXANDER: Don't torture me -- do you have it?
MRS. WATCHIT: I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change. I've laid out your green coat.
ALEXANDER: What's the matter with -- ? -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
