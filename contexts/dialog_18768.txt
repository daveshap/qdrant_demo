BRUCE: Hand me the 3/8ths.
JOHNNY: Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
BRUCE: When I think you're ready.
JOHNNY: When will that be ?
BRUCE: When you are ready.
JOHNNY: Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
BRUCE: Trust is earned not given away.
JOHNNY: RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
BRUCE: Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
JOHNNY: I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
BRUCE: No.
JOHNNY: I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
BRUCE: And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
JOHNNY: You did.
BRUCE: That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
