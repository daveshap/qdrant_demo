I went to the bakery alone!!!
I'm 17 and basically can't do anything by myself. If there's no one with me when I go outside, I completely freeze up. But this morning my mom was sick so she slept a little longer. I went to the bakery all by myself and even managed to order a coffee to go :)

This is such a silly thing to be proud of, I know. But it's a big step for me. Anxiety has ruined so much, but things like this make me realize that I've improved - no matter how little.

Edit: thank you so much for all the nice comments! And I thought my day couldn't get any better :D I hope that every single one of you keeps celebrating your small but important victories!
