The Haven Lite: 13+ mental health peer support chat on Discord
Hi all, I'm Zen and I run The Haven. [www.thehaven.support](https://www.thehaven.support/) which is an 18\+ mental health support Discord chat. We have had a lot of interest from people under 18 in a community like ours, so we have begun one.

The Haven Lite is a 13 and over chatroom for people with mental illness. Join us on Discord! [https://discord.gg/gAGNyFj](https://discord.gg/gAGNyFj)
