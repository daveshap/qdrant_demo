LEE: Oh, great.
HANNAH: You look so beautiful.
LEE: Come on.
HANNAH: Doesn't she look pretty?
LEE: I bumped into your...
ELLIOT: Yeah.
LEE: ...ex-husband on the street the other day.
HANNAH: Oh, yeah?
LEE: He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test.
HANNAH: God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
ELLIOT: Let's go have dinner, shall we?
HANNAH: Mmm.
