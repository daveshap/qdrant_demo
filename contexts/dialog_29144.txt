BOND: Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II. And thanks to your little show and tell - - giving him the evidence - We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
SIDNEY: Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
BOND: Blood or Dutch?
SIDNEY: He was my father's best friend!
BOND: He's killed closer.
SIDNEY: You are seriously deranged.
BOND: Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
