EMMA: You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
ALEXANDER: No, I'm fine. I'm... ... wonderful. Just walking down the street with you again.
EMMA: We took a walk three days ago.
ALEXANDER: Not like this. Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare. And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
EMMA: They are rare... ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
ALEXANDER: The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
EMMA: So it's astronomy now, is it?
EMMA: Heavens, look at that now!
ALEXANDER: I've seen it.
EMMA: Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
ALEXANDER: It's only a machine.
