AOLserver, apache2 I am using 3.13.0-77-generic #121-Ubuntu  x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 for hosting two websites.Issue i faced is:apaches services went down and sites down. When i checked, i got this error in restarting apache services:(98)Address already in use: AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:80(98)Address already in use: AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80I checked all configuration and everything was perfect. I then checked AOLserver process were running.So i killed the process, and restarted apache services again.This is no the first time i faced this issue. It pops in all of a sudden, i had to kill AOLServer services to run apache2 services again.My question is: What is AOLserver and what can i do to avoid such issues in future.I could not find much information in logs about the server.Thanks
