For the love of God, people. APPLY TO SAFE COLLEGES
Seriously, there's still plenty of time to apply. I keep seeing posts about people saying they're not getting anywhere because they only applied to super elite schools and didn't get into any. There are other colleges, you know. 

Apply to safe colleges, if you still really want to go to the one you got rejected from, go to the safe college and get really good grades, reapply, and transfer. The only way that you can be a failure after getting rejected from all of your choices is if you choose to literally not do anything else. 

As long as you get a degree, people really don't care where it came from as long as it wasn't a trash college. Also, just because it isn't ivy league doesn't mean it's trash. There are plenty of schools that are better and have better outcomes and aren't ivy league, ivy leagues are essentially the brand names of colleges. It's the same thing, packaged differently, and harder to get.

Edit: excluding the jobs that require an ivy league degree (stuff like Wall Street), most jobs won't not hire you because you didn't get an ivy league degree. 

Moral of the story: if you got rejected from all of your colleges, life isn't "over", apply to a school you CAN get into and either get your degree there or transfer. Transferring is hard and unlikely, but it's not possible at all if you don't try. Even if you don't get in, you'll still get a degree.
