What to do when you have little passion?
Title says it all, I really feel like I don't have much passion as in I really don't know what I want to do with my life. I want to be one of those people who "don't feel like their working" at work because I love what I do. I just feel depressed most of the time. I literally don't know what I would love to do with my life. I just want to have time for hobbies, spend time with family, and earn a good salary that supports my lifestyle and savings goals. I look at others who were my peers back in junior high and high school and a lot of them have found something. I just hate having no focus because I feel like if I found one goal I could invest all my time and energy into it and it would become possible. But right now I really don't have that. I'm really desperate at this point, I've even shadowed people and researched different paths but always find myself in this position. It's taking a toll and I am really desperate for some guidance. Even if there's some kind of online quiz or something I can do based on personality that will point me into a direction I would love that
