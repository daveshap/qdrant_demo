Probability distribution over items belonging to a subset of boxes I am trying to find a probability distribution that would help me answer the following question:I have N different boxes and K different items. For each item, I have a probability distribution over the N boxes. The probability distributions for each item are different and independent. Given a subset of M boxes (M &lt;= N), what is the probability that all K items a) belong only to the subset of M boxes and b) each box in the subset has at least one item.Thank you.
