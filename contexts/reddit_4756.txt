I am sad, alone and scared.
I’ve never been properly diagnosed with depression but I am currently feeling very depressed. A few years ago when I was younger & my parents were going through a divorce I was severely miserable, would have large bouts of anxiety & often contemplated ending my life. It was a sad time in my life but I am glad to say that I got through it and have been doing great for the most part and have hardly felt anxious since. 

However recently I have been feeling really down & depressed. All I want to do is sleep and I eat because I am sad and bored, and then I become sad because I eat too much. I have gained weight and am so insecure. I have been skipping my uni classes because I have no friends there and my degree is hard and it all makes me so sad. With all my friends heading in different directions I just feel so alone. I think my family have noticed and say things that are kind of cruel, but I know they mean well. They think I have obsessive compulsive tendencies because I tend to pick at my face often & struggle to stop.

I just don’t want to let anyone down & I am afraid to take the steps to become better because I know it will disappoint my family if I decide to leave uni for example. But most importantly I’m scared of going back to how I was years ago, I never want to feel that way again. I’ve never reached out for professional help either and don’t have the money for therapy. Part of me would feel also ashamed in a way if I got professional help. I hate the idea that something may actually be wrong with me, and I hate the idea of having to take meds. 

I just feel so lost and conflicted. I feel like I know what I need to do but it’s so hard to do it and remain consistent. If anyone has any advice at all it would greatly appreciated. Also, thank you if you read through it all.
