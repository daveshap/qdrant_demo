Ever felt lost in your career? What helped you?
I have had 3 different jobs in 4 years and always felt something was wrong. I worked as customer support, sales and now project manager and never been happy. I have changed jobs too often to allow another mistake. I feel lost. Career coach did not really help.

I realize that I am uncomfortable when I donâ€™t feel in lead or knowing all the details of what they are talk about. But supporting and doing repetitive tasks make me unmotivated. 

What I love: Beeing good at something or a product and talk to customers / present it proudly and design a perfect solution for them. Then lead a team to produce it accordingly... I am happy to put in the hours and travel. I feel like I worked 10 years just to think I need to start from the bottom everytime...

Any idea?
