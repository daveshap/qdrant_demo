HOOKER: Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
GONDORFF: You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
HOOKER: I wanna play for Lonnegan.
GONDORFF: You know anything about him?
HOOKER: Yeh, he croaked Luther. What else do I gotta know.
HOOKER: Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
GONDORFF: And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
HOOKER: I'll take him anyway.
GONDORFF: Why?
HOOKER: 'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.
GONDORFF: You can't do it alone, ya know. It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
HOOKER: We'll get by without 'em.
GONDORFF: This isn't like playin' winos on the street. You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
HOOKER: I never played for winos.
GONDORFF: You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money. And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
HOOKER: You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
GONDORFF: Right down to my socks, turkey. If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em. Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
HOOKER: Then you'll do it?
GONDORFF: If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
