CASE: It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
DIXIE: It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
CASE: Bright enough to be dangerous.
DIXIE: That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
DIXIE: He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
CASE: Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
DIXIE: It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
CASE: So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
DIXIE: Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
CASE: No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
DIXIE: Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
CASE: The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
DIXIE: I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
