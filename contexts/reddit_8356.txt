What is the basis (if any) for President Trump stating the special council investigation is unconstitutional?
This morning Donald Trump stated the [special counsel investigation is unconstitutional.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1003637916919320577)

He did not elaborate on that statement, but this comes after letters to the OSC by Trump's lawyers were publicly released. [In those letters](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/us/politics/trump-pardon-power-constitution.html), he could possibly be referring to his lawyers' arguments that the executive branch could not obstruct justice and could shut down any investigation the POTUS chooses. Still, this wouldn't answer what is unconstitutional about the special counsel investigation, and is more oriented towards executive power and privilege. 

> The comments by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani about the legal limits of presidential power follow a report in The New York Times that the president’s lawyers had written a 20-page memorandum in January arguing that Mr. Trump could “if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon.”

> In the memo, sent to Mr. Mueller’s office in January, Mr. Trump’s legal team said that the president could not, by definition, illegally obstruct any part of the Russia investigation because the Constitution gave him the power to end it in the first place.

[Lawyer Alan Dershowitz has argued that Michael Cohen](http://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/382459-dershowitz-targeting-trumps-lawyer-should-worry-us-all), and by connection Trump's, constitutional rights may have been violated during the raid on Cohen's homes and office. This too is a far cry from stating the special counsel investigation is unconstitutional.

Aside from these tangential arguments on the constitutionality of executive powers and a specific action taken on Cohen, what is the possible basis for Trump stating the special counsel investigation is unconstitutional?
