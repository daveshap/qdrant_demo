IPPOLITO: D'Agosta? Ippolito. Come in.
D'AGOSTA: Where the hell are you?
IPPOLITO: I made it outside. I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here. Help is on the way. Just sit tight.
D'AGOSTA: It's a little late, you son of a bitch. There's a friggin' monster loose in here! Get the FBI, the fire department. Find metal cutters, cut through. And bring a cannon. The damn thing is huge.
