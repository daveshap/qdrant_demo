Do employers actually verify education?
I'm currently enrolled in a combined Bachelor of Science/ Master of Arts degree program. Because it's a combined degree, I won't actually receive any degree until I've finished the Master portion of the degree where I'll receive a BSMA, which means I don't technically have my bachelor's, even though I'm considered a graduate student and have all undergrad requirements met. 

I want to start working, so I've been applying to places saying I have my bachelor's degree and that I'm working on my master's. Obviously this could be perceived as morally gray at best. The alternative is that I list the BSMA on my resume with the expected graduation date, but I feel like this is confusing to employers and will also discredit me from any jobs that require a bachelor's (which is basically all of them I'm interested in).
