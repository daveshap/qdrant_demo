Graduation Situation with my University
I am currently a Senior at a small private university in Austin, Texas. For the past 4 years I went from Accounting, Accounting Information Technology, to Computer Science which is the degree I will graduate with. 

I spent my freshman year of college at UTSA (sorry so this is my 5th year total in college, 4 at this private school) where I took a 4 hour German class because it was required there. This will come in to play later

I have been advised by 3 different advisors (because of degree changes) and up until 2 days ago, none of them told me I still needed 2 hours of German which is a University wide policy. I talked to my advisor, dean, and VP of Academic Affairs, but none of them are putting any responsibility of this complete screw up on the hands of my advisors. They say I either have to take another 3 hours at COmunity College or CLEP it to get my degree this Spring. 

To me this is completley unfair that I have to do this. I was never told the past 4 years about this until my current advisor brought it to my attention. I dont remember a word of German and dont have time to study considering my LIFE starts this summer. I am working and doing rigorous course work.

Does anybody know if any legal action can be taken here or if you have been in a similar situation what steps did you take?
