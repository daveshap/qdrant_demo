Nothing explained on the first day?
I started a job today, at a dog boarding/grooming facility. I am in the US. 

Keep in mind, I was under the impression I would fill out all necessary paperwork (W-4, how I’d be paid) this morning. 

Got there at 8, put me right to work. Took the dogs out to go potty all morning. Got told, “Start taking them out.” No knowledge of any of the dogs’  temperaments, no info about them. Just start working. 

Would have been nice to know liability info in case one of the dogs bites. A couple of them were aggressive towards me, and it took 5-10 minutes to track someone down for help. 

The manager there expected me to already know their policies and how to do things and was getting upset I didn’t know what I was doing. The other girl there said she’s super hard on new people and just want people to do their job. I just started; I at least want a chance! 

She said on weekends it’s super busy so I don’t get the”luxury” of a lunch break, so I need to bring food or call some in. (Eat while working, I guess?) I don’t get breaks either. I’ll be working 10-11 hours on the weekend. I can work, but not that long without a break. 

I went home, quickly ate, went back, and asked the girl at the front when I’ll fill out my paperwork. She didn’t know.....she said she didn’t have hers filled out for months. 

So then the manager comes back out and says it could be weeks before my stuff is filled out, and that’s just the way they do things there. 

I said any job I’ve had, I had to have that info filled out before I could even start. She said there it’s different, and they’re all friendly with each other and I shouldn’t worry whether I’d get paid, that it would happen.

I left because I was so uncomfortable with everything. This place is not a chain. 

Is anything normal about this? I will not be going back.
