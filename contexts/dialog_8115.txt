JACK: You're the key witness?
EXLEY: That's right.
JACK: I should've known. What's the Chief throwing you?
EXLEY: <u>Throwing me</u>?
JACK: Yeah, Exley. What's the payoff?
EXLEY: You're the payoff expert. I'm just doing my duty.
JACK: You're playing an angle, college boy. You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching. If they're making you a detective, watch out. Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
EXLEY: What about you?
JACK: I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week. Next to you I'm clean. And smart.
