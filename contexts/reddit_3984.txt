Yeah just experienced one of those "met through tinder" relationships.
Should've seen it coming.

Met this girl on tinder and met up a bit. Talked for couple weeks and Been dating for a month and a half until Found out she was talking to other guys at the time but she "choose me" as the winner. She made us exclusive when she told me she caught feelings for me and made her feel like no other guy has made her feel.  Just from getting to know her and her history with how she would be afraid to commit should've raised a flag. There were plenty flags showing that maybe she wasn't mentally ready to commit. Examples include her not opening up to me about certain things, not talking to me for couple days, being afraid when I recorded her and us getting food and putting it on the Instagram story 

Today, while i spent the night at her house, just silence a feeling of uncomfortable feeling like I wasn't wanted there. The next morning rolls by and I ask her after a hour of her not really paying attention to me, if she was not interested anymore. And she tried to act real cutesy and shy which was really annoying saying "i realize I don't want anyone in my personal space after today and I'm not ready for relationship" and I ask if she even has feelings for me as I see her face is unfazed. " I think that I thought I had feelings, but... ". Bruh. I got up and just left. Definitely be wary of tinder dates. Because I wasn't .

Edit: the thing that suckered me in was that she used the fat L word on me and I thought she truly was feeling some typa way. After all that talk about how she loved me and how I'm the one for her, it never was put into action. And I felt that .



Sorry for the rant.
