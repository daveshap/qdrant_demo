SQL Server - WITH REPLACE What is the difference when using or not using \"With Replace\" when restoring database. I know that With Replace, I would get identical database as backup file even log file would be replaced/overwritten and current content / transactions would be broken.But, what is actual difference; I read somewhere that some configuration for database like recovery model is stored in Master database; With Replace - it can be overwritten! What else? I cannot find much on what is the use of With Replace? Why it is used a lot, most of the developer restore databases using \"With Replace\".I want to clear my concept of restore database.Thanks
