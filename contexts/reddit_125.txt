I don't seem to have the ability to have a flowing conversation with people.
I hate that I'm doing this. Going on an "advice for teens" thing REALLY is not my style, but fuck it.

I can't seem to be able to walk up to a person, acquaintance or stranger, and talk for a good amount of time without them looking very uncomfortable or awkward. They eventually find an excuse to leave. I'm sure that more practice with this will help me, but does anyone have any sort of advice for me? Well, not just me, I'm sure there are plenty of others who could use some help too. I mean, hey, this is a sub for teenagers.
