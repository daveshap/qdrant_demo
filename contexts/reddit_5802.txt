Rebooting your life. Give me tough love, how much will an entry-level, no-skills-required position hurt me if I ever want to go back to working in an office, at almost 40?
As the title says. If this is better for another sub, please let me know.

I need to have a realistic idea of what will happen here. (I'm female.) have a very long gap in my employment record and unfortunately, a history of mental trauma to get past. The trauma is why I haven't been working, in a nutshell.

I recognize I am absolutely not employable in an office anymore despite past experience, unless I want to volunteer or do unpaid internships first. I've retained most of my skills just because I love being organized and do little side projects for myself, but I couldn't prove that without giving away my skills for free and then... I'm not paying the bills.

So I'm looking at the most basic stuff to keep a roof over my head and show I haven't gone off the deep end completely. Cleaning, back-office stuff like data entry. No customer service, I cannot handle that at all at the moment (due to the trauma).

My view is I have to accept that I'm basically screwed for the rest of my life, and I'm not even thinking about retiring, ever. I won't be able to get anything better than those jobs due to the gap and my age, unless I somehow get lucky or network, which I'm not able to do because I really don't have much to offer that I can prove anymore.

Would you agree?
