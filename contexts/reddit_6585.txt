What are the grooming standards at Quality Oil LLC?
I'm currently looking for transitional work between skilled jobs, just something to hold me over and pay the bills for a few weeks. I see on indeed that Quality Oil LLC gets back to employees very quickly and most are hired very quickly. The job is effectively gas station cashier/shelf-stocker I have a slightly longer KC Mitchell-style Mohawk and a goatee, and I don't feel like shaving both or either off, especially for something that only pays $8.50/hr. Anyone here worked for Quality Oil or know someone else who did and can tell me what the Company's grooming standards are?
