Feeling So Defeated from Job Search
I've been searching for my next job full-time since early June, and I am feeling so defeated lately. 

&#x200B;

I got some early movement when I contacted some LinkedIn connections I had previously worked with, but even with those recommendations I was not offered a position. I even talked to a VP at my last job to see about returning, and wasn't even given a phone interview despite her singing my praises and trying to connect me with the Director of the division I would have worked in. At this point I've probably had over a dozen phone interviews, and four in-person interviews.

I don't really understand what's happening. Before this period I took pride in my interviewing skills, I was given offers at almost every place I interviewed at. I'm not sure if it's because I'm now applying for jobs that aren't entry level, or if I'm doing something wrong now.

Does anyone have any ideas for getting motivation and maybe some new traction? I feel like I'm running out of steam, and I'm starting to question my self-worth as a person and a professional.
