Is it possible to host pbix and rdl files on the same report server instance? Just upgraded an existing instance of SQL Server 2014 to 2016. That instance has an instance of Reporting Services installed. My end goal is to connect Power BI Desktop (March 2018) to my existing report server. I've downloaded and installed Power BI Report Server. Worked through the reporting services configuration manager. In Power BI Desktop, I try to pass my existing url to the Power BI Report Server Selection pane. The url that i'm passing is pulled straight from the config manager and I can connect to it using IE. Current error reads: \"We couldn't find a Power BI Report Server at this address\"I've restarted the the service on my windows box, still no luck. Any ideas?
