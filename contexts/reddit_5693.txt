My dad is having a hard time finding a job, after being a video game producer for years
My dad would never want me asking reddit about this, but I don’t have many options right now. 

My dad is over 55 years old, and he has been a video game producer for 20+ years. Back in 2009, he started his own studio, which folded about 9 years later. He’s been looking for a video game producer job for a year, and no one will hire him. He gets interviews on an occasion, or a “test” as they call it, but they all lead nowhere. He has produced many games over the years. Is it pure ageism on the studios’ end, or could it be something wrong with his interviews or resume? I’m not sure what it’s like trying to get hired in the video game business - I work at a law firm. If someone could please enlighten me, that would be amazing. I’m very stressed for him at the moment. Any advice is welcomed.
