Please, I need some help❤️🙏
Hey y’all! I hope you guys are having a great day🙏 I hope that you keep on reading this please. This is my long-ass story that I hope you take the time to read :

I’ve stopped having suicidal thoughts for a few weeks now and I thought I would be able to recover without having any help or any therapy sessions at all. But just last night, I had trouble breathing again and this time no-one was around. I was all alone in my room with my aunt downstairs and my dog beside me trying her best to do what she can to calm me down (cause I think deep down my dog senses that something’s not right w/ me). I’ve had scenarios like these before. The first time, and I remember it so DISTINCTLY was when I sang up on stage alongside my choirmates and I was the soloist at the beginning of the piece and I forgot the first note, so I sang the whole piece a note lower so it affected my choirmates and they got confused and they couldn’t sing along and it was embarrassing. But the worst part was when a male teacher went to me, scolded me, and said “How could you be so selfish?” “You messed up big time” and he just made me feel like shit. He gave us this look that he would give to people who were worthless to him and I approached him and he gave me that look, but I disregarded it and said “I’m sorry for being selfish sir” and he didn’t answer me. At all. And later, I realized that he had talked with all of my choirmates and had asked them what they learned from this experience. And one of my closest friends went to me and that’s when I lost it. I couldn’t breathe for hours and I just kept on sobbing and screaming. He just walked away. The next occurance like this was when this time, my aunt called. I was at our school cafeteria at the time. Both she and I don’t have a great relationship because whenever she’s in a bad mood, she would mutter the words “Your siblings were never as bad as you” “It’s better if you just leave” “Leche ka. Buwiset ka.” - those are Filipino words that mean that I’m annoying and such. And I went inside a bathroom stall and I started crying. When I went out, one of my guy friends had asked me if I was okay and that’s when I snapped and he gave me a seat and he held my hand and I just started squeezing it because I wasn’t able to breathe for hours and our friends were there too trying to give me water and telling me to count until 10. I started telling them that I couldn’t feel anything. My legs, my hands, my guy friend’s hands, nothing. And I couldn’t speak properly. It had been 3 hours already and so I just told them that I was okay and I still couldn’t breathe but I’ll be fine. But when we got to the nurse’s office, I sat back down because I literally was feeling like I was on drugs or something bc I was getting so dizzy and lightheaded and I couldn’t get up anymore. They started bringing in an oxygen tank and gave me a pink pill and they said that it was supposed to knock me out, but it did nothing of the sort, so they admitted me to the ER and they rubbed something on me and I fell asleep. The 3rd occurance was last night. I’M SORRY for this long-ass thing, but if you’re still reading, bless you🙏 

Last night, my teacher had told me that I messed up my project and IT WAS A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT ONE, like literally, but I really flunked it. So I couldn’t breathe for hours and hours and hours and I started throwing the pillows at the wall because my chest hurt so bad and I was all alone and my friends weren’t here to calm me down or get me some help and stuff. What eventually calmed me down was when my dog jumped up my bed and just looked at me. Right now, I have a blade and it’s not cutting my skin like at all. I’m afraid to get some therapy because my parents believe that its only for crazy people. Do you guys think I need therapy? What are your thoughts after reading all of this? Thank you for taking the time and reaching this far. I’d appreciate it if y’all commented something down below because I really need summ help right now. Do y’all experience this stuff to? Because when my parents found out about me not being able to breathe and being admitted to the hospital, they said maybe I was having a stroke or might probably be getting the coronavirus symptoms. But I was tested and it wasn’t a stroke or the coronavirus. They said I hyperventilated. Do y’all experience that too? Or am I just over-analyzing my situations? Stay safe y’all🙏
