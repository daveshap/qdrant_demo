CLAY: I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
WHALE: Of course. I don't want to scare you off. Not before I'm finished with you.
WHALE: Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone. You have a steady companion?
CLAY: Not at the moment.
WHALE: Why not?

WHALE: Ah. A philosopher.
CLAY: Thoreau with a lawnmower.

CLAY: Do you miss it?
WHALE: It's so far in the past now. Over fifteen years --
