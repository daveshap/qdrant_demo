Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it’s mania because it’s so unusual.
Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you’ll know I’m mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I’ve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I’ve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I’m not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I’m not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‘meh’ mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it’s actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I’m not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I’ve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I’m allowed to be happy. I’m allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too.
