LEON: It's too big.
MATHILDA: Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
MATHILDA: Risky business, isn't it?
LEON: ...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out. You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
MATHILDA: There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death. For the moment, I have none of the two!
LEON: Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
MATHILDA: Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
