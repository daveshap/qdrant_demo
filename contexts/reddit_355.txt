My attention span is so short now and i have so much difficulty doing normal things
hi i straight up made a reddit account just for this because its been bothering me for so long, im diagnosed with a few mental illnesses and some side effects do include a lot of demotivation, even from things that i really enjoy. recently ive noticed my attention span is so short like ill be switching between social medias every other post because i find myself bored i cant sit for whole movies and i just start feelijng nervous when i force myself to sit through stuff. ive got so much work to do for school due tonight and im worried i wont get it done, ive done like two out of eight assignments and im so lost on how to not feel like this? any way to motivate myself to do homework? to siot through it and get it done? i have good grades and i dont want them to suffer from this.  thank u :-0
