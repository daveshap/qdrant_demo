Why am I being denied for basic jobs that I know I'm qualified for?
Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I've been applying to a lot of jobs recently (mostly administrative assistant type jobs) and I have been denied for almost all of them before being contacted for an interview (in the application portal it says "others more competitive"). I don't understand. These are entry level jobs and while I have never been an administrative or office assistant, I have had other jobs that I believe make me more than qualified. Why am I getting denied so quickly?
