My coworker just got fired
It was known that he was underperforming but, overall, he’s a pretty good guy. He also has kids to support. I was talking to him this morning. A couple hours later another coworker pings me to tell me he’s gone. I went to check his cube and there’s still a sandwich on his desk with papers everywhere...

We’re not friends outside of work or anything but he connected with me on LinkedIn pretty much immediately after he got fired. What do you say to someone after something like that? I’d like to send him a message on LinkedIn but I don’t exactly want to refer him for another job either. I guess I’m just a little creeped out by how quickly you can get blindsided by something like a layoff (on a Tuesday morning of all times) and I feel bad for him.
