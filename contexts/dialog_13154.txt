SEAMUS: Thank you. I believe she would have wanted it.
MAURA: Did you know her very well?
SEAMUS: She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.

WILL: What was she afraid of?
SEAMUS: Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul. She would hear things, see things...
MAURA: Well it's nice that you were there for her.
SEAMUS: I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
