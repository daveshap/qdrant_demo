My ex came back asking to be friends
I dated my ex for two months and she dumped me, said that wanted to keep me as a friend and I refused and then I blocked her in every social media.

Yesterday (less than a month after the break up) she contacted me again with another number asking again to be friends when I started to move on. 

Now I don't know what does she really wants and I'm still a little mad, because she dumped my ass over a WhatsApp chat. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks for reading and have a nice day.
