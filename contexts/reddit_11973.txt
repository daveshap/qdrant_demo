self esteem issues at work over small things
I was recently hired to a place recommended by one of my family members who also works there. Today, I just started training (computer based), I finished it early, and had literally nothing to do, so I went to my boss for further instructions, he said he was busy so he directed me to go to my sister, which was the family member who works there, she's a manager. It was supposedly awkward and not ethical, there's a rule against that, but we still proceeded. I went to her, she commented that it was awkward and weird, but still directed me to do this and do that, I went and did the job, and felt so out of place and was like "wtf am I doing here?", a customer came up to me and asked for help, I literally have 0 clue about the job yet and fucked up my answer and the customer got slightly upset, then later after my break, I was directed again to go do another job, several customers came up to me again and asked for help, I literally don't know the answer and always had to deny their requests, and my voice was just so weak, it just felt so shitty, I also messed up placing some stuff in the wrong area and another boss scolded me a bit in front of my sister, and she also personally scolded me saying "you need to do something", "you're not doing anything", and then another co-worker complained about me, and my sister had to tell the co-worker that I'm new and is a family member as an excuse. Also as silly as this might sound, I passed by several mirrors, and I had a look at myself, and just had these negative implied thoughts to myself, like "look at you, you're such a failure", "you look so hate-able".

Overall, I just felt so useless, and my ego was constantly being bashed, even though these were just small criticism and I am new, so it's expected, but still, I suddenly felt like everybody in the workplace just hated me, out to get me, etc. What made it worse is my sister had high hopes for me, since everything went very smooth prior to today, I just felt like I led her down. By myself, I was confident and doing pretty good with the training, and didn't get into any conflicts at all, she always asked me how was work, and my answer was always that it was smooth and everything was good, after today, it all just changed, my mood and feeling towards the workplace went from something I really am looking forward to doing, to now wanting to quit and avoid having to deal with issues and disappointing co-workers and customers, and I can also definitely sense some negative feelings coming from my sister after today.
