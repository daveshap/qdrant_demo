Move on or wait it out?
So I've been job hunting for almost a year now. I have gotten an interview at a nice geochem company (my specific area of study) and they offered me the job. At the same time I interviewed for another geochem company that offered slightly less pay but better benefits and they also offered me the job. I took the second job 2 weeks ago and turned down the first offer.

Today I emailed them to see when we can talk start date, and I got this "I talked to (manager) yesterday, they are completely booked with guys for (my specific position) unfortunately. He doesn’t know when it will open up so I can’t give you a timeline for when they can get you started. They have openings for compliance positions and I tried pushing to get you in there but he doesn’t think you would be a good fit on that side. As of right now I don’t have any other positions open that you would qualify for so it’s kind of a waiting game now unless you were to find something else on your own. I apologize for the inconvenience."

So do I just move on or wait it out? Kind of upset and angry that they would offer me the job and then say they dont have an open position at this time.

Thanks in advance!
