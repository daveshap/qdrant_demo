ERIN: Where's my paycheck?
JANE: Have you been logging on?
ERIN: What?
JANE: I moved payroll onto the computer. It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
ERIN: Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
JANE: You're clever. I'm sure you'll think of something.
