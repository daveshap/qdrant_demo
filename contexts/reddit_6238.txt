salary negotiation if it is slightly above industry standard?
I’m a recent college grad and got my first offer letter! I’m super excited to work and leave unemployment behind me but of course everyone is telling me to negotiate which is stressing me out hella aha. I’m just curious on some of your thoughts! 

This job listing had the salary range provided and i was offered the highest of the range. The amount is about $1000+ the industry median for my area.
I don’t plan on asking for anything too drastic, like a $1.5k (~11%) increase, this is an hourly rate position. I know many companies expect you to negotiate, but is it the right decision to with given these circumstances? Sorry it’s so vague, the inner paranoid in me is worried my employer might figure out it’s me or something hahah

Many many thanks :)

Edit/update: my friend told me to check out Glassdoor’s know your worth calculator. 
in my areas market value, I am on the lower end of the salary according to Glassdoor. 7k less than the median. So this is a different comparison from the one listed above.
