I need to find balance in life
All my life I have been a good straight A student who never gets into trouble at school. I am currently in highschool and have a great passion for sports. This highschool I attend is much more prestigious than my elementary and middle school. I am currently in all honors and AP classes. They are getting to be extremely difficult and although I am not failing anything my grades are dropping from As to Bs. I know this may not sound bad to most people but my parents are extremely strict on this subject. They are blaming it on sports and are threatening to make me quit. I am working extremely hard to go to tutoring before practice after school but despite my best efforts my grades keep dropping. I don't know what to do anymore. I am constantly up till midnight or later with my work because I just don't understand it but my parents can't see that. They only see how ever since I joined a sport team my grades are dropping because I spend too much time with sports. 


Should I quit my sport ? How can I get my parents to see that I need balance in my life ? Although my grades are very important to me and always have been, how do I find the correct amount of time to spend with friends and to spend with academics?
