SAM: Did you call that radio station again?
JONAH: No.
SAM: Everyone at work heard you.
JONAH: I just called for a second.
SAM: Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
JONAH: It's a short word.
SAM: This is not a joke. Thank God Victoria doesn't know. It would really have hurt her feelings.
JONAH: If she knew, she'd never forgive me. It would be hopeless for the two of you.
