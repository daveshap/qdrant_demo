My anxiety comes in waves of good weeks and bad weeks. I keep a diary and on a good week I wrote out a list of bullet points for me to read when I'm having a bad week
This is just something I wrote for myself and I was just wondering if it might help any of you even a bit, idk... It's not anything official so please don't get really angry at me if I have made a mistake.

-	Panic attacks / anxiety means cortisol levels are high
-	It's next to impossible to think happy thoughts when there’s cortisol everywhere
-	It's just the chemical making you feel this way, this is not you
-	If you start feeling anxious, just try to lower the cortisol levels; breath, ground yourself, feet on the floor, mindfulness
-	These are just thoughts, they aren’t as bad as they seem – it doesn’t seem true right now but you must believe it
-	Be aware and let them happen, don’t fight it
-	You can get through this, you have before
-	Just ride it out
-	Resist the temptation to let the anxiety take over – you do not want to feel this way
-	If you just want an excuse to relax/procrastinate you can do that without anxiety
-	If you refuse to believe that when you’re happy you’re not just faking it, then at least accept that it's nicer like that anyway as you dont have frequent panic attacks
-	Fuck the cortisol
-	Fuck anxiety
-	This won’t last forever

Edit: thank you for all the lovely comments
