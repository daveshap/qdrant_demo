What policies allow the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader to refuse to vote on important issues? What are the benefits and drawbacks of making it substantially easier for Congressmen to force an bill to go to a vote?
The current government shutdown is continuing despite the fact that the Senate has already voted on a budget with [near unanimous approval](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/10/18176932/senate-democrats-mitch-mcconnell-government-shutdown). The House has [introduced a similar bill](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shutdown-vote/house-passes-bill-that-would-end-shutdown-but-senate-unlikely-to-take-up-idUSKCN1P32LG) that would likely pass a vote in both houses of Congress, yet the shutdown continues because [the Senate Majority Leader has refused to hold a vote](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-could-drag-on-senate-gop-sticks-with-trump-on-wall.html). 

This is far from the first time this has happened in the last few years. Congressional leaders have continuously blocked popular bipartisan initiatives that would likely pass by wide margins, such as [the bill to protect the Special Counsel Investigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/senators-to-seek-vote-on-bill-that-would-protect-mueller-1542199892), and [John Boehner with immigration reform](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/11/06/boehner-refuses-to-act-on-immigration-reform/?utm_term=.30530ef1f020).
