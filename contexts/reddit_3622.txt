Just a reminder for those trying to navigate the world of dating
I don’t know who needs to see this but yeah...

If someone wants to be with you, they’ll be with you. No questions, no ifs, buts or maybes. People will make it work if they want to make it work. 

Don’t let anyone treat you as an option. 

You’re so much better than that.



Edit: as a simple post to remind myself if anyone else, i just wanted to say hearing all the stories and echoes of similar strains within the dating world, i feel way more hopeful and fired up than i have in the past few months. 

We’re all worth it. I truly believe that and you should too. 

I hope this reminder helps you do whatever it is you need to do and be the best version of you that you can be, with or without your crush.
