FERGUS: She'd be anyone's type.
JODY: Don't you think of it, fucker.
FERGUS: Why not?
JODY: She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
FERGUS: No?
JODY: Absolutely not.
FERGUS: She your wife?
JODY: Suppose you could say that.
FERGUS: You make a nice couple.
JODY: Don't I know it.
FERGUS: So what were you fucking around for, then?
JODY: You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
FERGUS: She's a friend of mine
JODY: Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
FERGUS: What?
JODY: What the fuck am I doing here.
FERGUS: What the fuck were you doing here?
JODY: I got sent.
FERGUS: You could have said no.
JODY: Can't. Once I signed up.
FERGUS: Why did you sign up?
JODY: It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
FERGUS: Shouldn't take it personally.
JODY: Go back to your banana tree
FERGUS: And you play cricket?.
JODY: Best game in the world.
FERGUS: Ever see hurling?
JODY: That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
FERGUS: Best game in the world.
JODY: Never.
FERGUS: The fastest.
JODY: Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
FERGUS: How different?
JODY: Toffs' game there. But not at home. .
JODY: So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
FERGUS: I'll bear that in mind.
