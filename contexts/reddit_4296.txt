Corona Virus made us rush this. Best decision ever made.
My partner (25M) and myself (23M) have only been together 5 months next week.. I moved in with him at the start of our countries lock down, I only meant to stay while I was furloughed from my old job. On a whim I applied for a job closer to his house. I got it. I didn't expect to. But I did. I gave up my flat, my old job and my old town. We decided to try and see if it works. If it didn't work now, why would it work a year later? 

I've been living here two months now. There's still the odd thing to unpack but this house feels more like home than any of my old flats that I've lived alone in. 

We're more in love now than ever, and I fall in love with him more and more everyday. We're planning our future in this house, kids, pets and DIY projects. We have the occasional spat but never anything serious. 


I made the right decision and I couldn't be happier.
