If someone tells me to "just calm down" one more time I swear to god .
Anyone else have this problem people just say "just calm down"  or " I have anxiety too it's not that hard "    like bitch if you had anxiety you would know you dont just "calm down" .  

I'm cross posting this to the other anxiety sub too
