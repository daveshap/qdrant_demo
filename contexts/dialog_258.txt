LUTHER: A cop...
CATES: I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
LUTHER: Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
CATES: You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
LUTHER: Who gives a fuck what you think?
CATES: Hey, this works pretty good.
HAMMOND: Thank you.
CATES: Want to try it again?
LUTHER: Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
CATES: I think I met her. Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
LUTHER: I don't know.
