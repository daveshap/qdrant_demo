Money vs sex?
I have a question which I hope it won't offend anyone. I'm honestly wondering if people think and feel the same.

Girls get offended by guys who sexualize them and who talk to them about how sexy they are and speak about their bodies and what they want to do to them, etc... Especially at an early stage.

I met once a very beautiful lady online and among first questions she asked me is, whether I'm renting or owning a house, which was totally random and off topic. Also others ask whether I have a car or not and similar questions.

I want to hear from both guys and girls, isn't this offensive as well? Trying to figure out how much am I worth from first day? Or is it just me?
