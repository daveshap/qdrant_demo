Startup receives funding in couple of months after struggling for a long time. What are the things I should take care as an employee before it happens?
I joined the startup a year ago, was paid the promised amount of money for first three months.  Things fell apart from then, the company ran out of money and then I was paid the travel allowance and sometimes was paid nothing, many co-workers left. I and few others decided to stick around as I was doing something I enjoyed. The co-founders were upfront about the whole situation and seeing their confidence I stuck around even more than I was comfortable with. 
There were no legal binding contracts when I joined, "we shook on it". But things are about to change when the funding scene happens. What are the documents legal or otherwise I should take care of? Anything else that I should take care? This is my first legitimate gig, will like guidance as much as possible.

P.S. first time poster, forgive me if I didn't follow any rules. Thanks
