Online job hunting - what’s up with all the forms?
I’m job hunting for the first time in over 10 years. 

Why does every company have such a LENGTHY online application process?!?! I don’t mind a short questionnaire, but I’m really tired of rewriting all of the exact same work history, skills, and contact info that are ALREADY RIGHT THERE ON MY CV. 

Maybe I need to do more networking so I can just send my CV straight to the right person. 

Any other job hunting tips are appreciated!
