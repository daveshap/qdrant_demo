ETSI EN 300 220-1 General performance criteria In Chapter \"general performance criteria\" the standard states that these criteria, for receiver performance tests, are equivlent:after demodulation, a data signal with a bit error ratio of 1% without correctionafter demodulation, a message acceptance ratio of 80%My questions are:What is a message and is it equivalent to a packet?If not, how does it relate to a packet?I am asking this because there is a formula which converts BER to PER and I would like to know if I can use it but just exchange message with packet.
