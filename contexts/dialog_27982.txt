THELMA: I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
LOUISE: He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy. He knows how to chase and that's it. Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do. So he runs away.
THELMA: I heard that.
