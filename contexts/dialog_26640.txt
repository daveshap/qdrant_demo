SCHWARTZ: There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
MITCHELL: I object to that form of question. Note that.
NICOLE: No.
SCHWARTZ: Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
NICOLE: Yes.
SCHWARTZ: You remember that much?
NICOLE: As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
MITCHELL: Note my objection. She said, 'As I'm talking.'
SCHWARTZ: Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
NICOLE: Yes.
NICOLE: There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods. And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual. I remember that. I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
SCHWARTZ: You are?
NICOLE: Yes.
MITCHELL: Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
SCHWARTZ: And what was the weather like at this time?
NICOLE: It was snowing.
MITCHELL: Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
SCHWARTZ: I will offer that report. Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else you observed at that time?
NICOLE: Before the actual accident?
SCHWARTZ: Yes.
NICOLE: I was scared.
SCHWARTZ: Why were you scared?
SCHWARTZ: This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
NICOLE: Yes, I understand.
SCHWARTZ: Why were you scared?
NICOLE: Dolores was driving too fast.
SCHWARTZ: Mrs. Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
NICOLE: The speedometer. And it was downhill there.
SCHWARTZ: You could see the speedometer?
NICOLE: Yes. I looked. I remember clearly now. It seemed we were going too fast down the hill. I was scared.
SCHWARTZ: How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going? To the best of your recollection?
NICOLE: Seventy-two miles an hour.
SCHWARTZ: Seventy-two miles an hour? You're sure of this?
NICOLE: Positive.
SCHWARTZ: You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
NICOLE: I told you I was positive. The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
SCHWARTZ: You saw the speedometer?
NICOLE: Yes.
SCHWARTZ: Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
NICOLE: No.
SCHWARTZ: Why not?
NICOLE: I was scared. And there wasn't time.
SCHWARTZ: There wasn't time?
NICOLE: No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed.
SCHWARTZ: You remember this?
NICOLE: Yes. I do now. Now that I'm telling it.
