REGGIE: What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
BARTHOLOMEW: Were you followed?
REGGIE: Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
BARTHOLOMEW: Agents.
REGGIE: He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
BARTHOLOMEW: Who?
REGGIE: Dyle, or whatever his name is.
BARTHOLOMEW: What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
REGGIE: He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
BARTHOLOMEW: Describe him.
REGGIE: Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
BARTHOLOMEW: No.
REGGIE: No, what?
BARTHOLOMEW: That's not Carson Dyle.
REGGIE: Carson?
BARTHOLOMEW: There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
REGGIE: You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
