HARRY: Hi Vada.
VADA: Hi.
HARRY: What are you doing.
VADA: Feeding my fish.
HARRY: Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
VADA: Yes.
HARRY: He's getting big. Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
HARRY: Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
VADA: I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
VADA: Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
HARRY: No sweetheart, you can't.
VADA: Why not?
HARRY: He was allergic to bees.
VADA: He's okay isn't he?
HARRY: There were just too many of 'em.
VADA: Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
DR WELTY: Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
VADA: I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
DR WELTY: Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
VADA: It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
DR WELTY: What Hurts Vada?
VADA: The bee stings! I can't breathe!
