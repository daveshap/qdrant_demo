MARTIN: Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
LAURIE: Finish your breakfast...
MARTIN: I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
LAURIE: Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
MARTIN: But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse.
LAURIE: Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
MARTIN: I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
