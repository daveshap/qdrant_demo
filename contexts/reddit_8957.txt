What emergency powers could President Trump use to start construction of a border wall without Congressional approval and to what extent can they be challenged?
[President Trump said today that this was an option:](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/democrats-trump-meeting-government-shutdown.html)

> At the same time, in response to a question from a reporter, the president held out the possibility that he could declare a national emergency and assume the unilateral power to build a wall without congressional approval.

> “I may do it,” he said, flanked by Mr. Pence, Ms. Nielsen and congressional Republican leaders. “We could call a national emergency and build it very quickly. That’s another way to do it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, that’s better.”

How would this work? From where does the US Executive get this power and are there any checks to prevent the Executive from using emergency powers for non-emergencies?
