I was devastated after a staff meeting - how to I move on?
I started this job as an admin. I work with three people. One was hired right after me. Over the last three months, I've been told I've been doing a great job, but still have a ways to go (obviously after only being there three months). We had a staff admin meeting to discuss who was doing what and who was going to do what.

Before, the higher-lever work went to the two more senior admins (80%) with my providing assistance to them (20%) and the other person is still training. Now, the higher-level work were to be divided among my three coworkers and I am odd man out. Instead, my role is literally doing the grunt work. Instead of doing account management, I'm now responsible for grunt work like cleaning out the fridge on Friday and keeping the copier room tidy. I never felt so insulted and hurt. I have and can do more challenging work and am not sure why or how this was decided. It was a conversation I was left out of. I believe our bosses asked the senior admins for their input because they told me to be prepared to doing some grunt AND accounting work. One of the senior admin said that the new alignment would leave her overwhelmed and asked if some of it could be taken off her plate. She was quickly shut down instead of giving some of it to me. I didn't speak up because they would have shut me down too. No need to look stupid in addition to feeling upset.

I have so much more to offer and have proven it. I know I have not made as big mistakes as the senior admins did after their first three months. The head boss mentioned that if someone is screwing up all the time then you're not going to be giving this higher-level work and I couldn't tell if he was directing that comment to me. No one has said anything to me about any major and consistent mistakes on my end. Not one person. Even in the meeting they mentioned some of our shortfalls and mine were minor like missing a call as compared to my coworkers' mistakes literally costing the firm money. I was going to ask them if something happened to make them feel like that I can only do grunt work last night and I didn't because I was too upset.

I keep on telling myself that it's not like I'm going to be paid less to make coffee and won't need to stay late doing paperwork anymore. My sense is that people will start to ask why is I am being paid what I am being paid to make coffee and/or I'm too stupid/unwilling/lazy to do anything else. I will ask my boss and her boss on Monday.

EDIT: I am not young. I am actually older than my co-workers.

EDIT: Yes, there is some type of disconnect and I believe that it's because one or both of the senior admins are speaking on my behalf to our supervisors. One in particular. I started to cut that person off because I know I cannot trust her, but I was told that cutting people off at work would backfire by the other admin. The other two admins have made serious and costly mistakes when they first started and even recently (which was the reason why we had the meeting to begin with). Those mistakes were brought to their attention formally (closed door meetings with supervisors) as well as plans to prevent them from repeating those mistakes. I, on the other hand, have never had one of those "closed door" meetings. There were times when they mentioned to me casually "hey, next time you take a message from XYZ make sure you ask them for both their cell and home phone" or "next time review the bill to see if anything on it looks off." So when they're talking about people screwing up and being left out of challenging work, I cannot figure out if it's directed at me or to all of us. This troubles me because it can be inferred that they might taking the approach that I'm not worth fixing.

Finally, I've had blunt conversations with my boss and her boss. I explained to them my anxiety and they assured me that I was doing fine, I am being way too hard on myself and (repeatedly, might I add) that if someone is going to be fired, then they would know it. They stressed to me they try to fix the problem(s) and I see that with current and past employees. They've mentioned that A LOT.

TBH, I believe that people are right when they say I am not promoting myself enough. I also believe that I might have gotten blamed for things that I wasn't to blame for and am not aware of it and one of my co-workers needs to be cut off. Come Monday morning, I am going to be the first person in the office and speak to my boss and squarely ask her where do I stand and ask her how the choice/justification/logic was made to switch things up and even ask for some of the high-level work back. That is all I can do and keep my mouth shut.

EDIT: I have no intention to quit. I've had a few other jobs and this is still the best job that I've ever had. I am literally making $8 more dollars an hour, pay $0 for my benefits, close to home and the people are generally nice. It's stable, beautiful offices and I am grateful to be there. That is why it bothers me so much - because I do care about my job. I know the grass isn't going to be NOT on the other side. That is why I am willing to fight to make this work.
