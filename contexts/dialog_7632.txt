EDDIE: Who's been giving you weird looks?
DONNIE: A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason. But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
EDDIE: You're my only son...
DONNIE: I know, Dad.
EDDIE: I know I'm not the best... communicator. But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool. But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
