I have a BA in Psych and want to build hotels
I graduated this year with a BA in psychology but in my last couple years realized I want to be in the hospitality industry, specifically, I want to build my own environmentally sustainable hotel. 

I’m currently working my first job in communications for the corporate office of a big hotel company.  This position helped me enter the industry and I’ve learned a lot but I’m considering pursuing a masters degree to help me toward my goal.

I’m considering hospitality management degrees but also general business management and MBA programs. I’m looking for some advice and direction in my career path and what programs I should look into. Because I’m also very interested in sustainability, I’d like to find a program that will allow me to get a dual degree or some kind of emphasis.

aside from education are there specific jobs I should focus on in order to direct my career in the right path? ex: jobs in hotel development to open new properties or hotel management?

I’m over thinking a little but I really want to work toward actualizing this goal! Thanks in advance for all the help!
