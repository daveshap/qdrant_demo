ANDY: Gosh. Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
LYNNE: You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.

ANDY: Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
LYNNE: Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
ANDY: Yes.
LYNNE: Why Memphis?
ANDY: Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world! I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me! Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win! Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show! What do you say???
LYNNE: And all this will be for real?
ANDY: If you want...
