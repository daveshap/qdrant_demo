How was this character killed in Babylon 5 season 3 finale? On Season 3 finale...<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   Sheridan refuses to join the Shadows and after fighting them off-camera, they finally corner him on a balcony over an abyss. He is wounded but able to walk, step on the edge of the balcony and jump into the abyss, while his White Star \u2014armed with two nuclear bombs\u2014 crashes into (or nearby) the same place he is jumping from. At some point Sheridan dies, or at least that's what Lorien tells him.</blockquote>But how did this happen...?Was he so badly wounded in the fight?Was it because the blast/radiation of the explosion?Was he wounded when he was caught?Or \u2014the least likely\u2014 did he hit bottom? (which implies an instant death and the complete reconstruction/regeneration of his probably badly broken body, a thing Lorien is not supposed to be capable to do, because, as he says:<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">    \"I cannot create life, but I can breathe on the remaining embers...\")</blockquote>Is there any canon source/JMS commentary that explains the reason for this particular demise?
