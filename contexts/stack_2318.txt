Can't give unusual gem to appraiser Every time I try to bring an unusual gem to an appraiser they say \"Wanna talk? finish those jobs for Brynjolf first\" but I don't know what I have to do for Brynjolf cause I have so many quests to do. Anyone know what quest it is? Is there anything else I have to do to bring an unusual gem to an appraiser? I can't get rid of the unusual gem.
