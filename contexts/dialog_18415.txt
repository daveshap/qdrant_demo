TAYLOR: Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
JEFFERSON: Like what, Mr. Taylor?
TAYLOR: Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
JEFFERSON: Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
TAYLOR: But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
JEFFERSON: What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
TAYLOR: Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.
PAINE: Jim!
TAYLOR: Just a minute, Joe!
PAINE: You can't say *that* to--
TAYLOR: *I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
