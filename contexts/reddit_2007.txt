The word "University" contains the letters R, T, N, I, and E.
This means that any university that contains the letters O and F in its logo can be changed to "Fortnite University" or "The University of Fortnite" in MS Paint. This applies to a lot of universities since so many of them contain the word "of", and it also applies to any Institute of Technology with an R in its name.

Some examples:
