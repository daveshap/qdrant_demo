VALIANT: Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
ROGER RABBIT: Don't do that! I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me. They were waitin' for me when I got home last night. I ran.
VALIANT: If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
ROGER RABBIT: Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit. We always run.
