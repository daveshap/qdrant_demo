If this gets more than 2 upvotes I’ll send a letter to Georgia Tech rejecting my rejection letter
edit: alright bet y’all I’m doing this tomorrow

edit 2: alright people I don’t know how to post proof so I’m just typing what I said lol the email was sent at 8:22 pm EST to the Georgia Tech Office of Admissions email address. Thank you guys for the inspiration :) the letter reads as follows:

Dear Sir/Madam,

Thank you for your letter regarding my admission decision. Unfortunately after reviewing the letter I regret to inform you that I will not be able to offer you a spot on my list of rejections this year. I wish a different decision had been possible but I hope this knowledge will be beneficial to your plans for the future. Through this excruciating process, I worked hard to holistically review the credentials of each college. While I wish it were possible to offer this coveted position to every college, I’m faced with the necessity of choosing only a select few. I offer my sincerest apologies for informing you of this.

I appreciate your continued interest of me as a student and wish you the best success in your future endeavors

Warmly,
me :)
