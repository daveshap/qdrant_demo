ValueError: Requesting 3-fold cross-validation but provided less than 3 examples for at least one class. Any way to get away with this? I am trying to perform multiclass classification on a 10 class dataset with around 650 data points. But whenever trying to run the code, it gives the above-mentioned error. Although, I understand what does it mean but is there any way to get away with this?
