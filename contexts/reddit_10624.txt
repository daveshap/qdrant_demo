I don’t want to kill myself. I want to delete my save file and start over.
Dying seems pointless. It feels like demoing a building because the pipes are bad. But god, if I thought it would send me back, Russian-Doll style, I’d do it in a heartbeat.

I want to be 13-14 again, and be as loud and persistent as possible about the fact that I was suicidally depressed, even then, and about the abuse I and my family suffered at home.

I want to smack that first beer I chugged at that party out of my hand. I missed the little note at the bottom of the screen saying “this will affect your destiny”. I want to have never started down this path that’s taken so much.

I want to tell the “friends” I had growing up that I am not their whipping boy, then find people who would actually make me feel good about myself.

I want to demand therapy and medication, and take it seriously from the start.

I want to actually have the wherewithal and energy to take college apps seriously, and end up somewhere I wanted to be, not within spitting distance of my family.

Most of all, I want to avoid isolating myself for so goddamn long. I want to avoid becoming a 25 year old who has tons of “friends” but can’t remember the last time he touched a human being.

I realize my mistakes now. I could undo them if I could only have the chance.
