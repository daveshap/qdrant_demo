Can Netsparker detect a CVE in an open source library packaged in a WebPack bundle? In a recent Netsparker scan, a CVE against an open source JavaScript library was reported (as expected). I'm trying to understand exactly how Netsparker determines:  1. Which JS library is being used, and 2. Which version of the JS library is being usedMy guess is that it is parsing the version info from the comments in the header. However, if a JS library is combined with others using WebPack to create a bundle, can Netsparker determine that multiple libraries are being used and detect CVEs for all of them?I looked on the Netsparker site, but couldn't find enough information. I'm asking this because I don't have a copy of Netsparker that I can arbitrarily run.
