PSA: I've seen this common catchphrase a lot "You need to trust your partner" and it needs addressing. You should trust but you should also verify!
A lot of folks seem to have this reinforced belief that you should maintain a constant level of trust for your partner even if they are acting in ways that don't elicit trust within the relationship. Trusting blindly is the worst thing that someone can do and when folk say "you need to trust them" they are effectively saying "you need to trust them even if your concerns are justified and if they break your trust, so be it". STOP giving this crap advice to people in relationships. It leads them into believing that they should not be worried and that what is causing them to be concerned will just fix itself. Reality doesn't work that way. In any relationship, not just marital ones, it may very well take the actions of one party to save the other party from themselves and from external threats, so that the relationship itself can be preserved. 

Tl;Dr the advice "you need to trust your partner" is common word salad that isn't helping relationships. People in relationships should trust but they should also verify. Take action and don't expect things to just work themselves out.
