Can you have interaction terms for both \"sides\" of a dummy variable in a single regression? I'm really not sure how to phrase my question properly, so I apologize if this has been answered elsewhere. Let's say I'm interested in using a regression to predict wage using sex and an interaction term (height), where the sex variable is 0 if a person is female.wage = sex+ sex* height + constant + errorMy understanding is that the omitted category here is a female person. What if I also wanted to investigate the effect of weight on being female as it impacts wage? Could I have a \"reverse\" sex term that is 1 if the person is female? Would something like this be valid:  wage = sex+ sex* height + reverse_sex * weight + constant + errorWould the omitted category still be a female person? Can I capture both interaction effects in one regression? Thanks in advance for the help!
