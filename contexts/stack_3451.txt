Domain SSL encryption from client to DNS Server Im wondering why the domain name is not encrypted when a request do a DNS Server is made. As it seems this is the main weaknesses for internet users.I came to this when i heard that in germany vodafone has blocked kinox.to from their customers.The Question which came up is how can they determine which site you are trying to access if everything is encrypted?And could we solve the USA net neutrality problem with just encrypting the domain name?
