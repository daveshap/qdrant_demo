CHARLEY: Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.

CHARLEY: I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.
TERRY: Wow... .
CHARLEY: What do you weigh these days, slugger?
TERRY: ...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
CHARLEY: Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
TERRY: It wasn't him! It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, Kid
CHARLEY: I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
TERRY: See! You don't understand!
CHARLEY: I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
TERRY: You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.
TERRY: It was you, Charley... .
CHARLEY: Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
