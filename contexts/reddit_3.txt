[MODPOST] [META] Lets bring this subreddit back from the dead. ~ please upvote. self post, no karma. 
Hey everyone! I'm one of your friendly neighborhood mods. I've always had faith in this subreddit, and although I was de-modded for a while, I always hoped it would turn into something. Unfortunately, it is still in the same, cold, dead state it has been in since I left. So, I will try my hardest to make this subreddit a good branch off of /r/teenagers, where you can give and receive advice. To start this off, I want everyone who reads this to (please) comment with a picture of yourself and a little bit about yourself. What you like to do in your spare time, what music you're into, different hobbies or habits or traits you have that make you different, etc. Anything that comes to mind. Also, try to think of one thing in your life you'd like to improve. I look forward to seeing all your posts (here's to hoping there will be any!), and I will start this off with a bit about myself. 

This is me: http://i.imgur.com/9rUBX.jpg , http://i.imgur.com/J5s74.jpg

I'm a programmer, aspiring bodybuilder, gamer, singer/songwriter and rapper. The only thing I wish to improve, is that I stop procrastinating. That shit is annoying. Okay, your turns!

EDIT: Here's another picture of me trying to look like James Bond because I just got a new suit. :) - http://i.imgur.com/2lSwJ.jpg
