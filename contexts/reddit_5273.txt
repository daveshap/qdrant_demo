Is it me or my targets that are insane?
I’ve just got a new job doing customer service for a company in the UK energy industry. They’re telling me they expect me to send a minimum of 11 emails an hour. That’s just under an email every 5 minutes, not allowing for breaks. I’m currently at between 6-9 an hour and just don’t see anyway of getting to that target. I’m guessing I could not be cut out for this... but is this normal?
