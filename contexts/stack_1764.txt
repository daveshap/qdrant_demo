Prevent oscilloscope scrolling BackgroundI already have a (2nd hand) Philips PM 3253 oscilloscope. Although it has many features and is fast (50 MHz) the display is so bad, it's barely usable.Therefore I bought another (2nd hand) oscilloscope, a Philips PM 3110 (2 channel, 10 MHz) with far less features). The display is much better.QuestionHowever, when I for example show a square wave on the oscilloscope, it is scrolling very fast, I have about 2 waves per square (cm). I tried moving the X position knob, but that only makes the left or right side being clipped/invisible. And changing the X Magn. knob changes the scrolling, but in no way I can keep it more or less steady. I tried moving along the entire X Magn range and tried different Time Div. knob values.What am I doing wrong? I see sometimes pictures of e.g. sinus or square waves which are not moving \u2026 or is that because a (very fast) picture is made?
