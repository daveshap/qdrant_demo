SHELLY: What's this? December 8th, 1958?
VADA: I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
SHELLY: Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
VADA: This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
SHELLY: Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
VADA: Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
SHELLY: No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
VADA: Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
SHELLY: Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
VADA: I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
SHELLY: Well you've gotta be prepared.
VADA: I'm definitely traveling some day.
SHELLY: Why not now?
VADA: What do you mean?
SHELLY: How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
VADA: But what about you and the baby? You need me.
SHELLY: Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
VADA: Yeah, it would be kinda great.
SHELLY: It would be fantastic.
VADA: But Dad'll never go for it.
SHELLY: You leave your father to me.
