Not a “cultural fit” for a job?
Hey y’all.

Recently been interviewing for various jobs and have put a lot of time and effort into it.

I’ve had many rejections, but this rejection stung the most. I put so much thought, time, care, and initiative into this company and thought I’d at least have a decent chance at the position.

I was rejected, which is okay with me, but as long as I can receive some feedback and continue to improve. 

However, I was told that there was nothing I could improve on for the future, it’s just that I was not a “cultural fit.” Like what?

I’m trying to wrap my head around what this means. I thought I connected well with the interviewer. No awkward pauses, no “wrong” answers, and there were no questions during the actual interview that seemed to involve “culture”. 

That being said, this job was very competitive, so maybe I simply was good but just not good enough. Maybe they had their eye on someone else already.

What I’m interested in : what does “cultural fit” mean within a company and how can managers try to find a good fit during an interview?

Thanks!

**TL;DR** a bit sad because a job rejected me for no reason other than being “not a cultural fit.” Looking for some explanation and insight
