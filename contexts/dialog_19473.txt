PREACHER: Ben, I'm a Man of God.
BEN HARPER: Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
PREACHER: No, Ben.
BEN HARPER: What'd I say? What? What? What? What?
PREACHER: You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, And a little child shall lead them.""
BEN HARPER: Hm!
PREACHER: You killed two men, Ben Harper.
BEN HARPER: That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
PREACHER: With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
BEN HARPER: Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
PREACHER: Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
BEN HARPER: How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
PREACHER: I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
BEN HARPER: You, Preacher?
PREACHER: That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
BEN HARPER: What religion do you profess, Preacher?
PREACHER: The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
BEN HARPER: I'll bet.
PREACHER: Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
BEN HARPER: Keep talkin', Preacher.
PREACHER: If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
BEN HARPER: Keep talkin', Preacher.
