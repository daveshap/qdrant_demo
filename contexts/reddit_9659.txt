Timeline for Admissions
Hi All! I applied for a program that I am really really hoping to get into a few months ago. The applications closed today so I assume they will begin reviewing them soon. The program only accepts 15 students per year so I am very unsure of whether I will be accepted. Is there a general timeline that these programs typically follow for making their admissions decisions? In general, when is the earliest and latest they might let me know?
