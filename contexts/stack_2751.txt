Investigating 2D Oscillating motion I once did an experiment into Simple Harmonic motion of a mass oscillating in 1D on a spring. I wanted to extend this into two dimensions. I can see how varying the starting offset and also ratio of spring constants would vary my results. However, I don't know how I would accurately set it up, and also therefore what suitable apparatus would be. Any ideas of equipment to MEASURE and to USE.Crucially, I wanted to give a starting push to the mass in a direction, with it already being offset, for example to create a circle, byt getting x=cos(t) and y = sin(t). How would i do this in an accurate way that i could measure?
