Never opening my mouth ever again
Any time I talk about myself or how I feel to people or reach out for help I always end up messing up and ruining their day or making them annoyed or angry or just disappointed. 

No more, I’ll finally accept the approach where I pretend everything is perfectly great and nothing is wrong because keeping to myself is strides better than ruining someone else’s mood, they don’t deserve to deal with my bullshit and I don’t deserve anyone’s help and kindness
