Ubuntu 18.04.1 won't install on Dell Precision M6500 I have a Dell Precision M6500, it runs 16.04 (64-bit) just fine. Hard drive is 500GB8GB RAMIntel Core i5 M560 CPUHyperthreading enabledSpeedStep enabledTPM disabledXD support disabledI swapped hard drives to a known good 320GB drive and tried to install 18.04 - no joy.  It will get to a desktop running on the live DVD, I click on the installation icon, nothing happens.  Tried a second, known good blank 320GB hard drive, same results.  BIOS is current at A10.  Hard drives are physical disks, not SSDs.  Hard drive type in BIOS is AHCI.  I changed no values in BIOS when swapping hard drives. I put the 16.04 hard drive back in the machine, it boots and runs fine.18.04 Installation DVD has been used to install on other computers without problems and does not appear to be damaged.  I tried an Ubuntu Budgie 18.04 DVD, exact same results.  On a whim, while writing this question, I decided to try a third hard drive, this time a 250GB drive.  Same results, will not launch the installation.I would appreciate any help and advice you can offer. I've used Ubuntu since 10.04 and this is the first time I've had a problem installing the OS that I could not solve.
