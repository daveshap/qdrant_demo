Dating For People Over 25+
I miss having substantial feelings for someone, instead of thinking "this person is good for me, I should see where it takes me," before I date them. I know that sounds bad, but I feel like I haven't had a "fuck yes I want to date you" situation in a long time.

Is it just me, but I miss the feeling of having a crush on someone and it feels like it's been forever since I've felt that. I'm 27 and before all this Covid stuff, my group of friends would always go out with each other to clubs/bars, but we would never meet anyone new. I know that it's one of the issues, but are other late 20's experiencing this?

When I bring this up to people, they always say "you gotta find someone on a dating app," but I really don't want to meet my SO on one of these apps. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with that and I have many friends who have met wonderful people from dating apps. I just want that "crush" feeling before I get into something serious and I feel that apps don't do that for me? I am on all of the apps, but I just feel like it's so superficial!

Does anyone else feel like this? I know that Covid is making things WAY worse...I'm just worried because I'm catching myself saying "They would be good for me, maybe I should try it out," instead of saying "I have a crush on this person and I want to see if they have mutual feelings."

Maybe it's me just missing stupid teenage romance, but I used to feel this way with my past relationships.
