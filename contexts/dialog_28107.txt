DEBORAH: How dare you... You don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
LOMBARD: The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
DEBORAH: No. The question now is how long it’s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
LOMBARD: Excuse me?
DEBORAH: Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
LOMBARD: Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
DEBORAH: No. You’re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
DEBORAH: Laurence!
LOMBARD: I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
DEBORAH: The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
LOMBARD: Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
DEBORAH: Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
LOMBARD: Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
