SURAN: Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
SHINZON: You don't have to understand.
SURAN: And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
SHINZON: I have a purpose.
SURAN: Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
SHINZON: Silence, Romulan!
SHINZON: You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guardâ€™s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
SURAN: Praetor.
SHINZON: Now go. I have some personal business.
