MIMI: and there she was lying dead. The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
JORGENSEN: I thought you said you weren't going there.
MIMI: Why, you said...
JORGENSEN: Never mind.
GILBERT: Did they find any clues... a gun or fingerprints or anything?
MIMI: Not a thing.
GILBERT: Was there much blood?
DOROTHY: Don't. It's horrible.
MIMI: Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
GILBERT: Did you kill her?
MIMI: Gilbert!
GILBERT: Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
MIMI: I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
