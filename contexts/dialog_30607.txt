BUD: Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
NATALIE: What are you doing here?
BUD: ...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
NATALIE: First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
BUD: It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
NATALIE: Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
