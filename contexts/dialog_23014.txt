SCHINDLER: I go to work the other day, there's nobody there. Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -
GOETH: They're not gone, they're here.
SCHINDLER: They're mine!
SCHINDLER: Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
GOETH: We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
SCHINDLER: It's bad business.
GOETH: Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do? You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done. Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example. But that's good business.
GOETH: Scherner told me something else about you.
SCHINDLER: Yeah, what's that?
GOETH: That you know the meaning of the word gratitude. That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
SCHINDLER: True.
