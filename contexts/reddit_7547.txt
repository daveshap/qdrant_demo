Looking for advice for forming committee for qualifying exam later this year
Hello all,

I am in my second semester of graduate school (PhD program - electrical engineering). We are required to take the qualifying exam within 12 months of entering the program. I’m looking at roughly a late July of early August time frame to complete it.

We are required to form a committee of 3 professors from our field, none of whom can be our major advisor. My question is, as someone who is still pretty new to the area and university, how can I start forming relationships with professors prior to asking them to serve on a committee? 

One obvious alley that presents itself to me is to meet with them to talk about their research. But I’m not sure how to continue the relationship beyond that meeting as I have limited exposure to people on campus (I work/do research for my advisor most of the time at a lab off campus)?

Any suggestions will be helpful!
