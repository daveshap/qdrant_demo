SELINA: You designed Gotham Plaza? The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
BROCK: What did you think?
SELINA: Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
BROCK: Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
SELINA: I checked out your stuff at the library. Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
BROCK: You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
BROCK: I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
SELINA: Stop. We are not having a duality" conversation. "Ooh
BROCK: So, did you see Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh."
SELINA: I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten. When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
BROCK: What little boy doesn't... My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
SELINA: No it's not.
SELINA: A whip? Now that's going too far! Some of these women have no shame!
BROCK: What's the matter? What are you saying?
SELINA: Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
BROCK: This is insane. Let the heroes handle it. I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
SELINA: Your warehouse? Go on ahead--to your warehouse." I'll be okay..."
BROCK: Are you sure?
SELINA: I'm sure.
