TENZIN GYATSO: No.
TIBETAN WOMAN: Too young?
TENZIN GYATSO: Much too young.
TIBETAN WOMAN: Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
TENZIN GYATSO: Like my mother.
TIBETAN WOMAN: I see that.
TENZIN GYATSO: This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
NOBLE BOY: Does he have the spot?
TENZIN GYATSO: He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
NOBLE BOY: Is that a true story, or pretend?
TENZIN GYATSO: What do you think?
NOBLE BOY: True.
TENZIN GYATSO: You decide.
NOBLE BOY: What does the butter spot feel like?
TENZIN GYATSO: Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
