MOTHER: Yes?
BILLY: Is Rose here?
MOTHER: She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
BILLY: Well, I got to see her.
MOTHER: She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
BILLY: Where is she?
MOTHER: I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
MOTHER: That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
DADDY: Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
