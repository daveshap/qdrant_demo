Does anyone else feel like their friends and family secretly hate them and so you are terrified to talk to them and make things worse but you’re probably just being paranoid?
Just me? I feel like all of my friends actually don’t like me and “put up with me,” or that every good relationship I’ve ever had I’ve ruined—even though when I’m being rational I don’t see anything terribly wrong that I’ve done. I just feel so much anxiety around them, as if my every move could ruin another friendship. Or I get so anxious that I disappear from the friendship entirely and that’s why they don’t like me anymore, because I abandoned them. It eats up at me. I’m so afraid to hang out with my friends because I’m afraid they will think badly of me, but then our friendship drifts apart.
