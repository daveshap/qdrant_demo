PORTHOS: Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille
ATHOS: He lures us to capture.
ARAMIS: He seeks redemption.
ATHOS: You're a fool!
ARAMIS: Perhaps. But of d'Artagnan I am certain. What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
ATHOS: So what has changed?
ARAMIS: Perhaps he serves a different king.
PORTHOS: What choice is there? If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
ATHOS: You are right. But it is a trap.
PORTHOS: So what? I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
ARAMIS: Then to the Bastille.
ATHOS: To the Bastille. And death.
