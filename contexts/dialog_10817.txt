DANA: I'm sorry. Were you on your way out?
VENKMAN: No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in. Are we having a pajama party?
DANA: Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
VENKMAN: You know, if anyone else told me that, I'd have serious doubts. But coming from you, I can't honestly say I'm surprised.
DANA: I must be losing my mind. At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
VENKMAN: Who could blame him? Were you wearing this nightgown?
DANA: I don't know what to do anymore.
VENKMAN: I'll get Ray and Egon to check out the bathtub. You better stay here.
