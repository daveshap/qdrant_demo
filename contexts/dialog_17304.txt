CYPHER: Whoa! Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
NEO: Sorry.
CYPHER: No, it's all right.
NEO: What are you doing?
CYPHER: Midnight watch.
NEO: Is that...?
CYPHER: The Matrix? Yeah.
NEO: Do you always look at it encoded?
CYPHER: Have to. The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix. You get used to it, though. Your brain does the translating. I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead. You want a drink?
