NEWSMAN: How did you know your son was involved?
PAULINE: It was on the TV.
NEWSMAN: When was the last time you saw Sal?
PAULINE: Oh, a long time. Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be? He wasn't around here. I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
NEWSMAN: Did you know he was a homosexual?
PAULINE: No, not until after they killed him.
NEWSMAN: Did you always call him Junior.
PAULINE: Yeah.
NEWSMAN: Do you remember anything else about Sal?
PAULINE: No, that's all.
