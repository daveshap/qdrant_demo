My grandpa bet $500 that I’ll get into Stanford
I am an international student and my parents/grandparents think getting into a top college in the US is a walk in the park. My grandpa is so confident that I’ll get into Stanford that he said he’d pay me $500 if I don’t, but I have to pay him the same amount if I do get in.

I’m going shopping on April 2nd XD
