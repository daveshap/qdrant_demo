HENRY: You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
INDY: That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
HENRY: Well, I'm as human as the next man.
INDY: I was the next man.
HENRY: Ships that pass in the night...
INDY: Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
HENRY: Hmmm... What did we talk about?
INDY: We didn't talk. We never talked.
HENRY: And do I detect a rebuke?
INDY: A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
HENRY: Actually, I was a wonderful father.
INDY: When?
HENRY: Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
INDY: What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
HENRY: You left just when you were becoming interesting.
INDY: Dad, how can you?
HENRY: Very well. I'm here now.
