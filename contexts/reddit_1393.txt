DAE ever feel like you are rushing through the day to get home to do nothing?
I feel like from the moment I wake up until I get home I am rushing through the day and my tasks. It ends up causing me to have more anxiety because I become forgetfull or I half-ass my work duties and end up regretting it. I know if I take a deep breath and just slow down things are much more stress free, but I really want to get to the point where that is my normal. I have a job, i'm done with college, what am I rushing for...? end rant.
