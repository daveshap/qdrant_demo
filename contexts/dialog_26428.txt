LEX: Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
EVE: Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
LEX: Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
EVE: Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
LUTHOR: What else is ballast for?
LUTHOR: How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
EVE: There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
LUTHOR: You'll have to pack quickly.
EVE: A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex. C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
LUTHOR: A parka.
EVE: You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
LUTHOR: North!
