I'm supposed to get married next month and I really think I should call it off
she and i have been together for 12yrs.  3 kids.  i never really wanted to marry her but i figured, hey, what the heck. 3 kids, 12yrs, etc etc.
Last night my longtime good friend called and asked if he, his wife and 3 children could use my studio bathroom to take showers, get cleaned up, etc.  They have been looking for a place, staying between a tent, in their car and hotels here and there.  I will say yes to this, what is to me a simple request, 100 times out of 100.  I texted my lady about what I was going to do, that it wouldnt take up more than an hour and whats more she wouldnt even see or hear them as this was in a back studio, seperate from the house.
Later that evening when they showed up, my woman flew into a rage, yelling, screaming, mocking me with taunts of 'why dont i just invite all the homeless people in and let them free load."  
Mind you, this was for a shower....in a seperate building...completely out of sight and away from her eyes/ears.
She then really went into overdrive, threw her wedding ring at me, lost it behind the fridge or somewhere, who knows.
Then she wanted to slap my face, i just let her.  my adrenaline prevented me from feeling any of it.  Then she called her mom to get her, told the kids, all who witnessed this juvenile outburst that she wouldnt be living there anymore.
The wedding is in 32days.  I only have 6 people flying in, the rest are local.  I would gladly cancel this thing today, refund the 6 pklane tickets and 3 hotel rooms and let the chips fall where they may.
