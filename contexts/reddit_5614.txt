Will I receive unemployment if I get fired for telling my boss I won't do part of my job anymore?
Little (ok a lot after reading through it) backstory: I accepted a position with a company in Ohio after I graduated college with a BS in Design Engineering Technology. I was led to believe that I would be working with customers to design CNC machines that fit their requirements. In actuality I was hired to be a travelling service mechanic. Every review for 3 years I told my boss I wanted an engineering job, and he always told me I needed to learn the how's and why's before I could design them. Meanwhile I realized that was all bullshit because my company hired fresh graduates to do those jobs anyways.  
  
Two years ago my boss was promoted and my new boss started cracking whips. Made my life a living hell and has me on the road 50-60% of the year while other techs get to stay home quite often, and most of it is no-notice. I started looking for new jobs but we're in a very rural location with little engineering jobs available. I applied on my company's website for an open detailer position, but HR said the company needs me more where I am. So I started branching out back to Michigan where I grew up and all my family lives. It's now been over 5 years with just one phone interview. I was just recently told by a family friend hiring manager that it would be tough finding me a job 5 years out of college with no engineering experience.  
  
So here I am seeing my only way to move up at my current company is to tell my boss I won't travel anymore starting January 1st. My question is if I give him this ultimatum and I'm fired for it, would I still be eligible for unemployment? My plan would be to move back to my parent's house in Michigan so I'd have a permanent address there. At this point getting fired would be a welcomed change to how much I hate my job.
