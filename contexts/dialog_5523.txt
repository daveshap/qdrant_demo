FERGUS: So what's that supposed to mean?
JODY: Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
FERGUS: Why?
JODY: 'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
JODY: See? I was right about you.
FERGUS: Don't be so sure.
JODY: Jody's always right.
JODY: Where would you most like to be now, man?
FERGUS: Doesn't matter where.
JODY: Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
FERGUS: Having a pint in the Rock.
JODY: You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
FERGUS: Like what?
JODY: Like having a pint in the Metro --
FERGUS: Having two pints in the Rock.
JODY: Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
FERGUS: Who's Dil?
JODY: My special friend.
FERGUS: Oh, yeah.
JODY: We got simple tastes, you and me.
FERGUS: The best.
JODY: But you fellas never get a break, do you?
FERGUS: Do you?
JODY: Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
FERGUS: We don't look on it like that.
JODY: I've often wondered how you do it.
FERGUS: Depends on what you believe in.
JODY: What do you believe in?
FERGUS: That you guys shouldn't be here.
JODY: It's as simple as that?
FERGUS: Yes.
JUDE: Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
FERGUS: He's hot.
JUDE: Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
JODY: Have you no feelings, woman?
JUDE: You shut your face --
JUDE: You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
JODY: He's a good soldier, Jude.
JUDE: I said shut the fuck up --
JODY: He believes in the future --
FERGUS: Is it bad?
JODY: No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
FERGUS: I didn't.
JODY: Some kinds of women are...
FERGUS: She can't help it.
JODY: Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
FERGUS: You liked her?
JODY: Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
FERGUS: Don't know her.
JODY: Want you to do something, Fergus.
FERGUS: What?
JODY: If they kill me --
FERGUS: Don't think that way.
JODY: But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
JODY: See if she's all right.
FERGUS: I don't know her.
JODY: Take her picture. C'mere.
