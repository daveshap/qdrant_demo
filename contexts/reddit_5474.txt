An Entry Level Job with 5+ Years Experience
I saw a legitimate job posting today for an entry level position that asked for 5+ years experience. 

It seems like there are so many **entry level** positions that require extensive experience. It was this way when I graduated college (I struggled despite having 2 years industry related part-time experience as a full-time student). Even with professional experience under my belt, it seems like all the entry level jobs that used to require 1-3 years experience now require 3-5 years experience.

After 5 years, shouldn’t you be going for mid-level positions? I just for the life of me cannot understand the expectation of entry level workers needing such extensive experience? I get the idea of working your way up the ladder, it just seems like there’s an expectation to get a mid-level talent in an entry-level position.
