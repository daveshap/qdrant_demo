PAUL: I have to go out to get food.
TATIANA: Go out! Where?
PAUL: To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
TATIANA: No, no.
PAUL: I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
TATIANA: You cannot go alone.
PAUL: I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
PAUL: Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
GREGOIRE: Please, except my humblest apologies...
PAUL: Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
