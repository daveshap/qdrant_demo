PETER: Hey—you not up yet? Come on—come on!
ELLIE'S VOICE: What time is it?
PETER: Eight o'clock.
PETER: Here—
ELLIE: What is it? Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks. You—you had it pressed.
PETER: Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
ELLIE: Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
PETER: Listen, Brat—I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
PETER'S VOICE: ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
ELLIE: Why, you bully. I believe you would.
PETER'S VOICE: —six—seven—eight—nine—
ELLIE: I'm out! I'm out!
PETER: You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage.
ELLIE: Outside!
PETER: Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
ELLIE: I can't go out like this.
PETER: Like what?
ELLIE: Like this. I have no robe.
PETER: Here—take mine.
