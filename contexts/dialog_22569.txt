RUSS: ... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances. His name is Lee. And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
CARTER: Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
RUSS: He is the situation.
CARTER: I'm talking about the girl.
RUSS: Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
CARTER: What kind of assignment is that?
RUSS: Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
CARTER: Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
RUSS: Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
CARTER: What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
RUSS: Just make him think you're following leads. Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit. I don't care. I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved. Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we? His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
