MANAGER: We call you a taxi.
CHILI: Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
MANAGER: Mr. Barboni is a good customer. Works for Jimmy Capp.
CHILI: I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
TOMMY: You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
CHILI: That's what the guy said.
TOMMY: Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
