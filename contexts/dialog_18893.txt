VADA: No nuns, got it.
HARRY: And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
VADA: What does that mean?
HARRY: It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
VADA: Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
HARRY: Thanks, I needed that.
VADA: I'll be back in 137 hours.
HARRY: Have fun.
