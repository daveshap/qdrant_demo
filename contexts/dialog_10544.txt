BO CATLETT: He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
BEAR: Come here, Farrah...
BO CATLETT: I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
BEAR: Farrah. Come here.
BEAR: After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
BO CATLETT: Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
BEAR: What about him?
BO CATLETT: I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
BEAR: And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
BO CATLETT: Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
