NIKI: Joanne?
JAKE: You know her?
NIKI: No. I saw her with Tod.
JAKE: Do you know where she lives?
NIKI: Nah.
JAKE: Do you know where she would be?
JAKE: Where is she?
NIKI: Tod might know.
JAKE: Where's he?
NIKI: Last I heard he went to San Diego.
JAKE: If we went there, would you be able to find him?
NIKI: You're not a film producer, are you?
JAKE: How much do you make a week, Niki?
NIKI: Are you a private detective?
JAKE: Something like that. How much do you make?
NIKI: Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
JAKE: Three hundred?
NIKI: This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
JAKE: I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
NIKI: Up front?
JAKE: Half now, half later.
NIKI: Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
JAKE: Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
NIKI: When do we start?
JAKE: Tonight. When you get out, we'll go. Why didn't you tell the other detective?
NIKI: This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
