TOD: I hear you got money to spend. I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
JAKE: Yeah.
TOD: Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
JAKE: No.
TOD: What you got in mind?
JAKE: I want to meet Ratan.
TOD: What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
JAKE: I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
TOD: You're talking about real excitement?
JAKE: Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
TOD: Who told you about this?
JAKE: Rucker.
TOD: I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
JAKE: Is this with a girl named Kristen?
TOD: Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
JAKE: Well...
TOD: Take it or leave it.
JAKE: Okay.
TOD: Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
JAKE: Good.
