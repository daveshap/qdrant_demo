I lived
I wrote a post [On March 19, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fl8n2m/overdosing_soon/) telling anyone who'd listen that I was going to overdose. And I did. 

But I survived, I was in ICU for a while; I had Acute Respiratory Failure With Hypoxia And Hypercapnia; Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy; Heart fucking stopped. And I was on Mechanically Assisted Ventilation via medically induced coma. *I had failed*

When Medical cleared me, I was moved over to the same hospital's psychiatric ward for 11 days. Once discharged, I was then referred to a PHP, today was my second day. 

But today, the idea that Life keeps telling me "no" on things I want made me start *planning* again. But not an overdose this time, something more.. permanent. But since I've been on a 5051 previously, (this time I wasn't, I was at the ward voluntary; I need help, I know that much and I'm open to getting it) that plan will be much much harder. 

Still, I am alive and I was doing really good! the meds are working, it's just that stray thought that's just started growing. But I'll bring that up tomorrow in PHP. 

Life might always say No to what I want, and Death said no to my needs.. but fuck you - I'm not saying no to getting help!

*I can't*
