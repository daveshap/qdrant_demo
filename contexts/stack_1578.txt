Filter harmonics in AC power line I run a Toshiba Digital copier machine in my shop and the machine started showing error codes related to power issues a few days ago. This happens randomly during daytime. There were no problems at night time. So I have transported my copier machine to an another place during the daytime and used it for a long time with no errors reported. I have concluded that there is harmonic distortion in the power lines of my shop area. Also, I have noted that there is a workshop near me which uses heavy AC motors. I suspect that they cause the issue in the power lines because of malfunctioning equipment.Is there any circuit that can filter these harmonics which I can build? Will using a UPS fix the problem? I have already complained about this to the power company but there seems to be no action taken by them.
