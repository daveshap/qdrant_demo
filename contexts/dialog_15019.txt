MALCOLM: Any damage?
EDDIE: Minimal.
MALCOLM: Minimal" is too much. It has to be light
EDDIE: Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
MALCOLM: You are an academic.
EDDIE: Former academic. Now I actually make things. I don't just talk.
MALCOLM: You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
EDDIE: It doesn't matter what I think.
MALCOLM: Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
KELLY: Hi, Dad.
MALCOLM: Kelly! What are you doing here?
