BLONDE: Well, what then?
LEONARD: It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
BLONDE: Slam it?
LEONARD: Just loud enough to wake me up.
BLONDE: That's it?
LEONARD: That's it.
BLONDE: Should I wear it?
LEONARD: No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
BLONDE: Whatever gets you off.
