ANGELA: Lazarus?
LAZARUS: Oh! Gave me a start.
ANGELA: I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
LAZARUS: You hurt it?
ANGELA: I'm standing most of my day. They're for support. Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
LAZARUS: Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
ANGELA: Well. It's good to see you.
LAZARUS: Angela?
ANGELA: Yes?
LAZARUS: I need to uh...
ANGELA: Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
LAZARUS: My little niece... she got this deep cough.
ANGELA: You take her to a doctor?
LAZARUS: No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just... I don't know what to do.
