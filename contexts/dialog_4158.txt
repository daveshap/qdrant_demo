JEFFREY: Are you Detective Williams?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Yes.
JEFFREY: My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
JEFFREY: He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: You did? A human ear?
JEFFREY: Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
