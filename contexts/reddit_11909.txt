I feel like I'll never be happy
I've been depressed my whole life, so I've pretty much grown accustomed to it, but lately it's been worse. 
Small things are starting to annoy me. Some examples are:
2 of my best friends are in a relationship, but when I think about them together, I get aggravated and annoyed. I don't know why. Maybe I'm jealous of what they have, or maybe it's the fact that since they've been dating, they barely give me attention anymore. 
Also, I go back to college in a little over a month, and I have a decent life there. A lot of friends, a girl or 2 I'd like to date, and supportive professors, but I have absolutely no desire to go back. I don't been care about seeing my friends. 

I haven't been happy since.....well I can't remember the last time I was happy. Nothing excites me anymore, and I'm starting to hate people more and more every day. 

I know this might not be as big of a post as some people make, but I just needed to get his out of my head. 

My final words are from a confession bear I saw one time that really spoke to me: "The only reason I don't kill myself, is because I know how it will negatively affect my family and friends."
