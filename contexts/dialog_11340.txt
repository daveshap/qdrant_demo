SKYLAR: Free?
WILL: Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
SEAN: I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.
LAMBEAU: This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
SEAN: Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
SEAN: Yeah.
LAMBEAU: He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
SEAN: And he mailed it to Hardy--
LAMBEAU: --That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
SEAN: Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
LAMBEAU: They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
SEAN: Why me?
LAMBEAU: I need someone with your kind of background.
SEAN: My kind of background?
LAMBEAU: You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
SEAN: He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
LAMBEAU: Five.
