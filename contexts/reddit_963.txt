Do y'all, especially those with GAD, get really really irritated some days when your anxiety is high? Like anything makes you feel like a ball of flames on the inside but on the outside everything thinks your being sweet as always?
Just curious

edit: severe irritability is a symptom of many different anxiety disorders. Especially GAD, ptsd and while its not tech an anxiety disorder anymore, ocd.
