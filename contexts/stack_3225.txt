How does the barrier at kings cross tell the difference between a normal passerby muggle and a muggle born witch or wizard? It seems like it would be quite hard to tell the difference between a muggle born witch/wizard and a normal muggle just passing by, they seem to be virtually the same except for the witch/wizards potential or capability to perform magic.
