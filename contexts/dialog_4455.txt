PRIEST: Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
SMECKER: Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
PRIEST: What is it my son?
SMECKER: It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
PRIEST: God's permission? God doesn't...
SMECKER: But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
PRIEST: You believe?
SMECKER: Yes.
PRIEST: You feel?
SMECKER: Yes.
PRIEST: You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
SMECKER: Has he now?
PRIEST: You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
SMECKER: I guess not.
PRIEST: It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
SMECKER: You're right.
PRIEST: Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
SMECKER: I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
PRIEST: Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
SMECKER: I believe these young men are right.
PRIEST: You know them personally?
SMECKER: Yes.
PRIEST: Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
SMECKER: No. They would never do that.
