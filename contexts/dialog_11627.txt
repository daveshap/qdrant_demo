ROY: Myra followed you, huh?
LILLY: She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
ROY: No.
LILLY: No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
ROY: I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
LILLY: As though you do what I say.
ROY: That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?
