EDDIE: Come now. Did you see the gun?
MS. GORDON: I can describe it.
EDDIE: Oh really?
MS. GORDON: It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
EDDIE: You can't remember that -- !
MS. GORDON: I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
EDDIE: How can you remember that?
MS. GORDON: I didn't take my eyes off it!
EDDIE: Ah.
