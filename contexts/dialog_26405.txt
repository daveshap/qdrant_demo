GUS: Yeah? How's it look?
ROSS: It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
GUS: I told you it wasn't no jive.
ROSS: Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it."
GUS: Stone mutha.
ROSS: Exactly. Stoned mother.
ROSS: But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
GUS: Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do? I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
ROSS: Can you do that?
GUS: Yeah, sure. Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
ROSS: Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
GUS: Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot. You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
