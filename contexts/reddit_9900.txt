Research help
For a class research project, I'd like to do some qualitative work around if and how IHEs communicate with students in the wake of political activity like an election or new relevant laws. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find much (any) literature in the searches I've done. Can anyone suggest a specific angle that would be of interest in this realm? Thank you.
