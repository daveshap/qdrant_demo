Can the Democratic Party replace Joe Biden as its nominee for the presidential election?
[Joe Biden is the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for the presidential race and other major candidates have already suspended their campaigns](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-presidential-delegates-tracker/), but the national convention where the nominee will be officially chosen is still [three months away](https://www.wisn.com/article/dnc-convention-delayed-to-august-due-to-coronavirus/32018109). In light of [a developing controversy about a sexual assault allegation against Biden](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/woman-broadens-claims-against-biden-include-sexual-assault-n1182296), Elizabeth Bruenig [writes in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/opinion/joe-biden-tara-reade.html) that Democrats need to "consider a plan B":

> I have my own impressions regarding Ms. Reade’s allegations, but no one — save Ms. Reade and Mr. Biden — knows with certainty whether her claims are true. What I can assert with firm conviction is that Democrats ought to start considering a backup plan for 2020. 

If Democrats do change their minds and no longer think Biden is their strongest candidate for the November election, this raises several questions about their other options:

* Procedurally, how would it work? If Biden withdraws, does the nomination automatically go to the runner-up (currently Bernie Sanders), or are the delegates pledged to Biden reassigned in some way?
* If Biden doesn't choose to withdraw voluntarily, can the party disqualify him anyway, within its current rules?
* If Biden receives the nomination and names a running mate, but he departs the race before Election Day, can he still be replaced or is his former running mate then the effective presidential candidate?
* How much leverage the remaining state primary elections hold if Democratic voters quickly change their mind about Biden?
* What is the timeline of when certain options become impossible for the Democratic Party?

late EDIT: my previous phrasing was incorrect because the other candidates have [suspended their campaigns but not officially withdrawn](https://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/10/what-does-suspending-mean-2/), so Biden could theoretically withdraw in a more real sense than his former rivals have done, which might have implications for party procedure
