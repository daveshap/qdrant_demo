BARON: It's always so quiet here.
PIMENOV: If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
BARON: My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
PIMENOV: No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
