VERONICA: I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
J.D.: I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
VERONICA: It's over, J.D. Over!
J.D.: I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
