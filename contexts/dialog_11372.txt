CHUCKIE: Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
MORGAN: Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
CHUCKIE: Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
WILL: So, you finally got a job Morgan?
MORGAN: Had one, now I'm fucked again.
WILL: So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?
