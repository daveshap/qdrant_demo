HANNAH: Have you tried these? These are wonderful. Holly and her friend made them.
ELLIOT: They're fantastic.
HANNAH: Aren't they great?
ELLIOT: Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
HANNAH: I know! I know!
HANNAH: She has all the cooking talent.
ELLIOT: No, she doesn't, either. You've got tons as well.
HANNAH: Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
