WES: When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic. Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war. They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs. They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy. America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out: They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert. They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost. It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something. And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis. See how I mean?
JAEGER: We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
WES: You actually got around to killing someone. I'm impressed. I guess you're only half a bitch.
EPPS: Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next. Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
WES: Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
EPPS: Wes--
WES: Look, I know you guys are telling the truth. It's just the Shi'ites don't know that. I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
