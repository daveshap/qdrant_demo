VNC on Ubuntu 18.04 I have found a couple of tutorials on this...but they all suggest installing a separate desktop shell to really use this. But, I do have Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop installed, since this is a local server, and which is actually connected to my monitor. But, it is really inconvenient to keep swapping my keyboard and mouse cords to the little Ubuntu box... Instead, I'd just like to use the GUI from my main computer.How do I set up a VNC server, that will bring me to the very screen of my Ubuntu login? I have already enabled automated login, now I just would like to access it's screen so I can use a few GUI-only applications.
