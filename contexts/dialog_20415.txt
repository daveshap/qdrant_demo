FOLEY: You coming back?
KAREN: I'm just going to the bathroom.
KAREN: I want you to know something. I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
FOLEY: Why are you mad?
KAREN: Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill. Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
FOLEY: What about <i>my</i> motive? Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal. You think I will?
KAREN: I don't know.
