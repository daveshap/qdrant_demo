BERNSTEIN: --Jesus--
WOODWARD: --he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
BRADLEE: --I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
SIMONS: --Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
ROSENFELD: --listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
SIMONS: --go over your sources again--
WOODWARD: --Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
BERNSTEIN: --and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
ROSENFELD: --listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
SIMONS: --Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
ROSENFELD: --maybe I'm tense--
BRADLEE: --well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House-- --it would be nice if we were right--
SIMONS: --you double-checked both sources?--
BRADLEE: --Bernstein, are you sure on this story?
BERNSTEIN: Absolutely--
BRADLEE: --what about you?--
WOODWARD: --I'm sure--
BRADLEE: --I'm not sure, it still feels thin--
