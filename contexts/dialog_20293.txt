NOLAN: Who asked him here?
FATHER BARRY: Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
NOLAN: The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
TERRY: Keep Charley out of this.
NOLAN: You don't think he'd be— helpful?
TERRY: Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
NOLAN: Maybe I will— one of these days.
TERRY: One of these days.
FATHER BARRY: Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one? Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
NOLAN: Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
FATHER BARRY: D 'n D?
NOLAN: Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
