Is it possible to connect with Hainan Airlines from India/Bangladesh? I am looking into the option of visiting Mexico with a direct flight of Hainan Airlines from PEK, Beijing. But I cannot find any flight option to fly from India or Bangladesh that would connect with the Hainan flight, enabling me to have a single itinerary and PNR, allowing me to use the 24-hour Chinese transit without visa.I have a Bangladeshi passport, with only Indian and Mexican visas on it. Any suggestion?Thanks.
