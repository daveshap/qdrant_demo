MANAGER: You're hand is bleeding.
BARRY: I cut myself.
MANAGER: How?
BARRY: On my knife.
MANAGER: Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
BARRY: I didn't do that.
BARRY: Why? ...what?
MANAGER: Your hand is bleeding.
BARRY: I know.
MANAGER: I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
BARRY: Why?
MANAGER: Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
BARRY: I didn't do it.
MANAGER: Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
BARRY: Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
MANAGER: I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
BARRY: Please don't do this to me.
MANAGER: The police are on their way.
BARRY: Sorry.
BARRY: Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
MANAGER: That's fine.
