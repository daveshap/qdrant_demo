Working for a company that started layoffs. Should I start looking?
I [25 F] am working in IT for a pharmaceutical company. They aren't performing amazingly financially and the impacts have started showing. Financials aren't bad, they just aren't growing at the rate they'd like to. This week, 7 people in my department got laid off. I've been working here for about 3 years now. I've always gotten good reviews and am in good standings with my management team, too. I love my job and the company and dont want to leave, but I dont want to get the boot and be left unemployed. How can I tell if it's time to start looking for a new job?
