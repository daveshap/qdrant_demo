Importance of C statistic in logistic regression I am working on a dataset with 1500 cancer patients. The research question is impact of various patient and surgery related variables on disease specific mortality. So the outcome/dependent variable is a binary. I ran logistic regression to assess effects of variables on outcome. The variables were chosen after univariate analysis based on the p value &lt;0.25. Hosmer-lemeshow test confirmed goodness of fit of the model. But on calculating the C statistic the AUC was 0.65. Can both these tests contradict each other? If so, then what conclusion can i derive about the predictive ability of the model?
