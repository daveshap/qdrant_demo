MAX: Where is it?
ORDELL: Is that what I think it is?
JACKIE: What do you think it is?
ORDELL: I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
JACKIE: You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
ORDELL: What the hell you doin'?
JACKIE: Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
ORDELL: Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
JACKIE: The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
ORDELL: Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
JACKIE: Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
ORDELL: Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
JACKIE: I said, you understand what I'm saying
ORDELL: I understand woman, damn!
JACKIE: Go sit over in that chair.
ORDELL: I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
JACKIE: Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
