WIFE: What kind of a crash was it?
NORMAN: You seen my suitcase?
WIFE: There's nothing on the news about a crash. Did he say what airline?
NORMAN: He didn't say much at all. Honey --
WIFE: In the closet. I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
NORMAN: Don't be so supportive, honey.
WIFE: Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
NORMAN: Four. Four years --
WIFE: Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
NORMAN: Keep watching the news. Are you watching the news?
WIFE: How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
WIFE: There's a U.S. Navy car outside, Norman.
NORMAN: What?
WIFE: Was it a military crash?
NORMAN: I don't know.
WIFE: They never used to send a Navy car.
