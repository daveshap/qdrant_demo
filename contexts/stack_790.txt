Static IP with NetPlan I have a dev server with a Comcast static ip that has worked wonderfully for 10 years...went to upgrade to Ubuntu 18.04 and whats this NetPlan biznezz and why will it not accept my subnet?Followed all documentation from Comcast (like I have every other time I have formatted this machine) and it is asking for xx.xx.xx.xx/xx bit set.I generally know what this means but I am lost...Let me be a tad bit clearer...I am doing a fresh install and choosing my network device from the start...so essentially setting up the netplan config from \"go\"....
