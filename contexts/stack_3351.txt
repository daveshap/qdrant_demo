Old Fantasy Series about a group of college roleplayers who are transported to the alternate world of their professor The stories were based on a group of college roleplayers who were transported to the alternate world of their professor (the Dungeon Master). There were multiple books in the series. My memory of the stories has faded but I can remember slavers and the college kids introducing gunpowder to this new world.
