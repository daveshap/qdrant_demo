STAN: This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
KYLE: We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
CARTMAN: Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
KYLE: Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
CARTMAN: Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
