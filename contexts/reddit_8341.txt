in May, 2017 After high ranking Russian officials visited White House, where [only Russian media agency was allowed](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/us/politics/trump-russia-meeting-american-reporters-blocked.html) is there a way for public or government officials not present at the meeting to see official correspondence?
