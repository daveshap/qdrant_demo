How do I use a PARTUUID in fstab? I needed to increase the size of my boot partition (I already removed old kernels with autoremove).I increased the size of my drive (VM), and created a new partition.  I did all things wonderful to make the new partition /boot.  Blkid shows sda1 UUID=1234 PARTUUID=5678-01 and the new partition sda3 UUID=1234 PARTUUID=5678-03.I tried adding PARTUUID=\"5678-03\" /boot to my fstab but it didn't boot (it works with /dev/sda3 /boot).Since partitions 1 and 3 are on the same disk (and the same UUID) how can I enter that in fstab?
