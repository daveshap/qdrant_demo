Long lived auth session for native mobile app I\u2019m working on mobile app which should have both good security and UX.My backend stores credentials on its side. There is no 3rd-party auth services. Also the app shouldn\u2019t have web views as part of auth process. And finally it should have long-lived session.At first I was thinking about usual short access and long refresh token system. However, as long as mobile apps are downloaded on user devices I can\u2019t be sure that someone won\u2019t stole some of this tokens. So basically there is even no reason to make this two tokens.So may be there\u2019s some other way to authenticate user more securely with having features described above?
