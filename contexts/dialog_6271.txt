VINCENT: Client? I like to think of myself as more of a friend. A mentor.
IDA: Max never had many friends. So much with the piano. Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
MAX: I'm...in...the...room, here. Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
IDA: What's he sayin'?
MAX: I'm standing right here.
IDA: Yesss, you are. He's artistic.
VINCENT: I'm sure you're very proud of Max.
IDA: Of course I'm proud. You know he started with nothing? Look at him today. Playing concerts.
MAX: Mom, Vincent's not interested.
VINCENT: Oh, I'm captivated.
