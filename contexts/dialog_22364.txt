GREGOR: It's quite satifactory.
DEIRDRE: Good, because it cost enough. There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
GREGOR: I intend to. This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand. With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
DEIRDRE: You sure about this?
GREGOR: I'd stake my reputation.
DEIRDRE: But would you stake your life, that's the question...
GREGOR: In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
SWEDE: You should watch what you eat.
LARRY: Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
SWEDE: I'm just worried about your health, Larry. You could stand to shed a few pounds.
LARRY: And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
SWEDE: Who you calling dumb, dickless?
