JAEGER: At-at-at-at-at. At-at-at-at-at.
EPPS: What are you doing?
JAEGER: What does it look like I'm doing? I'm killing Iraqis. At-at-at-at-at. At-at- at-at--
WES: Could you stop, please. You're giving me a headache.
JAEGER: A headache?
WES: Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable.
JAEGER: I'm making you uncomfortable. Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you. But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
WES: Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. Yes.
JAEGER: Okay.
JAEGER: At-at-at-at-at.
EPPS: Knock it off!
JAEGER: Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
EPPS: Ready for what? What are you supposed to be doing?
JAEGER: I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
EPPS: No you're not.
