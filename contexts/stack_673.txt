Simple Way to Have Static Local IP with VPN I am trying to find a simple solution to have a static \"Local\" IP Address with Ubuntu 16.04 and Open VPN. Every time I use the VPN the IP Adress changes from 10.36.10.10 to some other random IP address and I want to run a Minecraft Server from my PC while still being hidden in a VPN. I'm really not sure if this is even possible or secure but changing the Address of the server at each VPN activation is certainly not going to work. Any Help is appreciated! I have figured out a way to Have PIA VPN assign a Static External IP Address but the Minecraft Client does not recognize this Address when trying to connect to the Server, (I'm assuming it's a Port Issue) but in my region, assigning a Port is not available, I must use a VPN Server in Canada which will ruin the game PING.
