Canadian Finance Scene
I started my first year at York University (Commerce Finance) this year for my fall term.  I was a little hesitant whether I made the right decision for the next four years of my life and started to think about jobs.  I was wondering that whether my Bcom Finance York degree would land me a job in the next four years time.  I started to read what some people were saying on Reddit and majority of them said that in Canada the top business schools are as ranked, Ivey, UofT, Schulich, and Queens.  I was surprised to hear this and started to search for facts that back up these claims.  I looked hard and could not find anything until I came across LinkedIn and started to see closer and finer specific detail.  I looked up CITI the banking company and to my surprise in Canada the majority top three that were hired were UofT, Waterloo, and York.  UofT was never a surprise but Ivey, and Queens struck me.  Ivey, Queens AND Schulich were listed below normal York finance students.  Now my question to you is what may be the reason for this?  People are saying and thinking another thing while in the actually statistical data they are blantantly wrong and ignorant.  What is the cause of this madness?
