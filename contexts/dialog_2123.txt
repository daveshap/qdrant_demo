CHRIS: Cheers Katka!
KATKA: Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
CHRIS: I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
KATKA: I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
CHRIS: No, you guys are great together. He'll come through, I'm sure.
CHRIS: Who's your friend?
DOUG: That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
DOUG: Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
DOUG: What did the beer cost?
CHRIS: Fifteen crowns.
DOUG: This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
CHRIS: Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
