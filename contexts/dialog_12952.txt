DENNIS: You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
TALLEY: Only if you try to grab me. We could've shot you from the wall.
TALLEY: You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
DENNIS: Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
TALLEY: I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
DENNIS: Maybe that's what I'm doing. Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
