HANA: What are you up to?
KIP: That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember? That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge. It's red hot.
KIP: When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
HANA: I should go to the house, get breakfast.
KIP: The lamp was burning all night in his room. Caravaggio was there with him.
KIP: This is hot!
HANA: Nya-nya-nya!
CARAVAGGIO: And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
THE PATIENT: Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise. To come back for her. And then of course I couldn'tâ€¦ I couldn't even do that properly.
CARAVAGGIO: You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you. You killed my friends, you ruined my hands. But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
THE PATIENT: You can't kill me. I died years ago.
CARAVAGGIO: No, now I can't kill you.
