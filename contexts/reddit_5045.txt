Received a rejection email, with potential for another position? How should I reply?
Hi guys,   


For context, I applied for a position at an international company and after three rounds and some amount of time, I received a rejection email. The email was from one of the person who interviewed me, and below are just some of the things mentioned, quote on quote:  


*"Unfortunately, although you were in our final three candidates, we have had to make the difficult decision to offer the role to the candidate who had more relevant experience. However you really were an exceptional candidate and I do hope you will consider other openings at \[COMPANY\] in the future."*  


This I understood, as I was a fresh graduate with only internships under my belt. The people who interviewed me were exceptionally nice and honest, which I deeply appreciated. So I wasn't too sad when I received the rejection email. However, the email ends with:

*"On a personal note, if you'd ever like to speak to me about any other roles that we post then I'm always happy to chat. I'm aware you've also applied for the \[XXX SPECIFIC ROLE I AM ALSO INTERESTED IN\] role so I will look forward to reviewing that application."*  


On another occasion (on the phone) prior to the rejection email, he also mentioned that he is aware and has noted I've applied for this specific \[XXX\] role. I am also more interested in this role than the previous one I got rejected for, actually. My question is, how should I reply and indicate my interest? Also, how should one graciously and genuinely thank the interviewers for their time and honesty? I thoroughly enjoyed all three interview rounds I had with the people who interviewed me.  


Any advice is appreciated!
