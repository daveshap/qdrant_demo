CATHERINE: I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!""
MRS. PILLETTI: It's her baby too, you know.
CATHERINE: That's my son Thomas's baby.
MRS. PILLETTI: Well, it ain't your baby.
CATHERINE: Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
MRS. PILLETTI: You told me.
CATHERINE: She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
MRS. PILLETTI: What happen?
CATHERINE: She gave me the evil eye.
MRS. PILLETTI: Ufa!
CATHERINE: I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
MRS. PILLETTI: Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me.
CATHERINE: Ah?
MRS. PILLETTI: You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
CATHERINE: Who?
MRS. PILLETTI: Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
CATHERINE: When was this?
MRS. PILLETTI: This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
CATHERINE: What they say?
MRS. PILLETTI: You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
CATHERINE: My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
MRS. PILLETTI: Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
CATHERINE: So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
MRS. PILLETTI: Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
CATHERINE: It pains that they should do this.
MRS. PILLETTI: I know it pains.
