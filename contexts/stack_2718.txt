Diffusion vs Advection As defined in Wikipedia; diffusion is the net movement of molecules or atoms from a region of high concentration (or high chemical potential) to a region of low concentration (or low chemical potential) as a result of random motion of the molecules or atoms. Whereas advection is the transport of a substance by bulk motion;that is the movement of fluids down a pressure or temperature gradient.My confusion is that: when there is a high concentration of some quantity, doesn't that mean also a high pressure of this quantity ? This thought makes me see diffusion and advection the same..
