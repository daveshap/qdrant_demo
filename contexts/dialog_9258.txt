JERRY: Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
YOUNGER MAN: Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
JERRY: Shep said 8:30.
YOUNGER MAN: We been sitting here an hour. I've peed three times already.
JERRY: I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
YOUNGER MAN: Ya got the car?
JERRY: Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
YOUNGER MAN: Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then. I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
JERRY: Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
YOUNGER MAN: Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
JERRY: Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.
JERRY: ...So I guess that's it, then. Here's the keys -
CARL: No, that's not it, Jerry.
JERRY: Huh?
CARL: The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
JERRY: Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
CARL: Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
JERRY: Well, okay, it's -
CARL: Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
JERRY: Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
CARL: Yeah, you already said that.
JERRY: Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
CARL: I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
JERRY: Okay.
CARL: I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
JERRY: Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
CARL: You want your own wife kidnapped?
JERRY: Yah.
CARL: ...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks? - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
JERRY: Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
CARL: What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
JERRY: Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
CARL: So why don't you just ask him for the money?
GRIMSRUD: Or your fucking wife, you know.
CARL: Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
JERRY: Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it. So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
CARL: Personal matters.
JERRY: Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
CARL: Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
JERRY: Hon? Got the growshries.
VOICE: Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
JERRY: Yah, real good.
VOICE: Dad's here.
