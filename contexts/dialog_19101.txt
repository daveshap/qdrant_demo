NAPOLEON: Who is there?
BERTRAND: Bertrand, sire.
NAPOLEON: I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
BERTRAND: Yes, sire?
NAPOLEON: She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
BERTRAND: No, sire... I was asleep.
NAPOLEON: I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms.
