Thoughts on getting a Ph.D.?
I'll be graduating in less than a month with my Master's Degree but really want to continue to pursue my education and have found some programs that really interest me. I'd be interested in applying this year to join the cohort for 2021. 

However, my goal is to be a career or academic counselor and I'm worried that heading into a Ph.D. so soon might make me over-educated and under-experienced and hurt my chances of finding work.

What are your thoughts on this?
