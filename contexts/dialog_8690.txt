CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Yeah?
JOEL: Did you send this? Is it a joke?
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: I probably got the same thing as you.
JOEL: I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE: Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
JOEL: That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
