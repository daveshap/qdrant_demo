i like a guy but i cant help being mean to him
Hi everybody

im kinda new to using reddit so any general advice is appreciated, i just need to write this all down somewhere because i feel like im gonna go crazy if i dont

theres a guy(17) in my class who was new to the school this year, and during the first couple days of school i felt something i cant rlly describe when i'd look/think about him, but i shrugged it off and never made much of it

and slowly as the year's been going by i took to being super mean to him, swearing at him and spraying water at him, scribbling on his papers, and whipping chalk or shoes or whatever else at him... and its always me who starts acting nasty first, but he doesnt hesitate to reciprocate, although hes really shy and not too talkative

and i dont hate him and ive never hated him,,i actually really like him and ive begun to notice it more and more the past few weeks

i cant get myself to throw stuff at him anymore, or destroy his papers, but now when i see him i dont know what to do if it isn't something nasty, i genuinely just dont know what to say to him

he isn't one to initiate conversations but i really wanna restart with him and get closer to him because hes really sweet, i found a way to partner up with him during class once and i made it look like it was random, but i got to work with him and talk a bit and hes super chill, plus when im nice to him hes nice to me back, he sorta just reciprocates my energy

but outside of that class i cant find words to tell him that arent mean, i just get snappy and defensive for no reason to him even though inside i feel rlly warm n fuzzy being around him, and ive realized that im obviously attracted to him,i think about him all the time,

except i dont know how to interact with him in a way which conveys my interest in him, especially given everyhting ive already done to him

im already horrible when it comes to the whole flirting situation, and i have no clue how to switch from being a bully to a person that is pleasant to be around

idk how to reflect my interest towards him through my words/actions heLP

TLDR: im mean asf to the guy i like and idk how to change my behaviour around him, i wanna show interest but i never know what to say or do ,, where do i start?
