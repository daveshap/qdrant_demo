NICK: Beth. I didn't mean what I said. About --
BETH: Yes you did. I'm a big girl. I can handle it.
ANDREWS: Take care, you hear?
NICK: Did you find out about her parents?
ANDREWS: You're on leave, man. You're on psycho leave. I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
NICK: You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
ANDREWS: The boat blew. There was a leak in the gas line. There were two previous repairs. There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em. A real heavy investigation. Zilch. Goose-egg. It was an accident.
NICK: Thanks.
LT. WALKER: I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen. They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
NICK: She killed him.
LT. WALKER: Beth? Now you've got Beth killing people?
NICK: Catherine Tramell. It's part of her game.
LT. WALKER: First you've got her buying your file. Now you've got her killing Nilsen. Forget her, willya? Go someplace. Sit in the sun. Get away from this goddamn fog. Get her out of your system.
NICK: You don't but it, do you? She knew nobody would but it. She knew I'd say she did it. And she knew nobody would buy it.
