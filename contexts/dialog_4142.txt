GEORGE: Holy shit, Dulli!
KEVIN: Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
GEORGE: That was it. Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details. My end was roughly five-hundred thousand. Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand. Start over somewhere. One final score. That's all I needed.
AUGUSTO: Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie. Why don't we start small?
GEORGE: No. I have the space. I figured it out. This is what I want to do.
AUGUSTO: Alright. I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you. I don't think there will be a problem.
GEORGE: Five-thousand per kilo.
AUGUSTO: Ha ha. That's too much, Georgie. Those days are over. The rate is one-thousand dollars. Inflation, you know?
GEORGE: This is a one time thing, Gusto. One and I'm out. Give me a good price for old time's sake. What do you think?
GEORGE: Let me ask you something. If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
KRISTINA: You mean, like a trip?
GEORGE: Yeah, sure, whatever.
