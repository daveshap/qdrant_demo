Met a guy who feels like my best friend
We started as friends. Know so much about each other because we shared openly at first with no expectations.

We developed feelings and now we are together.

We talk a lot because we never get sick of each other and genuinely enjoy talking. we call it "intellectual crack"

is this a bad thing to communicate throughout the day a lot in the beginning of a relationship?
