Does anybody feel anxious to the point where they want to vomit?
It happens to me every day and I donâ€™t even know where my anxiety is coming from. 

Edit: WOW. Thank you everyone for commenting and giving advice (honestly did not expect to get an answer)! I hope you can all pull through and feel better <3
