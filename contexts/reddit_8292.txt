Who does Robert Mueller report to and who decides his budget and how long the investigation is allowed to go for?
[Reuters are reporting](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-lawyer-exclusive-idUSKBN1AH5F9) that Robert S. Mueller III is hiring a 16th member of the independent [Special Counsel investigation team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Special_Counsel_investigation).

Mueller was [appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/17/us/politics/document-Robert-Mueller-Special-Counsel-Russia.html).

But is that really where the influence ends? Who decides how much budget he has? Can Rosenstein or anyone else influence the investigation by limiting the budget or vetoing staff hires? Or by other means like imposing an unrealistic timeline? 

How often and to whom does he have to report to make sure he's using the funds appropriately and is this an area for potential influence?

Does such a line of reporting and oversight mean someone like Rosenstein is actually privy to what Mueller has found so far and what he's planning?

Ultimately what's the effect on the independence of the investigation?

Edit: The practical questions are answered in the comments. The question remains as to how much influence this permits. Theoretically it's a lot, and it's not clear how Rosenstein's decision making can be challenged. Sessions can't, Trump won't. We're relying on Rosenstein's personal ethics (which seem to be holding up). In practice I hope that if Mueller feels he can't do a proper job he'd go public. Any thoughts?
