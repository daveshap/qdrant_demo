UMPIRE: Don't bump me.
CRASH: It was a cocksucking call!
UMPIRE: Did you call me a cocksucker?
CRASH: No! I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!

CRASH: You spit on me!
UMPIRE: I didn't spit on you!
CRASH: You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
UMPIRE: You're close, Crash, you want me to run you? I'll run you!
CRASH: You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
UMPIRE: Try it! Go ahead. Call me a cocksucker!
CRASH: Beg me!
UMPIRE: Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
CRASH: Beg me again!
UMPIRE: Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
CRASH: You're a cocksucker!
UMPIRE: You're outta here!
