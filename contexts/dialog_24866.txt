TAYLOR: Dawn. Come in.
DAWN: Taylor! Where are you?
TAYLOR: I'm in the bridge.
DAWN: Barnes?
TAYLOR: He's out of the equation. Talk to me.
DAWN: I'm about to blow the wall.
TAYLOR: Hurry. You have to get them out of there!
DAWN: How does the distress signal look?
TAYLOR: Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
DAWN: I'll do my best.
DAWN: So what's going to happen to you?
TAYLOR: I'm staying with the ship. I'll be all right. Now hurry.
DAWN: Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
TAYLOR: Hopefully sooner than later.
DAWN: Sooner than later.
TAYLOR: Over and out.
