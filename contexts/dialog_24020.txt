DETECTIVE: Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
VIKTOR: It wasn't her body. It was her body of work.
DETECTIVE: Why don't you just come clean, Viktor? Tell the truth. You'll feel better afterwards.
VIKTOR: I am telling the truth.
DETECTIVE: We all know what happened. In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
VIKTOR: No!! I can prove it to you. I'll take you to her.
