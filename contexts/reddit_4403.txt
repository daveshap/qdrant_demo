Sitting in a public bathroom crying
I don't even know internet strangers I could really use some kind words. I've had a lot of sleepless nights, days spent with $0 in the bank account and no one checking up on me. 

but today. Today just feels fucking impossible. I'm tired of ending up in this situation. I want a job, I want to stop letting people down, I want to stop letting myself down. 

I'm supposed to catch a fucking bus in like 10 minutes and it all feels like too much. Everyone around me feels like a hollow husk who judges me for being teary eyed in public and moves on. I honestly would rather throw myself off a crane than catch this bus.
