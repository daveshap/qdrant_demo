MOTHER: Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
TRAVELLER: I only just heard of Conor. I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
MOTHER: You're a kind man to be sure.
TRAVELLER: I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
MOTHER: Steven, Conor didn't die.
TRAVELLER: But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
MOTHER: They were Steven, they were. It's been a miracle it has. He lasted right through and healed. No one in the village has ever seen anything like it. Ever.
