Calculating the Thevenin Voltage of this circuit What I did was apply kirchoff's voltage law to the closed network with the 2 resistors and the voltage source to calculate the voltage of the resistors.I got U - 2*Uresistor =0 &lt;=> Uresistor =5VThen, did the same to the closed network with a, b and the one resistor and got that UThevenin=5VHowever, the answer is 10V. What did I do wrong?Also, is there a way to do this by calculating the current first, and then applying the formula U=RI?
