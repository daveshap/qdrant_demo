GEARY: I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
JACOB: This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
GEARY: The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
JACOB: Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
GEARY: Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
