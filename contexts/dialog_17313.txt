NEO: But what?
ORACLE: But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
NEO: I'm not the One.
ORACLE: Sorry, kid. You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
NEO: What?
ORACLE: Your next life, maybe. Who knows. That's how these things go.
ORACLE: What's funny?
NEO: Morpheus. He almost had me convinced.
ORACLE: I know. Poor Morpheus. Without him we are lost. We will never find the One.
NEO: What do you mean, without him?
