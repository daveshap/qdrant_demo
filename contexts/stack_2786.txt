Can black holes effect light or just what the light reflects off of Can light be shifted or stopped by anything other than a solid? I ask because when observing black holes you can see light funneling into the sphere. My thought was that if what\u2019s being pulled into the black hole is light or just a reflection of light off matter such as cosmic dust, dark matter or any material a drift in space? Also I cannot confirm any components of dark matter.
