Help please idk what to do
I am a 16 year old kid that goes to the gym 5-6 times a week. I am having a lot of trouble sleeping. I got school at 7:15 in the morning I get up at 6:32 but every night I try to go to bed by 9 pm so I get 9 and 1/2 hours sleep. But every time I get in bed at 9 I can’t fall asleep and I look into the blackness for hours untill it’s 3 then I fall asleep. I’m so tired and miserable every morning even though I’ve been trying to set back my internal clock I’m trying to train my body to sleep at 9. I don’t drink caffeine or any stimulants that would keep me up.
I do smoke  weed  and when I don’t could that be a reason why I’m not sleeping. I really just want advice cause I try so hard to sleep so I can be clear headed and function the next morning and so my muscles can heal and not be sore but my body is like nope you don’t need sleep and then I feel like really bad.
