ILSA: Be careful.
LASZLO: Of course, I'll be careful.
CARL: Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
RICK: How long can I afford to stay closed?
CARL: Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
RICK: Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
CARL: Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
RICK: Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
CARL: I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
RICK: -- Don't tell me where you're going.
CARL: I won't.
RICK: Goodnight.
CARL: Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
RICK: How did you get in?
ILSA: The stairs from the street.
RICK: I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
ILSA: Richard, I had to see you.
RICK: You use Richard" again? We're back in Paris."
ILSA: Please.
RICK: Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
ILSA: You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
RICK: I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
ILSA: I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
RICK: Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
ILSA: It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
RICK: I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
ILSA: Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
RICK: -- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
ILSA: Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
RICK: -- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
