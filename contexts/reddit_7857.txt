Have you ever failed to reproduce results that your own research group published? How has that affected you?
I'm a graduate student in a well-respected lab, and I've just spent three years of my life inadvertently disproving several core conclusions from a paper my lab published just before I joined. I now have to start a totally new project at the end of my fourth year of my PhD, and I don’t get to publish any of the work I’ve done up to this point because it would make my lab look bad. I know several other people from my own school who have been in similar situations with various degrees of professional impact. 

I want to hear your story. Have you, or someone you know, disproven or failed to reproduce your lab’s previously published work? How has that affected you? Even if it was just a side project, please share. Even if you aren’t sure whether the problem is you, or the previous researcher, I want to hear your story.
