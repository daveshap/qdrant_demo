What's the best English term for a person who is psychologically attracted to extraordinary beliefs? I know several such people, and what characterizes them is that they fall in love at first sight with any belief that involves extraordinary theories and occurrences or unseen entities. Natural explanations are boring to them---the more fantastic the explanation, the better it is. Usually, if they believe in one such thing, e.g., in Oriental medicine, you can bet they also believe in all of them: homeopathy and all fashions of \"alternative\" medicine, parapsychology and telekinesis, near-death experiences, New Age beliefs, alien abduction, haunted houses, \"Elvis lives,\"the whole shebang. Theirs is not just a belief---it's a passion. They seem to derive great psychological satisfaction tumbling these things in their minds, and when speaking about them, they have a particular blissful expression on their faces. Steven Spielberg got it right in his movie \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"---note the Second Coming-type expression on the faces of the affected Earthlings.But I couldn't find any English term that defines such people, be it a single- or a multiple-word term. It's a shame if there's none.
