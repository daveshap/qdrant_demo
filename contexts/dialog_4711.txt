WILLIAM: Your father doesn't like me, does he?
MARION: It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
WILLIAM: Thank you for accepting.
MARION: Thank you for inviting.
WILLIAM: I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
MARION: You are. And I'll come again.
