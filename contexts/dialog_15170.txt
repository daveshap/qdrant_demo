BIZZLEBEK: These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
KAFKA: Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
BIZZLEBEK: Where do you get your ideas? Only joking -- I'm just joking. Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
KAFKA: I haven't got the energy. I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
BIZZLEBEK: Why do you work in that hideous insurance office? -- dealing with people who fall off ladders. Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason. It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art. You could be -- a journalist.
KAFKA: That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
BIZZLEBEK: Success or nothing?
KAFKA: No -- not even success. My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living. Not for other people, it's for me.
