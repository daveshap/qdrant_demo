Political Diverisity in Student Affairs
Hey Folks,   I am currently in a PhD program and I am doing research on Political Diversity in Student Affairs.  There isn't a lot of research in the topic, so I am wondering if anyone would care to share their thoughts on the issue, ex. Is student affairs a liberal field?  Do non-liberals feel supported or they can share dissenting opinions? etc.   I am trying to get an idea of what the dominant norms are in the field other than my own perceptions.  I am also open to DM if any is not comfortable sharing their thoughts on the thread.  Also, your responses will not be quoted in my research, so no worries.
