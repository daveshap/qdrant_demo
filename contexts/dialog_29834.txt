JEFFREY: That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles. See, he definitely doesn't know me. Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
COLE: I'm here about some monkeys.
JEFFREY: Excuse me -- what did you say?
COLE: Monkeys. Twelve of them.
