Why am I always super depressed after having a fun day?
I don't have fun very often, but when I do, after it ends I end up getting super depressed and down afterwards. Even if it's something minor, like going to someone's house. Does anyone else experience this? What's the explanation?

Edit: the more fun the day, the more depressed I get. I'm not someone who's used to having fun or being happy so this is rare.
