BUD: Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
MRS. DREYFUSS: Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
BUD: Ma'am?
MRS. DREYFUSS: From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
BUD: I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
MRS. DREYFUSS: Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
BUD: Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
FRAN: My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
BUD: Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first. Just what are you going to tell her?
FRAN: Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
BUD: You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
FRAN: I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
BUD: Who?
FRAN: Someone from the office.
BUD: And where are you now?
FRAN: In his apartment.
BUD: His apartment?
FRAN: I mean -- her apartment.
BUD: What's your friend's name?
FRAN: Baxter.
BUD: What's her first name?
FRAN: Miss.
BUD: When are you coming home?
FRAN: As soon as I can walk.
BUD: Something wrong with your legs?
FRAN: No -- it's my stomach.
BUD: Your stomach?
FRAN: They had to pump it out.
BUD: Miss Kubelik, I don't think you ought to call anybody -- not till that chewing gum is out of your head.
FRAN: But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
BUD: That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
FRAN: Thanks for reminding me.
BUD: I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
FRAN: He doesn't give a damn about me.
BUD: Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
FRAN: He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
