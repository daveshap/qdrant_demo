Girlfriend/family buying a house, and its happening really quickly.
[Throwaway account]

Over the past two weeks my girlfriend and her mum have been looking at houses, and they put in an offer on one. I'd love to have a house together, but for a couple reasons its been really stressful. The decision happened really quickly and I feel like I wasn't part of the process - I hadn't even seen the place until after the offer was submitted. They're going to see a lawyer/bank in a couple days, which I only learned about yesterday and can't come to because its during work.

Basically the total down payment will be about 60%, from a small inheritance she has combined with money her family wants to put in. This leaves a 50K mortgage to be paid, which isn't much for a house, but under any other circumstances I don't know if we'd take that kind of debt. We're both working right now and I have ~8.5K in savings, but if one of us lost our jobs or if she went back to school (which she wants to), I honestly don't if we could pay the bills. I've only been working 4 months, myself.

I don't know, it feels weird how quickly its happening, and that I wasn't really part of the process. We never all (us and her parents) sat down to talk about how it'd work, ownership, responsibilities, etc... We're renting right now so I understand that its generally better to put that money into something you own, but it still just doesn't seem thought out. There are renovations that need to be done, and I have no idea what they'll cost or who's paying for them.

We talked about yesterday and she understands we're I'm coming from, but is obviously upset that I'm not all in - and honestly, how could I be? It's only been two weeks since I even heard about it, and we (or at least I) still don't know important basic information about it.
