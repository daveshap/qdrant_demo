Preparing for online graduate school
Hi y’all!
I’m super excited to start graduate school this fall, but by the looks of it, it appears my higher ed program will be online for the first semester. I’ll still have my assistantship/funding but I was wondering what to expect and how to prepare for classes being online. (Does it impact the camaraderie with the cohort, instructor, etc) 
I know that this is a long post, and I so appreciate the feedback!
