WOODY: It's not a laser! It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
HAMM: What's with him?
MR. POTATO HEAD: Laser-envy.
WOODY: All right, that's enough. Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
BUZZ: Toy?
WOODY: T-O-Y. Toy.
BUZZ: Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
WOODY: The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
MR. POTATO HEAD: Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
REX: Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear? Now I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do?
WOODY: He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
BUZZ: Excuse me.
HAMM: Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good!
WOODY: Oh, what?!...What?! These are plastic. He can't fly!
BUZZ: They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
WOODY: No, you can't.
BUZZ: Yes, I can.
WOODY: You can't!
BUZZ: Can!
WOODY: Can't! Can't! Can't!
BUZZ: I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
WOODY: Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer! Prove it.
BUZZ: All right, then, I will. Stand back everyone!
