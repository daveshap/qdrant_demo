Question about conferences and such
Hello, I'm currently finishing up my first year of graduate school and I'm working with a professor to submit some abstracts to conferences.

I'm in an interdiscplinary MA program focusing on communication.  Most of my graduate research is on cross-cultural comparison of media, social/new media, technology, etc. and my undergrad background is in History, so I think I would do better submitting to conferences related to those fields.

So far I've identified the MLA conferences: SAMLA, NEMLA, etc.  and have been looking out for CFPs for others.

My question is how do I know what makes a 'good' conference or one worth submitting to?  The MLA conferences seem like a good start, but I have no frame of reference since I've been out of school for a few years.

My advisor is somewhat helpful, but they are also fairly busy so I haven't been able to get a good answer on this question.

It would be good to get some conference experience on my CV.  I just want to make sure its legit.

Thanks for any advice!
