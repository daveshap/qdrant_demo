Is a history degree a possible way to enter the HR field?
Hello all, just looking for some honest advice! 

Currently I am pursuing a History and Social Science education degree and was planning to become a teacher until very recently when I was offered a HR type internship at a small corporation during the summer. I honestly don’t know a lot about the job itself but I am willing to learn as I go. 

My question is, do you think it’s realistic for someone like me to be able to enter the HR field with the degree I am currently working towards? I have taken economics, statistics and sociology and done good in those classes. Just bringing it up because I’ve heard that they are related. 

Thank you!
