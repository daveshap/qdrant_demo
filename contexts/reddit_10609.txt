Anyone else just living day by day, remembering nothing, thinking about nothing, enjoying very little, and being incredibly lonely, but almost as if it's sort of your own fault? Like you've done this to yourself?
I cannot verbally explain to anyone over a text, or a call, or by any other means how terrible I feel as of this moment. There are too many reasons and too many complicated situations that I would have to explain for anyone to even have the slightest idea of what kind of pain I'm in at this time. 

Maybe I'm being overbearing...

Its almost as if my chest is hurting? I forget everything? I have no drive? I'm going to grow up to be that old man who tells those kids to "chase their dreams or end up like me." 

Just kill me.
