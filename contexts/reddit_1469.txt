I envy my friends and others who don't suffer from mental illness / anxiety.
I am the only person I know of that suffers from extreme, crippling anxiety (thats why reddit makes me feel less alone). I feel a tinge of jealously when I see my friends able to just live life to the fullest without mental illness issues. And of course everyone has problems and I am in the midst of an anxiety crisis, so its making me feel extra weary. I just wish I could live my live without what feels like carrying an impossibly heavy load on my shoulders. 
I go to therapy twice a week and the medications Ive tried made me feel horrible. Sometimes this shit feels like a curse... I have beauty, intellect, drive and potential but I feel imprisoned by my anxiety when I go through these stressful times.
