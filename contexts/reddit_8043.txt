I enjoyed grad school but looking back I don’t know if it was a good return in investment. How to get over the regret
I decided to go to a top ranked program for a 1 year masters and didn’t think through better financial options-it was quite a bit, but at the time I felt tuition was worth it for the name and opportunities. And was it? I made incredible friends, took interesting classes, was exposed to interesting research and felt I was in a very stimulating environment and finally felt like I figured out what I really want to do with my career. 

However, now that I’m working I’m depressed and wondering if I made the wrong choice. My first job, I’m making less than the cost of the degree and worked a terrible job. In my second luckily I’ll be making >$20K the cost and hoping to continue working my way up. But I am quite stressed out and wondering if I made a good decision in hindsight. If I researched a bit more and picked a different program, maybe I wouldn’t have had to pay as much or even at all and might have still done this. 

I feel like continuous regrets keep popping up as I think about my overall choices with college and grad school trajectory. Does anybody else feel this way? How do you overcome the feeling?
