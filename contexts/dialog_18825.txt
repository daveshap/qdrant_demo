HARRY: Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
SHELLY: Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
HARRY: Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
SHELLY: I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
HARRY: After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
SHELLY: I'm sure she will.
