ALEX: Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
EM: Alex.
ALEX: Hullo love, how are you? Nice to see you, Dad.
PEE: Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
ALEX: Keeping fit then?
PEE: Fine, fine.
ALEX: Well, how are you then?
PEE: Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
ALEX: Well - I'm back.
PEE: Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
EM: Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?
ALEX: Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.
PEE: Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
EM: We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
PEE: Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
ALEX: That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
PEE: Aye.
ALEX: Well, still the same old place then, eh?
PEE: Oh, aye, aye.
ALEX: Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
PEE: Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
ALEX: How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?
