HAWKEYE: What for?
MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT: We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
HAWKEYE: Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT: C-A-M-E-M...?
HAWKEYE: B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
MEDICAL CORPS SERGEANT: Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
DUKE: I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
HAWKEYE: We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
DUKE: But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
HAWKEYE: Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
