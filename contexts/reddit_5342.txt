How can you stay at a boring, dead-end job, just because it pays well?
I've been in my job for almost two years and I'm pretty fed up with it. It has its perks:

* I never have to work over time, like EVER
* I don't work on weekends
* Boss is almost never around (it's been almost 3 months since she walked into the office)
* Human Resources is not too aware of the goings on of the people
* My salary is pretty good
* I can pretty much be on Reddit all day and do absolutely NOTHING and pretty much no one cares
* I've been using most of my time reading and learning new things (I'm currently learning a new language, the course is being paid with my own money that I get from my salary at this job)

Still even while having all this pros...I still feel like I want to just quit and find something else, even if its the complete opposite as long as I actually like what I do.

This is a very boring job. Pretty much everything I do seems to amount to nothing, I feel totally inconsequential. 

I've been going to therapy and been trying to figure out why I just can't be like most people who just stay in their job as long as it pays well. Most of my friends are like that. Some even hate their jobs to the point of going bald from stress but don't search for anything else because the money is too good. 

I just feel really guilty about not being productive, even though the job itself doesn't inspire me to be productive. 

I know that if it pays well enough I can use the time after work to get to do the things I like. I remind myself of this every day. But once I get into the office, sit at my desk and stare blankly at my screen...I just can't stand it.

My other problem is, I have absolutely no idea what I want to do besides this. What other job I would like to do that is probably going to be more demanding because that's the norm.
