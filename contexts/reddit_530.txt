I Need Opinions from High School Students! Do You Have 5 Minutes for a Quick Survey?
Hello All!

I work for a company called Phired Up Productions and our research department is looking for current high school students to lend us their opinions in a quick 5-minute online survey. Our company exists to help grow college organizations and we want to hear about how you view the college experience. 

We are giving out **thirty $50 Amazon gift cards** to a random selection of individuals who complete the survey.

To learn more and complete the survey, go here: www.surveymonkey.com/r/RedditHSStudy

If you have any questions, you are welcome to message me! 
Thanks for your help and have a great school year!
