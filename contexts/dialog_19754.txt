NIXON: Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over. These aren't fraternity pranks, John. It's anarchy. A revolution!
EHRLICHMAN: I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
NIXON: Why not?
EHRLICHMAN: Is the war worth it? Is it worth a one-term presidency? Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
NIXON: I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
KISSINGER: Exactly, sir. That is your historical contribution: to lead boldly in an era of limits.
NIXON: No one understands! -- even my own men. What do you think the Communists respond to? Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying? Hell no! I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years. They grasp realpolitik" better than any of us
NIXON: We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything! I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset. That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing. I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
ZIEGLER: What? Win Vietnam, sir?
