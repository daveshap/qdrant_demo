GARY: Milo. What's up?
MILO: Well -- you sent for me.
GARY: Right... Right.
MILO: You really wrote this just today?
GARY: What're you implying.
MILO: Nothing!
GARY: Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid. I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
MILO: I'm sure.
GARY: The purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. But the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. Being obsessive isn't a crime. It's a character trait.
GARY: It scales, don't you think?
MILO: Definitely.
