LYSSA: I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
COLWYN: Never mind my ears! Go away!
TUROLD: A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
QUEEN: A match for your son, I think.
TUROLD: A fine match.
QUEEN: They will have the life that you and I might have had.
LYSSA: There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
COLWYN: Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
LYSSA: I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
COLWYN: Thank you, but I can wait.
LYSSA: I can't.
COLWYN: I lied.
LYSSA: About what?
COLWYN: I can't wait either.
TUROLD: You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
COLWYN: It was a platonic kiss, Father.
TUROLD: Of course it was.
