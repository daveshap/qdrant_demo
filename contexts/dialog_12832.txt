HILDY: Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
BURNS: What did you do with her?
HILDY: What happened?
BURNS: You been in a fight?
LOUIE: Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
BURNS: Take that mush out of your mouth!
HILDY: Where's the old lady?
LOUIE: I'm telling you!
LOUIE: We run smack into a police patrol. You know what I mean? We broke it in half!
HILDY: Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
BURNS: Where is she? Tell me!
HILDY: Louie!
LOUIE: I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
HILDY: What did you do with her?
LOUIE: Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
HILDY: -- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
LOUIE: Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
BURNS: Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
LOUIE: What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
BURNS: Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
LOUIE: I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
HILDY: Don't tell me -- was she killed?
BURNS: Was she? Did you notice?
