RUDE BOSS: He's a <u>bum</u>.
ED: No he's not! Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years? Dracula"! "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!"
RUDE BOSS: Yeah? Well now he's a junkie. He don't deserve to work.
ED: That's not true --
RUDE BOSS: He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
ED: Well, uh, if I could I would...
ED: Ugh! I hate the way she interrupts the pictures. She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
BELA: I think she's a honey. Look at those jugs.
BELA: Vampira! You will come under my spell! You will be my slave of love.
ED: Hey Bela, how do you do that?
BELA: You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian. Vampira, look at me! Stare into my eyes.
BELA: I am getting tired. I need to take my medicine.
ED: Do you want me to get it for you?
BELA: No thank you, Eddie. I'll be alright.
