Women, how do you feel about dating a working class man in a skilled trade rather than a professional?
I have a bachelor's degree, but I've found it to be not worth the paper it was written on. I tried to self learn coding, but it's very difficult to get a job that way it seems. I've spent years trying to get some sort of professional job, in part because I feel like professional jobs just have more social cachet and there is a stigma associated with working class jobs, even though many of them actually pay better than lower end white collar jobs. (and I think there are factual data points that back this up)

Anyways now that I've accepted my station as working class I've started an apprenticeship program and I should be making pretty solid money in a few months, maybe someday own my own company.
