You are more than your credit score.
I’ve paid a few very old debts in recent days. My unemployment was delayed ten weeks and when it finally came through it was literally more money than I had ever had at my disposal in my entire life. I don’t think most people would consider the amount of money I received to be \*that\* much money. But it shook me a little.

Suddenly, with the snap of the government’s fingers, I was able to make a twelve year old debt disappear so I could get the piece of paper that proves I did in fact earn the bachelors degree I should have gotten when my now teenage son was a toddler.

Suddenly, I was able to repay two months’ rent on an empty apartment to the predatory property management company Premier. A company who makes a fucking killing exploiting tax breaks for providing “low income housing” that is substandard and still far too expensive for many of its residents. A company that regularly overworks and undertrains it’s property managers so empty apartments sit open and they get to extract profit from the most vulnerable in our communities instead of paying their workers to do the job needed swiftly and fill the damn apartment.

Suddenly I had the back up I needed to look at my credit report and call about an unknown $644 medical debt. To call my health insurance and see if they could help bring that down. To navigate the fucking labyrinth of people I needed to tell my story to in order to get the basic fucking information about how this debt was created.

Guys. I am EXHAUSTED.

I know that it’s controversial to say that when Black and POC folks are being literally fucking trampled. I’m not looking for sympathy. I will be ok. I just had to fucking write something just in case any of you find yourselves, like I did yesterday, just fucking drained after a day of phone calls that felt like whack-a-mole. I couldn’t figure out why I felt like I’d just been put through the fucking wringer but I think I know now.

Doing the work to repair one’s credit can be painful and difficult. It can be so hard that it is re-traumatizing. Living in poverty is trauma. Dealing with institutions that systematically make you feel less than and actively separate you from the resources you need to survive and thrive is traumatic.

A LOT of people are struggling financially because of the pandemic, but some of us have suddenly gotten enough money to make a dent in what was previously a hopeless cause — our financial well being. It was something so profoundly out of reach that we simply put it out of our minds. No amount of budgeting or sacrificing or side hustling was going to make the money we needed appear because that’s not how poverty works. You are so deep in the hole that getting out of the hole isnt even a coherent thought that makes sense. You’re just trying to keep the dirt from completely enveloping you. You’re just trying to keep breathing.

PLEASE — my internet stranger friends who are doing the hard work of requesting your credit report, of calling these collection agencies, of remembering the circumstances around why you couldn’t pay, of re-living the shame around not having enough money to protect your future self from debt — UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUCTURES IN PLACE TO KEEP POOR FOLKS DOWN ARE MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN A LIFETIME OF MISTAKES ANY ONE PERSON CAN MAKE.

There is nothing wrong with YOU because you do not have enough money to provide for yourself, your family, and keep some aside for emergencies.

I of course understand that there are exceptions — some people do squander their resources. But the vast majority of us poor folk try incredibly hard to live on an absolutely TINY amount of money. We sacrifice everything we can and then go deeper and sacrifice things we can’t. We have learned to put a wall between our own sweet, vulnerable selves and the SHAME of not being able to pay an important bill. We forget about it because we HAVE TO. We throw away the multi-colored 2nd and 3rd and 4th notices because we have NO OTHER CHOICE. We hang up on bill collectors because we literally do not have $10/month with which to bargain.

If you find yourself suddenly in a position to do the hard work of paying these companies that have fucked you over, or overcharged you, or that you don’t even fucking remember why you owe them money any more, and you find yourself overwhelmed, or anxious or confused and you can’t quite understand why you’re having such a large reaction to “just” paying a bill... I beg you, be gentle with yourself. Being poor is scary. It is stressful and painful and difficult. You are strong and brave and WORTHY of having ENOUGH.

We are not here on this planet to feel BAD about circumstances beyond our control. Pay those debts, and hold yourself gently while you do it. Take a day off between debts. Allow yourself time to decompress and grieve for an economic and legal structure that incentivizes those with money and penalizes those without. You didn’t create it and it’s not your fault that you are at its mercy. I see you. I’m here. If you need support, please reach out. You are more than your fucking credit score.
