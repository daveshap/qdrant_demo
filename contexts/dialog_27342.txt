MACKENZIE: I know you need one when it's really cold.
STARKS: [Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
MACKENZIE: Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
STARKS: [Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
MACKENZIE: [Beat] How do you know?
STARKS: The Jacket.
MACKENZIE: Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
STARKS: No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
