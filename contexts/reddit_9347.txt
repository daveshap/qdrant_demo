I just found out $14k of my medical bills have been erased
I had two hospital stays last year totaling 6 days that I later, in December, received the bills for. I had an actual panic attack when I opened them and saw balances that totaled $14k and change. It made no sense because I’m fully insured with Highmark BCBS, the best high premium plan that my company offers, as I have a chronic illness. I basically had a breakdown and realized that the next 3 years of my income were a wash, and my plans to build a savings were over.

I’ve been calling Blue Cross, the hospital billing departments, over and over for 3 months. I had to comb over the Explanation of Benefits and coding on each charge. I asked BCBS to reprocess each, called the providers to confirm their coding was correct. I had to write and send two letters USPS for appeals.  On Friday, the billing department at one told me, like no big deal, “Oh yeah, you don’t owe anything. Blue Cross didn’t accept the coding. We sent your bills to local when they should have gone to your out of state insurance. They reprocessed, and you’re all set.” No notification from insurance, no letters in the mail yet. 

I still have to call the other hospital and confirm that they’ also have a 0 balance. But finally, after months of stress and trying to make a second job work, I can stop worrying and get back to my financial plan.

Always check your medical bills, question them, and don’t be afraid to be aggressive.
