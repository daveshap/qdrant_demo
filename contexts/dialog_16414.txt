QUAID: My God.
HARRY: What?
QUAID: You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
HARRY: Yeah. You could say that.
QUAID: You're drawn to the dark side, over and over. And it's drawn to you. You don't like that.
HARRY: Not much.
QUAID: You can't change it. You have to walk... ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell. It's your destiny. Accept it.
HARRY: Hold on.
QUAID: I'm not afraid to die. There's something terrible... coming home...
HARRY: The Puritan?
QUAID: Yes...
HARRY: Who is he?
