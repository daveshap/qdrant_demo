Should I drop out of college and get into a trade? Scared of facing homelessness and extreme poverty as a student
I turn 21 soon. At a local community college that does not have dorms. I'll be halfway done with an associates degree after this semester. 

I won't be able to live at my moms house anymore soon, hopefully this happens after semester ends. I definitely can not afford a place with my current part-time job and even with a roommate (which i'm looking into!) I still don't think I would be able to afford much more than rent. And I realize that not being able to afford all basic needs is going to have an impact on school.

I'm considering dropping out of college and starting an electricians apprenticeship. I will be paid a living wage, full-time job with on the job training. I'm told there's good money in it after a while. I'll actually be able to afford rent, food, bills, gasoline, and a safe place to live for the next couple years while I'm working. I'm going to get a room mate soon any way. 

I'm scared of the student loans I will have to take on if I continue with school.

I'm thinking maybe I can be farther ahead by the time I finish the apprenticeship vs by the time I finish my bachelors and try to find a job. 

I'm scared and don't know what to do. I know for a fact that if I stay in school full-time I will be in extreme poverty by January and will stay there for the next several years.
