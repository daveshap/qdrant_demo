BABY SITTER: This is Doyle's house.
JEFF: This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
BABY SITTER: This is the baby sitter.
JEFF: Oh. When are they expected home?
BABY SITTER: I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
JEFF: Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
BABY SITTER: Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
JEFF: He has it. Thank you.
BABY SITTER: Goodnight.
