describe to me, what does it feel like to sleep next to someone you love?
I love reading people’s feelings towards the ones they love and I’ve been meaning to ask this question for a while so please tell me your stories, I’d love to read them all, it’s so cute. 

(I get really lonely at night so I wanna know what does it feel like to sleep with someone you love other than your dog) haha

Edit: I DID NOT expect to get this many comments but one thing I will say is that I LOVE every single one of you guys’ stories. I keep reading them over and over again. You all just gave me faith in humanity, knowing you appreciate small moments like these is just amazing.
