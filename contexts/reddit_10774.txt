Killing myself is a PERMANENT solution to a PERMANENT problem. Depression is a lifelong illness that cannot be cured, it can only be suppressed and treated.
I hate everything. I don't enjoy anything, I hate life, I hate my family. I have nothing I am good at or enjoy. No reason to live. nothing to strive for. Nothing to gain. I don't have any reason to live.

I don't love anything or anyone enough to stay. I just want to die and see what happens afterward, I have no obligation to live this life fully. And if there is nothing after death then that's great.

I have no goals for this life. At least my death will be a step in the right direction. Nobody will have to deal with me ever again.
