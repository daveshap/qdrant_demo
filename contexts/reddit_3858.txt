This guy is keeping me on the hook until something better comes along and it sucks
I met this guy on Tinder over the holiday break. We have a lot of common interests and there was a connection straight away, and we have messaged every day since. We had our first date a couple of weeks ago, a week after matching. We talked a lot, we kissed, it felt like I'd finally found my match. But I've noticed over the last week or two his conversation frequency has massively dropped off - it used to be we'd be talking constantly from start to end of the day. He'd check in with me and ask about my day. Now it feels it's a chore for him to talk to me at all.

I've asked him about it and he says he's still interested, he just doesn't have a lot of time to throw my way. But that sounds like bullshit, right? His time now really shouldn't be that different to when we first matched, so why is there a problem now compared to when we first met? I get that conversations die off a little after a while but to not even ask how I'm doing now and then? Ugh.

Also, there's no sign on the horizon of a second date. I've tried suggesting meets but each time he's had to cancel for one reason or another. And every time I try to bring up the what's going on conversation, he says he's still interested and we'll do [insert amazing plans here] next time we go out without ever actually planning said second amazing date.

Aaaaaand now that I've typed all this out, it seems crystal clear I'm in limbo. Anyone know how to self-resuscitate, or gracefully pass on to the other side? Have you ever been in the same situation before? What would you do?

Update: I ended it. A lot of you recommended just taking the high road and walking away, but I felt like I'd just be waiting for him to message me if I just pulled back.

I need ice cream. And shoe shopping.
