CONWAY: Charming chap.
BARNARD: Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
CONWAY: Well, that's that, I guess.
BARNARD: Wonder what's happened to Fenner.
LOVETT: Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
BARNARD: Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
CONWAY: No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
LOVETT: Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
CONWAY: That fellow got on at Baskul.
LOVETT: What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
CONWAY: George, what are you going to do?
GEORGE: I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
LOVETT: Good.
CONWAY: What if he refuses?
LOVETT: We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
CONWAY: Brilliant! Can anyone here fly a plane?
