GUS: Sonofagun! Look at this here!
FRED: First paycheck?
GUS: First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80! Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
FRED: That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
GUS: I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
FRED: Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent. There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
GUS: What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach? Everybody loses them fractions?
FRED: They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
GUS: Who gets it, the company?
FRED: No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
GUS: So where is all them half-centses?
FRED: They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
FRED: How many sugars?
GUS: One. And a half.
