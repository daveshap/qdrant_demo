CHRISTINE: What did you say?
NICHOLAS: I didn't say anything.
CHRISTINE: My name's not Christine. It's not my real...
NICHOLAS: Who the fuck cares?
CHRISTINE: It's just money. You should be glad you're alive.
NICHOLAS: It might be best if we didn't talk.
CHRISTINE: All I mean is... someone like you...
NICHOLAS: How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
CHRISTINE: What?
NICHOLAS: Scams, con games. How many?
CHRISTINE: I don't know. A lot.
NICHOLAS: Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me. Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million. You ruined people's lives.
