my asian parents: you don't need safeties!
so i'm an international and i originally had a list of 12 schools i wanted to apply to, but my parents had a look at the list and were like "you're too good for johns hopkins and carnegie mellon" and i was like "excuse me, do you know that they have literally the bEsT courses in the world?" and they were like "just go to yale"

just go to yale.

oml lmao.

so i had to shave like half of the schools off my list and now i'm only allowed to apply to, like, t5s in the states.

i do have a safety though, it's the school in my city, but it's almost a "if you go to that school you're disowned" kind of safety.
