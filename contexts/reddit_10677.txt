My only motivation to live is my dog.
These days I feel like I am tired of everything - work, friends, family, life itself. I'm only hanging on for my dog [3 Y/O], because I've learned that dogs don't understand the concept of death. I'm not depressed, I'm just tired of everything (unless they're the same?) There are days when I feel like I can really pass away already, but there are still days when I want to live. I just don't know how to or why else should I continue anymore. 

I can only hope my dog would live a healthy happy long life, and I want to make sure I'm by his side.
