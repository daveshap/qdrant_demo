Can visible light be composed of invisible electromagnetic frequencies? I know that when we see red light (via electromagnetic frequencies in the red range) and blue light (via electromagnetic frequencies in the blue range)  at the same time, we perceive it as magenta light.Is it possible for non visible electromagnetic frequencies (such as ultraviolet and infrared) to combine in a way that makes us see it as a visible light?
