I keep hearing people ask why nobody is in jail over the financial crisis. Who (names, not companies) should be arrested and what crime did they commit?
They certainly took risks that they shouldn't have with their companies investment portfolios, and they clearly charge customers for "services" that they shouldn't, but what law was broken? Now, I know about Standard & Poor giving ratings to mortgage bonds that they didn't deserve, but it seems to me that an investigation that large would cost so much money, we'd have to raise taxes just to afford the man hours. At that point, enforcing what rules they may have broken is no different than the war on drugs/piracy. Thoughts?
