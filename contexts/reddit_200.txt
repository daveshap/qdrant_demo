Need help with friends
I have a small circle of real friends that I would ask to hangout but I never really keep in contact with. During the school year a lot of people said they wanted to hangout in summer but nothing at all came up and its not even a month until school starts again. I text people sometimes but never really hangout with them and as far as I know I'm not hated or anything. Even my best friend I haven't heard from in week until yesterday I found out he is taking UFC classes and learning Italian and Portuguese we never talked about any of that before. And even my girlfriend and I don't talk much. I feel like no one cares about me anymore maybe I am alone?
