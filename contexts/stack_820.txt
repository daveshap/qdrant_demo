Is there a specific format a USB needs to be to boot from? Does the USB I'm booting from need a specific format to work?I have a USB stick capable of being formatted to FAT32, NTFS and one or two more different formats. If I download the latest Ubuntu onto my computer and put it on the USB, does it matter if the USB is formatted to NTFS? I ask this because FAT32 can't hold the full file size.I'm doing this to recover my Root Password in order to update my PC.
