RAE: LET ME GO!
LAZARUS: You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will. Right or wrong, you gonna mind me. Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
LAZARUS: Now you get up! And you get in my house!
RAE: Or what?
RAE: Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
LAZARUS: Whose doin' is that?
