PATRIZIA: Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
RAIMONDO: If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
PATRIZIA: Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
CLAUDIA: I would say he's pretty depraved.
PATRIZIA: Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
RAIMONDO: Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
PATRIZIA: You know, I don't love anybody.
RAIMONDO: I know, dammit, I know! And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
PATRIZIA: He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
CLAUDIA: One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
PATRIZIA: Have you ever been in love?
CLAUDIA: Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
