Job at a firm vs family startup
So here's the situation I am in - graduating end of this year and have a position lined up at a pretty decent firm.

On the other hand, my dad is ready to start his own business. He has a strong 30+ years of experience working in this industry and for the past 10 has been the CEO at a pretty big firm. He wants to do his own thing as he nears retirement and wants me to join in. 

This has been an extremely difficult decision to make. If I do join the startup then I feel I would have missed out on the traditional route of graduating and working at a proper firm with a stable salary and a proper learning framework. But I also feel that if I were to join the startup later, I will miss out on the exciting bits of starting something from scratch which carries a lot of learning with it. I would be grateful if someone could offer a different perspective or advice. Cheers
