What are the obstacles to the GOP passing tax reform this year, if any? Are their proposals likely to pass through Congress?
Healthcare reform looks to be dead within this reconciliation window, if not within this session of Congress entirely. Republicans are looking towards tax reform for their first big legislative victory and the issue is surely less contentious among its members.


Are there any noteworthy obstacles to them reaching the 50 votes (plus Pence) necessary to pass a piece of legislation through the Senate? It's my understanding that because reducing revenues ceteris paribus increases the deficit, [tax reform was largely predicated on the savings that were to be generated from cuts to the ACA](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/342315-gop-rep-tax-reform-will-not-happen-without-healthcare-reform). Where do the revenues come from now? 


Are their substantial ideological divisions that would otherwise throw a wrench in the works?
