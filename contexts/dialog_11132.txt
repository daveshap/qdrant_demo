WHALE: Did you kill anyone?
CLAY: I don't like to talk about that.
WHALE: It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
CLAY: Proud? Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
WHALE: Quite true. Hand-to-hand combat is the true test. Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
CLAY: No. I could have, though.
WHALE: Yes, I believe you could. How free is your schedule this afternoon?
CLAY: Full up. I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
WHALE: What is we say phooey to the hedges? Could you spare an hour after lunch? To sit for me?
CLAY: Can't today.
WHALE: I'll pay our going rate. Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
CLAY: Sorry. I don't feel like sitting still today.
WHALE: All righty. I understand.
