Am I making things more difficult for myself by only wanting sex while in a relationship?
So I am fairly new to dating and need some guidance. I have recently graduated college and now that I am out on my own, I have been putting myself out there more and more. I never really had the chance to date while in college so I am having to play catch up which is fine, but my inexperience in and of itself does make things a little difficult. While I have been meeting a lot of really awesome people, I always get kind of stuck when sex becomes a possibility. I never participated in hookup culture while in college because I never really liked the idea of just sleeping with someone without fully trusting them or at least knowing them a fair bit. Will this make things more difficult for me or will it just mean I have to tweak my approach?
