ELIZABETH: This is Betty at twelve.
CHARLIE: Very graceful. Perfect form.
ELIZABETH: Betty was a lovely child.
JERROLD: And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
WESLEY: Would you say she was ambitious?
JERROLD: Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
CHARLIE: Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too. Very, very impressive...
WESLEY: Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
ELIZABETH: I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
CHARLIE: What do you mean?
ELIZABETH: If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
CHARLIE: Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
JERROLD: You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
WESLEY: ...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
JERROLD: Because it ain't natural, young man.
WESLEY: What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
