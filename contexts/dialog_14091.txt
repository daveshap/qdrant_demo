MISS WOLLSTEN: I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours —— but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
CATHY: Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
MISS WOLLSTEN: You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
CATHY: Really, this is idiotic!
MISS WOLLSTEN: You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
