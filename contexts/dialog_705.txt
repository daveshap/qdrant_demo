IRAQI SOLDIER: The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
CERALLOS: Did we warn them off?
IRAQI SOLDIER: Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
CERALLOS: It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
IRAQI SOLDIER: They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
CERALLOS: The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
IRAQI SOLDIER: The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
CERALLOS: Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
