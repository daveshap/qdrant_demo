VERONICA: You had to tell him.
DANTE: I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
VERONICA: What did he say?
DANTE: At least he wasn't thirty-six.
VERONICA: And that made you feel better?
DANTE: And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
VERONICA: The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
DANTE: ...it isn't there. Yes.
VERONICA: Thank you for being rational.
DANTE: Thank you for the lasagne.
VERONICA: You couldn't get these shutters open?
DANTE: I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
VERONICA: Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
DANTE: What time do you get finished?
VERONICA: Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
DANTE: Sure.
VERONICA: Good. I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
RANDAL: All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
CUSTOMER: This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
RANDAL: Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right?
DANTE: Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
RANDAL: Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
DANTE: The best Burtless movie ever made.
CUSTOMER: Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
RANDAL: Lenin's Tomb.
