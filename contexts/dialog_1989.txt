NEFF: Why the smirk?
KENAI: Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in. Maybe more for lettin' him loose. I was up in my cache. Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
NEFF: You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
KENAI: Corbett coming here stinks of trouble. We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
NEFF: Stay out of it.
CORBETT: Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
ERIC: You broke the radio, remember?
CORBETT: I'm sure she's fine. Seemed like a clever kid.
CORBETT: You were real resourceful out there. Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter. So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones. Gets along better than ever. Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
ERIC: I liked you better frozen. You didn't talk so much.
CORBETT: You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good. You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of. That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.
CORBETT: Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you. That's what you want out of this, isn't it?
