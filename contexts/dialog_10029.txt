JOHN: I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970. Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
SATCH: So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street. Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
JOHN: Not the first time that's been true. I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy. This is the guy, Satch.
SATCH: Uh, huh.
JOHN: What?
SATCH: I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
DARYL: That was over thirty years ago. I paid for that and then some.
JOHN: You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
DARYL: Yeah.
JOHN: You remember Mary Finelli?
DARYL: What are you saying?
JOHN: You know what I'm saying.
DARYL: No, I don't.
JOHN: Well, I think you do.
