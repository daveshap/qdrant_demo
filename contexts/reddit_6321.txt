Hiree Signed Employment Contract For Later Start Date, But Decided To Change Mind. Enforceable?
we found someone we'd want to employ. both parties executed the employment contract agreement. Feb is executed contract date, with effective start date March 1. hiree needed time to relocate so we gave him 2 weeks to settle. 2 weeks later he decided to change his mind. on a legal standpoint, can we do anything about this?
