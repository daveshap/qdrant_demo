My boyfriend's X-Mas Vacation is more than I can afford.
My boyfriend and his family have gone on a 2 week long ski trip every year for 15 years. This will be our 3rd Christmas together and I can no longer put off going with them. His mother bought a season pass for me without telling me last Feb. In my mind this meant it was a gift, she asked me last month to pay her back. Its a $300 pass and I did not have the funds so my bf graciously offered to pay it as a Christmas gift. Now I don't have a snowboard(I cant ski) or boots and I stupidly assumed that rentals were included in my package because it was a high price for an early season pass. Now Im faced with having to pay for rentals but at the price I may as well buy my own bored. I just don't have the money for this trip, and Im taking 2 weeks off work. My bfs family do not seem to care. They don't seem to realize that I just don't have the money for this on hand. Had I known about the amount of money needed for this trip I could have saved over the year. But they would not give me any info, when I asked questions their response was "don't worry about it, everything will be fine." Im so pissed at this situation.
