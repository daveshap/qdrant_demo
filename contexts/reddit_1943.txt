After three tries, I got into Oxford
Two years ago, I applied to Oxford. I got rejected.

Last year, I applied again. I got rejected again. I also applied to a bunch of Ivy League schools and the T20’s. I even did a livestream and advertised it on r/A2C. I got rejected from literally every single school. There were tears and trust me, it was really really difficult,

Now, with 25+ rejection letters, I got into Oxford.  All throughout this journey, I battled depression, a dysfunctional family situation, and my father’s company filed bankruptcy. 

It was a shitstorm and all throughout, r/A2C was there. Y’all are so supportive and helpful, I really don’t know what I would have done without this sub.

Thank you so much. If anyone has questions about applying to the UK (or Oxford for that matter), feel free to ask :)
