DR. ROYCE: I know what you're getting at.
MAURICE: You do?
DR. ROYCE: I've seen it before.
MAURICE: You have?
DR. ROYCE: You're feeling old and you want to start exercising. A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth. Don't feel embarrassed about it.
MAURICE: Okay.
DR. ROYCE: You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
MAURICE: No. How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
MAURICE: Just for curiosity sake that's all?
DR. ROYCE: I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
MAURICE: Twenty miles? I see.
JOSELLE: Each inch represents 150 miles...
MAURICE: Making the grand total?
JOSELLE: Damn baby, relax. I'm getting to it. From Philadelphia following the route highlighted to Pacifica California -- you're traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles...
MAURICE: Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
JOSELLE: What was that?
MAURICE: Perhaps there's another route?
JOSELLE: This is the route approved by triple A. Even if you followed back roads the entire way, you'd still be looking at roughly the same distance...
JOSELLE: Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
MAURICE: By car right?
