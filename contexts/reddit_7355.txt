Was told I was getting a raise. 4 pay periods later I still haven't seen it. Not sure how to proceed.
I work in a hotel as a sales manager. I've been at my current property a little over a year. When I was hired I had no sales experience but over the course of the year I have met and sometimes exceeded my sales goals.

I was desperate to get out of my old job so I accepted an offer with a slightly lower base salary then people in the same position in my area. I gave myself a year and if I was doing well in the position I was going to ask to be compensated. I did research before my review and saw that the sales manager at the hotel listed directly below us in tripadvisor rankings was making $3000 more than me. I took this information into my review and stated my case. I was told that not everyone was getting raises this year but I had definitely proven myself and my GM told me that I would be getting one. I asked for a specific amount and he said he would have to discuss that with his bosses.

I waited 2 pay periods to see it on my check and there was nothing. I asked my GM and he gave me some excuse but assured me that while it would not be on the next check it would be on the one after. Said check came on Friday and there was nothing. I am not sure how to proceed today. I feel like I am being taken advantage of because I haven't raised much of a stink.

On a side note, getting my bonuses has been a pain in the neck as well. I have to continually pester and ask and they come months after the fact, so much so that I have lost track of which months I have been compensated for.

Any advice would be appreciated.
