Photoluminescence Spectroscopy- Two individual spots, different colors, but same emission spectra my apologies in advance if I'm not posting at the right site, but StackExchange-Physics is the closest one that relates to this question.Method: Photoluminescence spectroscopySample being studied: a mm-size crystal with rough surface, and unequal heightWhat's confusing me: On the same crystal, a spot that emits purple light and another spot that emits blue light have the same PL spectra. Why?Here're my guesses and I was hoping someone could suggest other/a more concrete causes with reference.Guess 1. [Premise: the purple spot has a much brighter PL intensity than the blue spot] The blue and the purple spots have different emission spectra, and the blue area has some faint purple emission that's unnoticeable by eye, but since the purple emission lot more intense than the blue emission, the spectrum for the blue spot is shadowed by that of the purple spot, so for each spot I see the same spectrum.Guess 2. Blue and the purple spots are exactly the same so they should have the same spectrum, but since the crystal has an uneven surface some of the blue/purple light gets scattered, resulting in a different color than what's originally emitting.Thanks!
