Did I get rejected? If not should I wait?
I went through 4 rounds of interviews with this Japanese IT firm for a sales role. During my last round of interview last week, the managing director told me that he is making a trip to japan to confirm with the HQ before he can confirm my hire.

Today he tells my recruiter, because of the caronavirus situation in Japan, the HQ in Japan is freezing the hiring process until June. My recruiter says, if i am still available and interested in June, she will push my profile to this company again.

I have a job now but I absolutely hate my job. I asked the recruiter, if they liked me as a candidate... she said that I was the only candidate to make it all the way to the last round and they were very serious about hiring me.

I really wanted this job but i am not sure to make of this scenario. I am very disappointed.
