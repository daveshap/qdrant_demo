Led blinking with one NPN transistor I am using scheme as shown below to blink an LED. But I'm using 9V battery source instead of 12V.I tried to use capacitors in range 100uF - 500uF to increase delay between blinks.Questions:When I tried put there 1000uF capacitor, there is no more blinking effect. LED is OFF. Why?When I put there 500uF capacitor, I thought the LED will blink with 0.5s interval as 10K * 500uF should be Tau = 0.5s.Actualy I see it blinking with interval 0.25s.
