I have a 24vac input, and want to use a NO relay so an arduino knows when the relay is closed I had thought I could just connect the 24vac input to a relay input, and then setup a pin as an input on the arduino and be able to know that the relay had closed.  But now I'm reading that relays need a minimum current or some such, and I don't really understand how I could meet that since I'll have no load.I know just barely enough to even be dangerous.  Am I even making sense?
