DAVID: ...I think rust.
MEGAN: Rust?
DAVID: As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
MEGAN: I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
DAVID: My turn. What's your favorite song?
MEGAN: Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
DAVID: What was that?
MEGAN: We're supposed to be honest.
DAVID: Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
MEGAN: My turn. When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
