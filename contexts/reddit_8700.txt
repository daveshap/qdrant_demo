What are the implications of the U.S. choice not to veto the U.N. Security Council resolution to call for an end to Israeli settlements on the West Bank?
[This bbc.com article]( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-38421026?ns_mchannel=social&ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&ns_source=twitter&ns_linkname=news_central) states that the U.N. Security Council has passed a resolution against Israeli settlements along the West Bank, and the U.S. has chosen not to veto it, unlike the past. Does Israel have to comply? What measures are in place to ensure that they do? 

Obviously I'm not looking for guess work here, I just want to know what concrete elements of international government are in place to manage this sort of thing and what consequences the various decisions that all of the players could make would bring.

It would also be cool to read about the history of the relationships between the parties involved in a clear and concise manner, but that'd simply be the cherry on top.

Shout out to u/nosecohn for helping me edit my post to comply with this subs standards for submission.

Thanks!
