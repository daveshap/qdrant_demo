STU: <u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
MONKEYBONE: I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
STU: Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
MONKEYBONE: Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
STU: I am not. And I don't gotta.
MONKEYBONE: You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
STU: Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
