"I don't date men with receding hairlines."
[26/m] I was told this tonight by someone to whom I had grown close. I told her how I felt, and this was the response I got.

Spare me the "she isn't the kind of woman you want" or "not every woman is that way" etc. I've heard it before. I know. 

I'm just venting the pain of having one of my greatest insecurities externally validated. Wow this hurts.

EDIT: Thank you everyone who have given me words of encouragement and advice. For the record, I buzz my head down to 1/4" regularly, am involved in cross-fit, and make an effort to look nice most days.

I am always looking for ways to improve myself though so your tips are welcome and appreciated.
