Why does everyone think therapy is some miracle cure???
CBT is literally a psychologist or psychiatrist or therapist or fucking whatever telling you things you already damn know and don’t have the motivation or energy to execute. “Think positive”, “focus on breathing”, “exercise”, “find time to do things you enjoy”. I could pull this shit out of my ass. I fucking hate it when people tell me to “get help”. There is no fucking help. Only I can help myself, and I can’t.


Edit: The comments saying you only get what you put in, I’m done, I have nothing to put in. That’s KINDA what depression does
