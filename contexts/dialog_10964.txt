GRACCHUS: Who are you? Narcissus The Good? I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
NARCISSUS: You're hearing about somebody else.
GRACCHUS: How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
NARCISSUS: When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
GRACCHUS: Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial? You'd have to give me your word.
NARCISSUS: I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
GRACCHUS: You're a citizen and a soldier. Not a gladiator.
NARCISSUS: You don't know how wrong you are.
