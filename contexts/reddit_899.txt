Does anyone else get "pee anxiety"? Like, when you know you won't be able to use a restroom for a few hours, you get really anxious about it and end up thinking about needing it the whole time?
Most of the time happens on longer trips or exams. It also usually ends in actually having to pee cause I couldn't get it out of my mind.
