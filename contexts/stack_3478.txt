Does ARP spoofing works in case the target ARP cache has the gateway I am trying to create a script that will do a basic ARP spoofing attack (I choose this StackExchange website because the question is more about the theoretical side), and I see no reference to the attack in case the computer already has the gateway IP in its cache (and the same for the target's IP in the gateway cache).As I see it, the computer most of the time should have the gateway in its cache, and therefore an attack will be possible only if one can predict when the ARP table gets reset automatically or can answer before the gateway.I would like to understand which ARP replay should he save and which he should discard; and whether there is a way to use the attack even if the gateway IP is in the target's cache.
