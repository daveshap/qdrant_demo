PAUL: Ah, coffee. Smells good.
RASHID: One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
PAUL: Thanks.
RASHID: What time did you get to bed last night?
PAUL: I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
RASHID: You work too hard, you know that?
PAUL: Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go. Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
RASHID: Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
PAUL: If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
RASHID: That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too. So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
PAUL: If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
RASHID: Come on, just a little hint.
PAUL: Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
RASHID: The inspiration.
PAUL: Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
RASHID: No way.
PAUL: All right. Listen carefully. About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
RASHID: The end.
PAUL: No, not the end. The beginning. His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
