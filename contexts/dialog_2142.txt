CHRIS: I'm an idiot?
DOUG: Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
CHRIS: Really, The Freeman Centre"?"
DOUG: No....The Asylum!
CHRIS: Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
DOUG: None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
CHRIS: I've been saying that since we met.
DOUG: Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
