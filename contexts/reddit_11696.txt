My Dad is making me feel guilty because I'm mad at him
I was at dinner with my parents last night, and we were discussing colleges and which school I thought was best for me. I said something like, "This school is closest, but it doesn't offer the major I'm looking for."  My Dad looked confused and asked, "Now, just what major *are* you looking for?"
Um, what? I have discussed what I want to do after college countless times with my folks for years, and now he can't remember what it is? Without trying to sound too angry, I said, "Psychology!" (I don't want to major in psych but i'm saying that for the sake of the story). 
He pinched his eyebrows together and asked, "Okay...psychology--------" as if there were a second part to psychology, like psychology humanities or some shit. What the hell?
He always does shit like this, and it pisses me off. I'm not afraid to say I was fairly quiet the rest of dinner. I wasn't giving him the silent treatment like a five year old, but yeah, I was pissed.
Now when he sees me or talks to me it's like he has a dark cloud over his head. He only responds to anything with, "yeah...," or "Guess so..."
I want to rip him a new one. I've always had a problem with my anger, but he always victimizes himself.
