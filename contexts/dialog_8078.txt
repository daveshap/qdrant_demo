CARR: It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
TREVES: Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
CARR: I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
