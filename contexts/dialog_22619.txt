CAPTAIN DIEL: Is it true, Carter? Are you in Hong Kong right now?
CARTER: Hong Kong? I'm not in Hong Kong. I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station. How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
CAPTAIN DIEL: It's nine-thirty in the morning.
CARTER: Did I say dinner? I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
CAPTAIN DIEL: Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter? I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
CARTER: Two hundred cops? Was Mario Sanchez there? He owes me money.
CAPTAIN DIEL: I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it. Do you know why?
CARTER: Is it because of the hookers, sir? You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
CAPTAIN DIEL: No, Carter. The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong. And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
CARTER: Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor. Captain, you there? Hello? Shit!
