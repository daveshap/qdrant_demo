LOGAN: What's wrong, Available?
JESSICA: Please... No.
LOGAN: Please... no? You mean not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular. Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you."
JESSICA: No. Just no.
LOGAN: You prefer women?
JESSICA: No.
LOGAN: Well then...?
JESSICA: Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
LOGAN: Sad? What made you sad?
JESSICA: A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
LOGAN: Yes... probably he was renewed?
JESSICA: He was killed.
LOGAN: Killed? Why do you use that word?
JESSICA: Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
LOGAN: I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners. Who brought you?
JESSICA: Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
LOGAN: You felt sad. What's your name?
JESSICA: Jessica.
LOGAN: You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
JESSICA: No.
LOGAN: Later.
JESSICA: No.
LOGAN: But you put yourself on the circuit!
JESSICA: I thought I had to do something.
LOGAN: And?
JESSICA: I changed my mind.
LOGAN: And now?
JESSICA: Curious.
LOGAN: About what?
JESSICA: How a Sandman lives.
LOGAN: Let's have sex. I thought you were curious.
JESSICA: Not about that.
LOGAN: I'm listening.
JESSICA: I'm afraid to tell you.
LOGAN: I'm not armed. Well?
JESSICA: Why is it wrong to run?
LOGAN: You shouldn't even think such things... And you picked a strange person to say them to --
JESSICA: I suppose. But what if you want to live?
LOGAN: So? Do what everyone does. Try like hell for renewal.
