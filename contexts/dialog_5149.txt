EVAN: Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
ANDREA: Cute, Evan.
DR. REDFIELD: It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
EVAN: Are you sure? Not even with my father?
DR. REDFIELD: Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
ANDREA: So what did you find.
DR. REDFIELD: This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
EVAN: Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
