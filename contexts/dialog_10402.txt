LAMAR: I've got enough here.
JEROME: Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
IRENE: So you didn't do it after all.
JEROME: I guess somebody beat me to it.
DETECTIVE HUGO: That's the last.
INVESTIGATOR: Something's not right.
DETECTIVE HUGO: He's not here. It's a blind alley.
INVESTIGATOR: No, we've missed something. We Hoover again.
DETECTIVE HUGO: We don't have the manpower.
INVESTIGATOR: Get it. From outside, if you have to.
DETECTIVE HUGO: From what budget?
INVESTIGATOR: I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
DIRECTOR JOSEF: Would you care to look--in the telescope?
INVESTIGATOR: Thank you, no.
DIRECTOR JOSEF: One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
INVESTIGATOR: You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
DIRECTOR JOSEF: Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat. I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be. We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal. So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders. Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us. I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
INVESTIGATOR: No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep. If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him. I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective. In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
