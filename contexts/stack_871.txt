Ubuntu won't boot after changing mounts So I was trying to mount a drive on boot. I was editing /etc/fstab and then I rebooted to see if my drive would mount on boot. Now I can't do anything. The prompt I see Give root password for maintenance(or press Control-D to continue): When I press Control-D this prints: sulogin: cannot read /dev/tty1: Operation not permittedI've tried all kinds of root passwords but none of them work. I tried to tap shift while it boots and nothing happens.EDIT: This question is not a duplicate because when I press Control-D at the prompt I get an error message I'm on a Pine64. Is there any way to salvage the device or save the files?Bootable USB's do not work
