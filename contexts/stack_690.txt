Unattended-upgrades pending reboot prevents shutdown from user Running Ubuntu 14.04 in a public computer room, I have enabled unattended-upgrades and configured to reboot at 02.00 in the night. PCs are dual boot, so a user would reboot the computer in order to boot the other OS, but if u-u had installed some updates, and set it to reboot, then the users would not be able to do it by themselves: if they click on the gear icon, and then choose shutdown and Reboot, the system simply does nothing.If I login as root and try to issue a reboot command, the answer is \"another shutdown already pending\so I have to shutdown -c to cancel it, and thereafter I am able to reboot. This is obviously not what I want, because the users should be able to reboot whenever they want without my (or root) intervention.Could anyone help me please in reaching my goal (=have u-u set to install automatically, and reboot at 2.00 in the night, letting the users free to reboot/shutdown when they want, without giving them root permissions)?Thank you very much,Andrea
