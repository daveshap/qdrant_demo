IKE: Fully. I like her. She has wit.
ELLIE: I left four messages. You don't return my calls.
IKE: So? I never returned your calls, even when we were married. And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
FISHER: Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
IKE: Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
ELLIE: -- It's for you, Ike.
IKE: What?
ELLIE: Journalism lesson number one. If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
IKE: Lesson number two. Never work for your former spouse.
ELLIE: That's not nothing to do with it. You cooked this story up and you know it.
IKE: I didn't cook up a story. I had a source.
ELLIE: Someone reliable, I'm sure. A booze- hound in a bar?
FISHER: In vino veritas.
IKE: Don't knock drunk guys in bars. Drunk guys in bars are good. It means they're not driving.
ELLIE: No, that's what makes you unemployed.
IKE: I merely write the stuff. You're the one that serves it up.
