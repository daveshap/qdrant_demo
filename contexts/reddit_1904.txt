The absolute worst part about being a junior or senior in high school: the emails .
I’ve literally gotten so many emails from schools I’m just not interested in (some of them do a bait me) but geez like every 6 seconds 

“Nhiyhana apply right now for priority consideration” 

“Nhiyhana our application is live right now” 

“We believe in the power of and” 

Like what.
