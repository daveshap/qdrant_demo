Paycuts and new jobs
Just informed we've been made to take paycuts and that certain jobs were removed at my current role. I think I'm going to start applying to new roles, but can I just be honest in explaining to new employers? Saying I would like to come here as a security blanket doesn't seem like that great of a sell. 

I work in marketing/advertising.
