getting a translation job
I graduated last year after majoring in translation and French literature. I'm trilingual yet, I couldn't find any translation jobs as they all require +5 years of experience. So, I settled for a French/English teaching job at an international nursery and worked there for more than 8 months. It shut down since March and I have been unemployed since then. I want to find online translation jobs for beginners but I don't know where to find anything that doesn't require experience. P.s. my country is still under lockdown as the numbers are getting worse. Help?
