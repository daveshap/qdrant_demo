ORDELL: Drink?
JACKIE: I need to talk to you alone.
JACKIE: I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
ORDELL: What the hell you talkin' bout?
JACKIE: Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
ORDELL: How do you know she did that?
JACKIE: I was there, I saw her do it.
ORDELL: Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
JACKIE: I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
ORDELL: Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
JACKIE: Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
