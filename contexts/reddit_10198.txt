My friend has killed himself
There was a guy I met in this sub, a really good guy. I followed many of his posts, and didn't speak to him, till I saw his last post in which he described how he felt and announced how he is gonna take his own life.

 It's really disheartening how our own mind plays tricks with us to the point where we will lose all our hope, dreams and joy in life. How it puts us in a loop where everything seems dull and empty.

This guy was a legend. He tried his best, but still unable to find strenght to carry on. I believe this is the worst way to go. 

I wish I said something more, I wish i knew better. 
Now there is nothing anyone can do. He left thinking worst of himself, feeling worthless after many years of struggle. 

Please dont mind if its written poorly, I had to get this off my chest.

Thanks
