OFFICER PASKI: But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
GRAHAM: Six months.
GRAHAM: And three weeks.
OFFICER PASKI: It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
GRAHAM: It's good advice... Say hi to Marcia for me.
OFFICER PASKI: You take care of yourself... Graham.
