What job should I apply for?
I've been on unemployment since I was laid off due to COVID. My unemployment runs out in a couple weeks and I have lots of bills including rent fast approaching.

I'm a broke, in debt college student living paycheck to paycheck (literally). I pay for 100% of my expenses as I am living on my own.

I was going to apply to walmart or amazon even though I know it will be a drag, I need a job asap.

Previously I was working in sales for years but I'm kind of burned out with sales.

These will of course be temporary jobs and my future will be a career once I complete college. Still I have lots of time and bills to pay until I get my cap and gown.

I'd like to spend my summer doing something cool instead of being stuck inside of a warehouse or walmart (which is basically a warehouse).

But I'll do what I have to do.

Any suggestions for what I should I apply to? I need a job like yesterday
