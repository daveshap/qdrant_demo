CHUCK: You okay?
JOHN: Yeah. How'd you do.
CHUCK: Ninety-six.
JOHN: Congratulations.
CHUCK: What about you?
CHUCK: It's a ninety-one! It's an 'A'!
JOHN: I know.
CHUCK: You know? Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
JOHN: I just can't believe it.
CHUCK: This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again. When you stand up and are counted.
JOHN: I couldn't have done it without you.
CHUCK: Yes you could. You did. This is all you. Nobody else.
