BRIAN: Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are... Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
SHADOW: Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
BRIAN: So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
SHADOW: And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
BRIAN: Nice bunch of guys.
SHADOW: Who all ended up wearing candles for faces... Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
