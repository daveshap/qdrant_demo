NORMAN: When did it come across?
EDMUNDS: Minutes ago. Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
NORMAN: Where's it coming from?
EDMUNDS: No idea. We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
NORMAN: Is it coming from our own computer?
EDMUNDS: Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
NORMAN: Getting anywhere with those?
HARRY: There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
NORMAN: Have you looked outside? Jellyfish. Everywhere. I hate jellyfish. Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
HARRY: Don't do this. Don't psychoanalyze me. I hate squid. Period. Just like you hate jellyfish.
NORMAN: You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
HARRY: Did I?
NORMAN: You don't remember that?
HARRY: I don't remember much. It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it. Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer. Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman. You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine. Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others. It's normal, really, isn't it? In a crisis. The stress. The panic.
BARNES: Fletcher? What are you doing out there?
FLETCHER: They're like pink snow, sir. Sticky.
TED: She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
BARNES: Get out of there. I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
FLETCHER: They're warm. I can feel the heat on my legs.
BARNES: Fletcher, I want you back here.
