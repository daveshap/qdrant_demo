MARY: I bought a new rug.
MARTIN: That's wonderful, Mom.
MARY: What's a revival tent?
MARTIN: It's a place where religious people--
MARY: Marlin Perkins and Jim!
MARTIN: Jim?
MARY: His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
MARTIN: It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
MARY: I spoke to your father the other day.
MARTIN: I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
MARY: Nature made him then broke the mold.
MARTIN: They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
MARY: Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
MARTIN: You have a headache?
MARY: I have a headache. You have a headache?
MARTIN: No, I don't have one.
MARY: You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
MARY: We had a good laugh, didn't we?
MARTIN: Yeah. I guess we did.
MARY: Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
MARTIN: I think I'll go see Debi today.
MARY: Of course you will.
MARTIN: I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
MARY: Take care of her. She's a keeper.
MARTIN: Yeah...
MARY: And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
MARTIN: I have always thought about her and missed her.
