BISHOP: I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
YOLANDE: And when was that?
BISHOP: Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...
YOLANDE: Thirty years ago? I'm not surprised it's gone...
BISHOP: No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
BISHOP: W-w-what are you doing?!
YOLANDE: Performing a miracle.
CHARLES: Ah, Jeanne... come here...! This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
JEANNE: ... You look wonderful...
CHARLES: ... and my crown doesn't fit and... Really??
