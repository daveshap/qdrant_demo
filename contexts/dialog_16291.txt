FRANCIS: You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate... your alert successor... Logan-6.
LOGAN: Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
FRANCIS: Not in my time...
FRANCIS: Why?
LOGAN: Just wondered... what happens?
FRANCIS: Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
LOGAN: But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. One for one. One for one.""
FRANCIS: Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
LOGAN: No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape."
FRANCIS: Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering. You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
MAN: Well? How do you like it?
WOMAN: I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
MAN: Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
WOMAN: Too little.
MAN: Too little? Too little. Okay, wait for me.
LOGAN: Did you ever see Francis-8?
FRANCIS: I never even visited Nursery before tonight. When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
FRANCIS: I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
LOGAN: Of course not! I'm curious, not sick.
