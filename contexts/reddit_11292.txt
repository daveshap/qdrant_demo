Working for the first time in 4 months, and I'm miserable.
 So I got let go from my last job earlier this year. I did not see it coming at all, and was completely blind sided by it on a Friday. I had been there for 2 and a half years, and the previous month had received a glowing review. I started looking for work immediately, but due to everything going on that took a while, and I finally started a new job 3 days ago on Monday. I fucking hate being back at work. I have spent the last 9 and a half years working full time, 40+ hours a week, while only receiving 2 weeks of vacation time a year, half of which were used on sick days because I have never gotten any paid sick days. The last 4 months of being unemployed were amazing. I've been on unemployment, which is a little bit over half of what I was making previously, and with reduced spending I've had no issues staying afloat. I've been able to just exist, unburdened by the 9 to 5 grind, and I am now terrified that I'm going to spend the next 35-40 years working 5-6 days a week, just like I've been doing for the last 10, and this small taste of freedom over the past few months has solidified what I already knew. The vast majority of my days are spent somewhere I don't wanna be, doing something I don't want to be doing, for someone who usually doesn't deserve all the wealth that they have. This is no way to live, and yet I feel trapped by it. I feel so tired, and I haven't even finished my first week yet. I just don't know what to do anymore, but I do know that I don't want the rest of my life to be this. I feel like I forgot how miserable this made me while I was unemployed. Had a panic attack over it on Monday after work, and now I'm on some anxiety meds to help cope. I can't quit either because then I lose my unemployment benefits. God I wish I had declined this job offer and remained unemployed for as long as possible. I was so much happier.
