BIANCA: You looked beautiful last night, you know.
KAT: So did you
CAMERON: She okay?
BIANCA: I hope so.
WALTER: Was that your sister?
KAT: Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm.
WALTER: Funny.
WALTER: I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to?
KAT: No, Daddy.
WALTER: So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
KAT: Parts of it.
WALTER: Which parts?
KAT: The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
WALTER: Bianca did what?
KAT: What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her?
WALTER: No -- impressed.
WALTER: You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
KAT: When I go?
WALTER: Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check.
