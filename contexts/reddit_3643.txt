Girls, please, if you reject a guy that asked you out, don't try and get his attention, you already know he likes you and you're just playing with him.
And those things people say like oh well, I'm not interested but we can still be friends is not healthy at all, why would you want the attention of a guy that you know likes you but he knows he can't have you. 

I find it extremely infuriating when this happens to me and sometimes I need to be rude in telling girls to please leave me alone so they get the mesaage. 

Rant over.
