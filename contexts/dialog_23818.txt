MAYA: It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
MILES: Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
MAYA: Yeah, weird. But great.
MILES: Yeah. Definitely.
MAYA: So what's your novel about?
MILES: Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
MAYA: What's the title?
MILES: The Day After Yesterday.""
MAYA: Oh. You mean... today?
MILES: Um... yeah but it's more...
MAYA: So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
MILES: Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
MAYA: Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
MILES: Yeah. Thanks.
MAYA: Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
MILES: A paper?
MAYA: Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
MILES: Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
MAYA: I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
MILES: So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
MAYA: Well...
MILES: I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
MAYA: Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos. Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
MILES: My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
MAYA: Can I ask you a personal question?
MILES: Sure.
MAYA: Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
