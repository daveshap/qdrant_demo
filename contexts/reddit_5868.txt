What can I specialize in if I'm getting my bachelor's in psych? Something child related.
Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on getting my bachelor's in psych but I've heard that getting a good paying job will be hard unless I specialize in something. What are some examples of specialties that would include working with children? If possible, something that pays well. I live in Chicago if that matters
