Is "oligarchs" an accurate term for influential people in the governments of Russia or other countries?
"Oligarch" has become a [commonly used term](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS726US734&biw=1440&bih=794&tbm=nws&ei=GlYIW-7KA8LCzgKPyoqIBw&q=oligarch&oq=oligarch&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.8408.8408.0.9751.1.1.0.0.0.0.41.41.1.1.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.41....0.Dyf_tOnwzto) to describe various [persons](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/04/politics/mueller-special-counsel-investigation-russian-oligarchs/index.html) allegedly involved with Russian meddling in the 2016 US elections.

An "oligarchy* is defined as ["a government in which a small group exercises control especially for corrupt and selfish purposes"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oligarchy) and an *oligarch* is a ["member of a small governing faction."](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/oligarch)

For the first part of the century, [Russian business and politics were indeed controlled by a small group of elites.](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/0895330053147994) However, some experts now argue that Russian power is concentrated essentially in one man, Putin, who does not tolerate competition, which means [the influence of others is limited to the point that they cannot really be called oligarchs.](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/06/10/isn-oligarchs-who-rule-russia-anymore/hA9sGsk0TzlniQ0bmhECDN/story.html)

On the other hand, power is more diffuse in Western countries and money seems to be [correlated with considerable influence in capitalist systems.](https://www.opendemocracy.net/samuel-jones/european-elections-and-campaign-finance-show-us-money) In the US, for example, it has been shown that the power to influence public policy is [nearly monopolized by a small group of economic elites,](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B) causing some to conclude that [the US is in fact an oligarchy, not a democracy.](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746)

**Questions:**

* Is it accurate to call the Russians in question *oligarchs*? 
* Is it accurate for people who [donate millions of dollars to US political campaigns](https://www.opensecrets.org/overview/topindivs.php?cycle=2016&view=fc) — like George Soros and Sheldon Adelson — to be called *oligarchs*?
* What about other countries where a relatively small group of people control the government?
