VADA: Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
MR. BIXLER: Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
VADA: This is one big house for one single person.
MR. BIXLER: Well, you never can tell... I might get a pet.
VADA: How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
MR. BIXLER: Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
VADA: How much does it cost?
MR. BIXLER: Thirty five dollars.
VADA: What do you get for that?
MR. BIXLER: Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
VADA: No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
MR. BIXLER: It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
