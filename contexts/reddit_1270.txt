90 days.
Almost jumped 14 stories 90 days ago. Hungover, isolated, ashamed, totally hopeless. It was Christmas and I had zero will to live. Jumping made total rational sense. The end of all this pointless suffering. But I didn't. 

I called the hotline. I got help. I saw a psychologist. Diagnosed me with anxiety and depression. But also took a look at my self reported levels of drinking. Explained what alcohol actually does to the brain. He told me in patients with depression and anxiety who also drink, if they get sober their symptoms get easier to manage or even disappear completely.

I quit cold Turkey. My symptoms decreased 50% in frequency and 60% in severity. I'm no longer suicidal. When I get negative automatic thoughts I notice them. When I get in a thought loop I can break out.

Please, if you are suffering and drinking, give it a try. You have nothing to lose. I am going on a retreat tomorrow and I'll be on a flight for a bit, but I'll answer any questions and reply to all comments.
