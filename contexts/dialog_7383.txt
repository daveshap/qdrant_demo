LEX: Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
TRIP: Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
LEX: Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out.
TRIP: Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
LEX: Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
