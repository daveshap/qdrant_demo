Fuck Anxiety. I Am Legend.
I had an explosive panic attack yesterday that shot up my heart rate and blood pressure. I almost passed out. But guess what. I slept for 12 hours, and got right back into the thick of life! I refuse to crumble every time anxiety gets to me. I am a functional anxious motherfucker. But I'm also a warrior and will not back down! Stay hard!
