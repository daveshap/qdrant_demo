Fired from first Career Job, how should I proceed?
 (Cross Posted in personal finance for questions about the pay)

Hello /r/careerguidance I'm quite possibly experiencing one of the most soul crushing, self worth ruining things of my life, and I could use some advice. I had my first real job as an engineer, and was fired, not for performance, or misconduct, but for reasons which essentially amount to "poor culture fit" after a bit under a year. I've been miserable since, but have been applying to jobs religiously, the only problem is, the responses I'm getting are from jobs which represent a 25% pay cut, and are not the same position in the career. I'm unsure of how to proceed. I need a job, and the area in which I'm applying is closer to home which has a significantly lower cost of living than where I relocated for the position I lost, but I don't know if I should accept the first offer that comes in, or if I should wait for one which matches my goals.

Not only that, but I'm extremely embarrassed about being fired, and am having trouble explaining it out loud in phone interviews, essentially its boiling down to "I left because my energy and ambition did not adequately match that of my group" (Read: I'm annoying and everyone hates me) or "I was asked to leave for" the above reason, if its not asked whether or not I was asked to leave, I don't bring it up, and I'm not sure if that is the right decision.

I'm really lost, I'm really depressed, and I don't know what to do, because at the end of the day, being an engineer was extremely boring, and I didn't like what I was doing, but I'm not really qualified for anything else since I was so early in my career.
