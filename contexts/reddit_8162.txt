Is the addition of $1 trillion to the national debt in 14 months under Trump cause for concern, or par for the course?
Today, I read an [article](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/mar/15/donald-trump-adds-1-trillion-national-debt-14-mont/) from March 15, 2018 which stated that:

>President Trump has now amassed his first $1 trillion in debt, crossing that ignominious mark late last week — and analysts said it’s just a taste of what’s to come after the tax-cuts and spending spree of recent months.

To put this into [some context](http://www.businessinsider.com/national-debt-deficit-added-under-president-barack-obama-2017-1), under President Obama, the national debt grew:

>...by about $9 trillion, or an increase of 86&#37;.

(Of course, that was in 8 or so years.)

Given those numbers, is the debt increasing roughly $1 trillion in 14 months under President Trump exceptional or a bad sign, or is it relatively normal in our modern economy? Keeping in mind, of course, that President Obama inherited an economy that was seemingly in [bad shape](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/president-obama-the-legacy/eight-years-later-economy-president-obama-s-legacy-n703616) and President Trump inherited one in [arguably healthier condition](https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/opinion/columnists/ron-eachus/2017/02/21/obama-inherited-recession-trump-inherited-primed-pump/98201378/).

As a final aside, an [article](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/national-debt-trump/) from last year stated that the national debt had fallen by $102 billion since Trump's inauguration; much has changed since then, but it's still interesting to me in light of the above.

>We have checked these numbers and set them in context, and found that the national debt did indeed fall by $102 billion between 20 January and the end of July 2017. This decline is also historically remarkable, in both absolute and percentage terms. This six-month fall in the national debt is also significant when measured against the size of the overall economy.

(I'm looking for an economic/historical perspective for comparison, which I feel could be answered factually.)
