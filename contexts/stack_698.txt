Does there exist a pdf-viewer for ubuntu offering up to 6400 percent zoom? The question is in the title. I can hardly believe it, but after having tried each of 'evince', 'Master PDF', 'okular', 'xpdf', I am quite sure that none of these well-known readers offers as high a zoom factor as does e.g. Acroreader. For my work it is indispensable to have at least 6400% zoom, and, having recently changed to ubuntu, I now seem to find myself in a situation in which the only way is to try to get Acroreader running via Wine (which I didn't try yet, and hope to be able to avoid trying).
