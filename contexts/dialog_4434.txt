ROCCO: Anybody you think is evil?
CONNOR: Yes.
ROCCO: Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
CONNOR: Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
MURPHY: Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
CONNOR: Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
MURPHY: Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it.
