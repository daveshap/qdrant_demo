Struggling to pick a rotation lab; pls help
tldr: I'm struggling to pick my first rotation lab. Reading papers doesn't really get me excited about the science since they're so dry. 

I'm an incoming chemistry PhD student, and I am really struggling to pick my first rotation lab. My program has a pretty long list of professors I can choose from, and I don't have very clear research interests, so I am struggling to narrow down my list of profs to reach out to. 

I wish I knew exactly what kind of research I wanted to do, but frankly it's all equally interesting and uninspiring at the same time. It's hard for me to get excited about research just from reading a paper. I prefer learning about science through talks and such. I'm the kind of person that will become interested in just about anything so long as it is presented well. I'm afraid that I'll overlook a great lab because I can only base my decision off of lab websites and papers.

It doesn't help that when I met with my first year advisor, I presented a list of about seven PIs that I was interested in (I made this list just from an initial gut reaction when reading the research summaries on their websites), and my advisor gave me names of another six PIs I should look into. So now I have this long list and I don't know how to narrow it down. Maybe I'm overthinking this decision since I'll have three rotations total, but I can't help but feel that I can't make an informed decision from the papers alone (since as I said before, they just don't do it for me in terms of getting me excited about the science).

I will also reach out to students who have rotated in these labs to ask about the lab environment. I'm struggling with the science aspect of this decision. 

Am I overthinking this? Should I just pick a few labs that seem interesting and not worry so much about missing out on other labs that might also be interesting to me but I don't know it? Any insight or advice would be much appreciated.
