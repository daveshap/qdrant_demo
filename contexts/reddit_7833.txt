Is there a sub where I can post looking for bibliography help and recommendations for my Masters thesis?
A lot of the books I was going to use are in a library that is now closed down for COVID-19 and I have no idea when I’ll have access to them again.

I feel a little bit overwhelmed and confused as I’m having to restructure my whole project around different bibliography and am really pretty much limited to either books that I already have or books I can find online.

I have a very limited budget and unfortunately actually buying the books is out of the question, so I was hoping maybe people could help me with recommendations of works I could check out and could be useful for my work. Is there a sub for that? Or is that something I could do here? I could really really use some help, I feel like I’m falling apart.

My thesis is in the field of film studies/archival studies too, if there’s anyone out there who might be interested and able to help :) I won’t reveal the specifics of it on here but will gladly discuss it in private or even in public if it seems that it’s okay and appropriate.

Thank you!
