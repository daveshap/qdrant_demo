Finally got a new job, so thankful I could cry
Been psuedo-unemployed all of January (I work a part-time job but hours have been cut because no patients in the hospital). My bank was in the red half the month and I had to beg a friend for money to afford gas to go to interviews. 

Yesterday, received news that I got a part time job of 30 hours, guaranteed, to work as the office manager of a local company. They're paying me $20/hr. I have never been so relieved. Getting my dignity back is the most precious gift of all.
