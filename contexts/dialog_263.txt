CATES: Well?
HAMMOND: It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
CATES: This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
HAMMOND: Back you up? Now why would I wanna do that?
CATES: If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
HAMMOND: But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
CATES: Bullshit. Attitude and experience get you through...
HAMMOND: I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
CATES: You need five years training to handle a joint like...
HAMMOND: Hey, you wanna bet?
CATES: I got two problems. Number one, I'm not playin' games. Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
HAMMOND: If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
CATES: Why? Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
HAMMOND: That's never been one of my problems.
CATES: I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
HAMMOND: What are you talkin' about?
CATES: You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail. And whatever it is, you're part of it.
HAMMOND: I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
CATES: The bet's off.
