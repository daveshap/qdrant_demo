STEPHANIE: That was fun last night.
MILES: Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
STEPHANIE: Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
STEPHANIE: Where's Jack?
MILES: He had to make a phone call.
STEPHANIE: So what are you up to today, Miles?
MILES: Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
STEPHANIE: Huh.
MILES: Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
STEPHANIE: Oops. Sorry.
MILES: You golf?
STEPHANIE: Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
MILES: Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
