Find a model for two continuous predictors of a single categorical DV Suppose I ask subjects to place a value on two cups: A and B; on a scale from -10 to +10.She says A is worth -4 and B is worth 9.Now I say 'ok pick one'. She picks one. Now I ask 300 people the same thing.Simply, I want to model how their valuation of the options predicts which cup they pick (e.g. the greater the value they assign to one over the other, the more likely they are to pick it).What's the model?(I want to use a linear model because I want to control for other factors).Thank you!
