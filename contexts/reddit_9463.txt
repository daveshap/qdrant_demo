Just want to say how much I appreciate this sub!
Other subs like /r/personalfinance and /r/frugal assume you want to act like Scrooge, or already have Scrooge's money. I'm so glad to see this is catching on, because dignity is a huge part of being poor, and most of us are just trying to look, and act, normal so we can get ahead.

In the last 10 years, my wife and I have had money, been broke and homeless, run our own business, failed at that business and filed bankruptcy, made some great choices and some stupid ones, had a baby, and gone back to school. We're now working on organizing a statewide renter's union to address housing struggles head on. 

I'm looking forward to sharing what I know and would love to answer any questions I can about bankruptcy, renting, or whatever else. Hang in there, you're looking fine /r/povertyfinance!
