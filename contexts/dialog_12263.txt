VERONICA: Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
HEATHER CHANDLER: Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
BETTY: Sorry Veronica.
VERONICA: Betty Finn. Gosh.....
VERONICA: I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
BETTY: That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
VERONICA: Don't say that.
BETTY: Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
VERONICA: I was talking with someone!
HEATHER CHANDLER: Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
