DON JAIME: Sit down, I'm going to need your help.
RAMONA: What's the matter?
DON JAIME: Sit down, woman, sit down. You like me, don't you?
RAMONA: I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
DON JAIME: Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
RAMONA: Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
DON JAIME: Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days. You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
RAMONA: But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
