Have not heard one word in over two months from one job since temp closing due to Covid. Is this a good reason to start job hunting?
the last time I heard from my  manager was about a few days after the store closed, and basically was "yeah we're closing, no idea what will happen. I'll keep you updated." But the update never came, and now it's been over 2 months and still no word from her. No way to contact, nothing. Do you think my job is toast?
