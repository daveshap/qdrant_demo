Clinical we / therapeutic we Nurses, therapists, and others in similar caring roles often use \"we\" when talking to patients.<blockquote>  How are we doing today?</blockquote>I'm looking for the grammatical/technical name of this mode of speaking, and especially a reference on it that I can link to.I believe I have heard it called either \"clinical we\" or \"therapeutic we,\" but I can't find resources when Googling for those terms.
