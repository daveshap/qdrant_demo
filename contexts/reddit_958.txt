Today I made appointments for the dentist, eye dr, and physical therapist!!!! It was very draining and I had to get a little drunk to do it but I did it lol
Small steps! Now I just have to remove the alcohol from the equation.




Edit: wow thanks so much for all the love and kind words! I love that we can all support each others small victories, and I'm glad I can share my excitement here with fellow humans who understand how I feel.
