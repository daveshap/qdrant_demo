SPOCK: The peace conference.
KIRK: What peace conference?
SPOCK: Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work... the conspirators obviously intend to try again...
UHURA: We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
LT. SAAVIK: I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
CHEKOV: Where IS the conference?
KIRK: She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
