ERIN: I want my fucking money --
ED: I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here -- Do you mind?
ERIN: Yeah, I mind. You bet your ass I mind.
ED: Oh, Jesus. You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
ERIN: It's my paycheck. Which I earned. Which I deserve. Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
ED: Erin, you're a big girl. If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
ERIN: Fuck you. Make time. Cause I bust my ass for you. I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you. And what do you do for me? Huh? You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once? Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing? Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
ED: Is that what you want?
ERIN: I want my paycheck. By the end of the day.
ED: I'll see what I can do.
ERIN: You might want to think real hard about the amount, too. My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
MATTHEW: Can I play roller hockey?
ERIN: We'll see.
MATTHEW: When?
MATTHEW: Randy's mom said yes right away.
ERIN: Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
