My mom tells me to “stop being negative” when I mention my struggles!
Whatever I mention to her that I’m struggling with she gets angry at me for feeling that way and she just expects me to just stop the feeling! Mind you I can’t find any reason why I feel that way. I can’t feel down or not be ok. I must be happy and ok with everything and be positive. It sucks when you have nobody around to listen but unhelpful people.
