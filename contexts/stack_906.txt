18.04 / login loop / Radeon Xpress 1250 (RS600M) on Samsung R60 plus laptop I upgraded my 16.04 to 18.04, I see the login screen, can log in and will be immediately logged out.I know many people have this problem and searched and tried everything:* using lightlm* installed unity desktop* checked for X errors* etc.No success. I really don't have a clue what's going on or how to even track down what's up.Is there any workaround for this problem? Any way to track it down?I suspect that it has to do with the graphics driver. But I didn't install anything special and the graphics card is very old. 16.04 worked... so I'm really wondering how this can happen.
