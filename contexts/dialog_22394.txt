VINCENT: I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
TONY: Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about. I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
SAM: What's the story?
TONY: It's an international thing. Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job. But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
VINCENT: Do you have the tape?
TONY: I might know where you could get a copy.
