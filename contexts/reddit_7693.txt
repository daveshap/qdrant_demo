I will soon be the last remaining "senior" lab member, being pressured to stay after graduation as a post-doc. What would you do in my situation? Help!
In short, due to coincidental timing, a **huge** portion (~2/3) of my lab will be moving on by the end of next year either due to graduation, retirement, or opportunities elsewhere. All of the departures are on good terms and I legitimately like all of my coworkers. However, this includes the PI of the lab who planning retirement. Due to my experience in the lab (4+ years here), I seem to be a candidate for eventually taking over the lab. Indeed, at this point, the PI has already taken two steps back and offloaded many responsibilities to me (even though I am still technically a graduate student).

However, a few considerations:

* I enjoy the work, but over the past few years I've come to discover that I do **not** enjoy journal writing. My original plan was to enter industry, not become a post-doc.
* Is it normal to be concerned about the future of the lab? Since the departure of two post-docs (who have gone to form their own labs), I seem to be left holding too many of the keys.
* The funding situation is excellent, with the next several years already secured.
* The pay differential is worth considering. Personally, I would take a lower paying job to have a better work-life balance, but my University seriously gives post-docs "the shaft". The cost of living in my area is insane, and industry in my area *easily* compensates over double to what my University offers.

On one hand, I sincerely want the work that my lab performs to continue. I think the work we do has legitimate value to society in terms of potentially impacting lives. On the other hand, there are some "cons" associated with staying. If I stayed, I would: assume a mountain of administration duties, have to rebuild infrastructure to replace lost personnel, manage the remaining students, potentially teach a class once my PI retires, and of course all this with a post-doc salary.

Has anyone been in or seen a similar situation? Right now, it feels like I'm in the middle of a burning house and I'm the only person holding a fire extinguisher. I would greatly appreciate any thoughts or advice!
