Got rejected from the only job i was qualified for
Hi,

I am currently about to become a new grad graduating from computer science and last summer i did my internship as a janitor. I really enjoyed it and learned about cs stuff. I was thinking about going full time as a janitor after I graduate so when I knew I was graduating, I asked my boss if I could go full time but it turns out that they arent hiring and laid off all their interns cus of the pandemic . This absolutely sucked because a janitor was the only software position I qualified for and now I dont know what to do. Im thinking about getting a job at McDonalds but I will need beg in front of the manager to get the job. Any thoughts as to what I should do?
