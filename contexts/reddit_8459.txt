What legal/policy/legislative strategies can be used to push back against gerrymandering?
[Gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) is a practice intended to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by manipulating district boundaries.

[Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/supreme-court-gerrymandering-census.html). This last week, SCOTUS ruled on a two major gerrymandering cases, one favoring democrats and another favoring republicans.

In both cases before the court, NC and MD, one party felt that a state's districts were unfairly drawn to give one political party a significant advantage.  Whether you agree with SCOTUS or not, they do not intend to accept any kind of standard for when a district is "too gerrymandered" and have left it to states to decide how to redraw their districts.

Gerrymandering occurs in the leadup to congressional redistricting, which means that a gerrymandered district can persist for many election cycles. This also make it a long, slow process that is very difficult to unwind.  What can be done now and in the future to make our elections more representative? 

While it is possible that many (mostly blue) states may pass laws that call for independent districting commissions, what can be done about states that have no intention of doing anything but making this problem worse?
