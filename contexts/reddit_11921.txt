Girl I like is having a tough time and I don't know what to do
Slowly over the course of this year, i've grown to like a girl who's the captain of the sports team I've joined at university. My feelings for her are pretty strong however she's having a really tough time. She's currently bombarded with work as she's a final year where as I still have year to go. She's in charge of the sports team which is very big and active so it takes up a lot of her time. She's also having trouble moving on from her previous relationship who happens to be a friend of mine. He's not a really good friend of mine but we still see each other on a regular basis. They broke up last summer and it's still proving tough for her where as the ex is in a new relationship. What makes it worse for her is that her ex is also within the sports team so she see's him as well as his current partner on a regular basis. 

Basically I have no idea what to do. It just feels that she's not in the right frame of mind to have another relationship due to these issues. Ideally i'd love to ask her out but i'm in 2 minds about it. One is saying go for it but the other is saying give her space or you might lose out on a friend but this freaks me out as as she'll be graduating in a few months time so I feel like i'm running out of time. 

Just to clarify we see each other and talk on a daily basis, I'd say we're fairly good friends, it just hasn't progressed any further due to me not knowing what to do. My confidence isn't the strongest but it certainly has improved a drastic amount since joining university and meeting so many new people. 

Any help is appreciated thanks!
