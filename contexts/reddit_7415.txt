The Teacher has put no work into the class (Macro-economics)
I am in a Masters Economics Program and for the Macro-economic Analysis course the professor has put in 0 effort.

I understand that he had to transition to online over the summer, I understand that he has other policy related work that he want's to go do but he is being paid a salary to teach. SO TEACH.

The man literally assigns 300 pages to read per week, he rarely creates notes or slides himself to make the material easy to digest, he literally just assigns the entire reading, this week we were supposed to focus on Minsky the man assigns a boat load of readings:

Mehrling - The Vision of Hyman P. Minsky - 30 pages 

Minsky - John Maynard Keynes ch 4-6 - 61 pages 

Minsky 1992 - Financial Instability Hypothesis -10 pages 

Minsky 1993 - On the Non-Neutrality of Money - 6 pages 

Minsky Stabilizing an Ustable Eocnomy ch 8-9 - 55 pages 

totaling162â€¬ PAGES!

The assignments are totally left field, he asks questions that he never demonstrates how to do in our weekly zoom meetings and some parts of the question you have to "guess" or "eyeball" it? WTF? I don't see economists at the FED or Chase eyeballing things. 

His lectures consist of him ranting on and on for hours with no structure. Other courses at least I can say I learnt something but in his class I am just more confused, can't wait to leave this school and pursue my masters else where!
