SOOZE: It was a racial incident.
JEFF: It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
SOOZE: It got that close.
JEFF: Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
SOOZE: Oh, yeah?
JEFF: Yeah.
SOOZE: Okay, what would you have done.
JEFF: I would've stopped it.
SOOZE: How?
JEFF: I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
SOOZE: Jeff. Jeff.
JEFF: ... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
SOOZE: Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
JEFF: Sooze.
SOOZE: What?
JEFF: Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
SOOZE: What feelings?
JEFF: Us.
SOOZE: Of course.
JEFF: And?
SOOZE: Come with me.
JEFF: No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
SOOZE: So what do you wanna do?
JEFF: Nothing.
SOOZE: No one does nothing, Jeff.
JEFF: Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
SOOZE: New ground?
JEFF: Mm-hm.
SOOZE: Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
JEFF: Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
SOOZE: My goal is to make art.
JEFF: So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
SOOZE: Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
JEFF: Mm-mm.
SOOZE: So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
JEFF: No, no.
SOOZE: So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
JEFF: I don't know.
SCUFF: Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
TIM: Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
SCUFF: Just one?
TIM: Yeah.
