MANAGER: Thank you for coming so quickly. The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
STANTZ: Has this ever happened before?
MANAGER: Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
STANTZ: Did you ever report it to anyone?
MANAGER: Heavens, no! The owners don't like us to even talk about it. I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
STANTZ: Yes, sir. Don't worry. We handle this kind of thing all the time.
