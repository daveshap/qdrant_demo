LACY: Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
CLARK: Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
LACY: My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
CLARK: No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
LACY: That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
CLARK: Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
LACY: What about here?
CLARK: Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
LACY: Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
CLARK: That sounds kind of pessimistic.
LACY: No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
LACY: I feel kind of light-headed . . .
CLARK: Don't worry, I've got you.
