Caring is COOL
I hate the mentality that whoever cares less it the winner in the relationship. What a shit attitude. I want to be with someone who cares just as much as I do about everything. It feels good to care about things. 

It's not cool to make someone feel like shit because you're acting like/actually don't care.
