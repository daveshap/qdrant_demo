My Boss criticized my work as Hacking
I work in Production Support. Whenever we get issues/requests I always think of the best approach to resolving the issue/getting something done. Today my boss pulled the plug on me and said my approaches have been too hacky, which is a result of my comfort in the environment.

Although hearing this has a cool ring to it, I feel in professional setting this more of an ethical issue. Do you think I should take this as a warning?
