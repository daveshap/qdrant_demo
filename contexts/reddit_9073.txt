Should world leaders use the phrase "Radical Islam" when discussing IS influenced terrorist attacks?
With [Trump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/742053354189299712) and some [Fox News Anchors](https://twitter.com/MonicaCrowley/status/742055115373326341) attacking Obama for not mentioning Radical Islam in his speech. I'm brought back to this [interesting Bloomberg article](http://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-01-19/why-obama-can-t-call-charlie-hebdo-terrorists-radical-islamists-) that cites both Bush and Obama as not using the term since
>The long war against radical Islamic terrorists requires at least the tacit support of many radical Muslims.

What are the pros and cons around using that language?

Those who are upset at Obama and other world leaders for utilizing a more toned down rhetoric, what positives do you think will come from specifically calling out "radical Islam"?

Those of you who agree with Bloomberg and the Bush & Obama administrations where do you draw the line between radical Muslims, and radical Muslim terrorists?
