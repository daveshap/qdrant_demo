MUTCHIE: What ya doin' out so late? Hidin' from the cops?
DOYLE: I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer. I come by to help you carry out your money.
MUTCHIE: They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
DOYLE: You want some eggs.
MUTCHIE: Why not?
DOYLE: Hey, Mutch! You want bacon?
MUTCHIE: Yeah!
DOYLE: Where the hell is it?
MUTCHIE: Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
