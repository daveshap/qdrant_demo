How to make a low pass filter of current, instead of voltage? Is there a way to low-pass filter current, rather than voltage?  Let's suppose there is a circuit consisting of a current source and a load.  The current source may have a little bit of current noise at high frequencies.  I'd like to figure out what can be inserted in between the source and load in this case to suppress that. (Note: the load may not be resistive, and may have strong nonlinearities)
