Ubuntu cannot detect operating system I have been having an issue with Ubuntu 17.04 hanging on the purple load screen and have only been able to fix the issue by changing to legacy/BIOS safe boot and selecting 'nomodeset'. Now when trying to install alongside Windows it says it cannot find the operating system, is this related to legacy boot mode? (Windows 10; AMD FX9800p; Radeon R7)
