Is it okay to give up on my dreams......?
And do something just for the money? Saw a career counselor at a local community college yesterday. She asked me why I wanted to be in med lab tech and I immediately said for the money. She tried to encourage me to find something I’m passionate about. But I’m only passionate about artistic things. I like games as artistic expression. I like cinematography. I’m not creative or talented though. And you can’t go to film school. That’s irresponsible right? 100k in debt and a useless degree. 

So is it okay to just do something for the money?

Edit: I’ve been at work so haven’t been able to reply or even read all of the things people have said to me. (I’ve been trying to find the time to add this for the last 3 hours.) Thanks everyone for giving me so much feedback. I unfortunately am working a 10 hour shift and will not be able to read anything or reply until much later in the day. I will be DMing some of you. Thank you.
