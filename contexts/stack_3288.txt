Anime: people are on a space ship that never lands, something aboard the ship that's very dark, old enough to have been on VHS I remember this anime vaguely but it made me feel quite creeped out, I don't think it had multiple parts but it certainly could have.  Possibly people were cryogenically asleep or something? I seem to recall maybe a black goo involved with the antagonist but maybe not.It's not the episode of Cowboy Bebop with the rotten sandwich, it was 100% dark, little humor if any, and they didn't land at all - very isolated.
