I overheard my mom crying on the phone today because she wanted me to go to Harvard and I was rejected... even though I'll be starting at Northwestern in a few days
Made a throwaway to tell this story, since I really need a place to vent right now. Orientation at Northwestern starts super late due to the quarter system, so I've just been chilling at home while all my other friends have left for college. While I was watching TV in the living room last night, I thought I heard my mom say my name while she was on the phone in her bedroom. I was curious so I eavesdropped a little, and that's when I heard my mom sobbing "all I wanted was for (insert my name here) to go to Harvard, but he wasn't good enough." I don't know who she was talking to, but I'm assuming it was to a relative or a friend, since my mom is part of the Chinese community in my town that loves to gossip about college and especially about which colleges their kids will be attending. I left at that point and don't really know how I've been feeling since, and I guess that's why I'm venting here.

So basically, my parents are both from China and met while they were both graduate students at Harvard. Ever since I was young, they constantly made it clear to me that Harvard was the only school that they wanted me to attend. Basically everything they made me do was to make me a more competitive applicant and increase my chances of getting into Harvard. They built up this expectation that I'd follow their legacy and didn't even consider that I might not get in. Fast forward to last December, and I found out I was deferred after applying early action. My parents were clearly disappointed, but still held out hope that I'd be accepted in the regular admissions cycle. Then, on decision day, I got my rejection letter and couldn't even look my parents in the eye. After getting all my decisions, I considered my choices and decided to attend Northwestern.

Ever since, I could tell that they've been disappointed in me, even though they never said it to my face. It was always small comments like "oh I heard (insert name here) from your school got into Harvard, what do you think they did that you didn't?" or "I think Northwestern's a good school, but it's not in the same league as Harvard." Hearing my mom literally cry on the phone because I didn't get into Harvard was the confirmation I needed that they were, in fact, disappointed in me as their son. I'm sorry Mom, that I wasn't good enough to get into Harvard. I really fucking tried, okay? Northwestern's a good school too, I wish you could be happy that I was going there instead.

Okay, rant over, thanks for listening.
