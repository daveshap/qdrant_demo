I was bracing for job loss...
I live in Canada and was bracing for job loss. My husband's job is essential and he just got promoted, so we weren't freaking completely out, but beginning of February I immediately went into extreme frugal mode. 'Just in case', I said. I basically re-budgeted as if I didn't have an income again. A huge saving grace was the fact I paid off my CC recently, and negotiated a lower rate on my LOC.

Since February, I've been bracing at work. We found out we fall into the essential category, so my employer stayed open. Lay-offs happened, and I somehow made it through. We were told our employer could hold out for 2 months without income before a second round would hit. We were told to expect pay-cuts as well.

This week, we switched gears and branched out to a new division for our products. It has been a huge turning point. I no longer need to take a pay cut to keep my job. We are going to be beyond busy in the next two weeks, forecasting into the entire summer.

I picked up the mail, and our mortgage rate was also successfully reduced due to a drop in prime. All my bills are paid for the month. My paycheque hit my account last night and I finally broke down into tears. There was no reduction. It was a full pay cheque.

Always prepare for the worst. Just in case.
