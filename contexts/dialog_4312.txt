MICHAEL: I can't believe she's making jokes.
CAROLYN: Sshhh. After going through the safety deposit box
MICHAEL: Grateful!?
CAROLYN: ... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to
MICHAEL: That's it!
CAROLYN: What are you doing?
MICHAEL: This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
CAROLYN: Well, I'd like to read them.
MICHAEL: No. We're going to lock this up and --
CAROLYN: STOP IT! I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
