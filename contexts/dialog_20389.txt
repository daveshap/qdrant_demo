MARSHALL: He waved to you?
KAREN: I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
MARSHALL: You wave back?
KAREN: I didn't have time.
MARSHALL: I imagine you would've though.
KAREN: Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon. She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
MARSHALL: So?
KAREN: So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
MARSHALL: He doesn't seem to hold a grudge. What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long? Any thoughts on that one?
KAREN: None I'd like to share.
