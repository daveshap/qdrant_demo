Stop thinking that is the only person that you would ever click with
Okay so I saw some posts on this sub about some  people who were getting panicked about not getting much of a response back from someone who seemed really interesting at the first date.

I also read stuff like "I haven't felt this way with someone else in a long time" or "I've never felt so comfortable with someone before and I don't want to lose him". And I also get to hear the same from some of my friends but I never really talk to them about what's the best thing to do because I tried that a couple of times but they usually start saying to me stuff like "you don't know me" or "no I only want him" which is annoying.

Therefore I thought why not to write a post about it and tell you all that hey if the person you had a good first date with seems distant to you now and is not really showing much of an interest anymore, drop him. Find another date. Because if he really was the one he would have still been interested into you. It's as simple as that. The person who is meant for you won't do that.
