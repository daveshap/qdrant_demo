LANGE: Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
TREVOR: Where's my wife?
LANGE: Okay then. Here's the scoop.
TREVOR: What evidence?
LANGE: For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
TREVOR: It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
LANGE: I did read that, yes. What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
