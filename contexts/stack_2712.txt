Viscous force and it's proportionality constant \"Introduction of Mechanics\" states:$F_v = \u2212Cv$,where $F_v$ is viscous force and  $C$ is a constant that depends on the fluid and the geometry ofthe body. For objects of simple shape moving slowly through a gas atlow pressure, C can be calculated from first principles. For a sphere ofradius r moving at low speed through a common fluid like water or air,C = 6\u03c0\u03b7 r.How does C depends upon fluid and geometry of body?Why is it necessary for the sphere to move slowly and at low pressure to be have C = 6\u03c0\u03b7 r?What's the first principle?
