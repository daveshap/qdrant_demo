KATE: Thank you.
DADE: Okay. I'll copy it.
KATE: Okay, thank you.
PLAGUE: The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
DADE: I told you, I don't play well with others.
PLAGUE: Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
PLAGUE: Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
DADE: That's bullshit.
PLAGUE: What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
DADE: You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
PLAGUE: Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
PLAGUE: Talk to me.
DADE: I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
PLAGUE: Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
DADE: Kate, listen.
KATE: Uh, hold on...
DADE: I have to tell you something.
CEREAL: Hold on a second!
NIKON: Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
CEREAL: Looks like a hacker wrote it.
