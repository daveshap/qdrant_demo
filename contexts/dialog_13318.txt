NATHAN: Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
GABRIELLE: Oui, doctor, oui.
NATHAN: Good morning... We need a name for him, don't we?
GABRIELLE: Oui.
NATHAN: You decide. Today is your day.
GABRIELLE: Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute! I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
NATHAN: Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
GABRIELLE: Oui. Perfect!
NATHAN: Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
