VERONICA: We're breaking up. I am out!
J.D.: Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
VERONICA: You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
J.D.: Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
VERONICA: I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
J.D.: Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
