GRADY: Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
HANNAH GREEN: I would if I knew where I was taking him.
GRADY: Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
HANNAH GREEN: Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
GRADY: That strikes me as odd.
HANNAH GREEN: James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but... Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
JAMES LEER: Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
GRADY: What's he saying?
HANNAH GREEN: His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
GRADY: Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
GRADY: Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
JAMES LEER: Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
GRADY: All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
HANNAH GREEN: The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
GRADY: I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
