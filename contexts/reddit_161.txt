I am felling a down.
I am a 16 y old male. I study in Romania and I am in 10th grade. For reference, I have 2 more years until I take the BAC. The result will pretty much determine the college I will go to. I want to aim very high - like I would even enter with tax - high. Many say I am a smart student. The problem is that I don't trust myself that much. At the semester's exam I was lower than some people, and lower than I expected (my grade was 7 from 10), even though the general grade was very high.

I am feeling down when it comes to school. I am usually tired and uninterested at some lessons. When I need to do homework I can't write 15 minutes without checking my phone or PC. It is not like I don't find meaning in what I do, in fact I do. The problem is I am too tired to try. I had this feeling for like 2 years. I know I can do things, but I do them slower paced compared to others.

When I look at the future I am a little afraid that I see what hard path lies in front of me. Maybe it is just the age or a simple self-induced feeling. I have friends, but I have some problems in my family.

Edit: I don't think it is relevant, but I found out, after some medical analysis that I have a very slow metabolism, very close to the inferior normal limit. I always blamed that for my lack of energy.
