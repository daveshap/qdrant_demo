To my friends who suffer from anxiety in silence
Some days at work are great, and others.. not so much. I got my first job earlier this year, after years of dreading it. Here I am now, well liked at work by nearly everyone, making decent money (considering what I do), and financially helping my family. 

Despite everything generally being great, I still have days where I can’t help but take a few minutes to cry in the bathroom at work. I think I hide it pretty well, and I don’t think anyone at work knows what I mess I am sometimes. I don’t ever talk to anyone about my anxiety in depth, and there are likely a lot of people here who suffer in silence too. 

If anyone is reading this at work right now, maybe in the bathroom trying to pull yourself together (or anywhere really), I believe in you and I’m rooting for you! This community is so kind and supportive. I truly believe we are all so brave and courageous and I just wanted to send out a nice message to anyone who may need to hear it from someone but doesn’t have anyone in their life to talk to about their anxiety. 

Whether you’re overcoming a fear of talking to the cashier at the grocery store, or you’re scared to talk on the phone, or to leave your house, or maybe you’re like me and you’re just constantly shaky and worried for seemingly no reason but try to hold your head up high and carry on, I am so proud of you. Celebrate every little accomplishment and step you take. Because anxiety is so ugly and can be so debilitating, every little piece of success should be celebrated. 

I’m always here to chat if anyone needs a friend. I love this community so much. oo
