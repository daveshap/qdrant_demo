PICARD: You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
DOUGHERTY: ... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
PICARD: The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
DOUGHERTY: That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
PICARD: What kind of concerns?
DOUGHERTY: We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed. Dougherty out.
