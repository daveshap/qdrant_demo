BUD: Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
SHELDRAKE: And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
BUD: Sir?
SHELDRAKE: I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
BUD: You're going to take her off my hands?
SHELDRAKE: That's right. I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
BUD: You left your wife?
SHELDRAKE: Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
BUD: Yeah --
SHELDRAKE: Now what was your news, Baxter?
BUD: It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
SHELDRAKE: Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me. This way, Baxter.
