PIKE: Benny, man, where you been? You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
BENNY: Let me in.
PIKE: Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --
BENNY: Invite me in, Pike.
PIKE: Wait a minute. What's wrong with you, man?
BENNY: I'm fine.
PIKE: You look like shit, Benny.
BENNY: I... feel.... pretty.
PIKE: No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty. Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
BENNY: The sun! It burns! It burns!
BENNY: Let me in, Pike! I'm hungry!
PIKE: Get away from here.
BENNY: I'm hungry.
PIKE: I mean it.
