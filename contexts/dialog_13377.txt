EDDIE: Hello, Charlie... C'mon in... That's my girl.
CHARLIE: Hello, Eddie's girl... I looked all over for you.
EDDIE: Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
CHARLIE: I asked around.
SARAH: Do you want me to go?
EDDIE: No, stick around. Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
CHARLIE: Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
EDDIE: Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
CHARLIE: How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
EDDIE: So am I... Sit down. Would you get us a couple of drinks?
CHARLIE: You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners. He was like a... like --
EDDIE: A son.
CHARLIE: Yeah, yeah, like a son. I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy.""
EDDIE: Talk to me, Charlie.
CHARLIE: I want you to come back on the road with me.
EDDIE: Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
CHARLIE: What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
EDDIE: I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
CHARLIE: Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
EDDIE: Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
CHARLIE: This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back. What for? To take another beating?
EDDIE: I told you you'd get your money back.
CHARLIE: He thinks I care about the money. I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We're together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye? You gimme the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about you. This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames... Excuse me... I'll tell you what -- take her along.
