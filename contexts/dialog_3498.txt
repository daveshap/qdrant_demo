YOUNG MAN: And this is the study. You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
DUDE: Yes, uh, very impressive.
YOUNG MAN: Please, feel free to inspect them.
DUDE: I'm not really, uh.
YOUNG MAN: Please! Please!
DUDE: Uh-huh.
YOUNG MAN: That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
DUDE: Uh-huh.
YOUNG MAN: That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year! Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
DUDE: Hey, is this him with Nancy?
YOUNG MAN: That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
DUDE: Lebowski on the right?
YOUNG MAN: Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs. Reagan on the left, taken when--

YOUNG MAN: Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes. And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.

DUDE: I see.
YOUNG MAN: --without the means for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski has committed to sending all of them to college.
DUDE: Jeez. Think he's got room for one more?
YOUNG MAN: One--oh! Heh-heh. You never went to college?
DUDE: Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
YOUNG MAN: Heh-heh--
DUDE: --smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
YOUNG MAN: Yes, heh--
DUDE: --and bowling. I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez! Fuck me!
