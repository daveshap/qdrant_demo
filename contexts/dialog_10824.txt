DANA: They didn't find anything? In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing? So, what do I do now?
VENKMAN: Now you get dressed and we go out. I got a babysitter and everything. Trust me, you need it.
DANA: I'm not here to date. I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
VENKMAN: It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff. She's one of my most valuable employees.
DANA: Does she know anything about babies?
VENKMAN: Janine Melnitz, are you kidding? Do I have a vase? I brought some of your clothes. Wear something intriguing. I brought along some interesting possibilities.
DANA: Okay, but it's not a date. It's a dinner.
VENKMAN: Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
DANA: I put them in your hamper. I thought they were dirty.
VENKMAN: I have a hamper? Next time ask me first, okay. I have more than two grades of laundry. There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
