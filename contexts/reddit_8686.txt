The Arizona GOP, amongst others, has officially cancelled their 2020 primary. What consequences could arise from this?
[This article](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/460552-arizona-gop-opts-of-2020-nominating-contest) states that the GOP in Arizona, Kansas and South Carolina have all cancelled their primaries in 2020, meaning that Donald Trump will not be opposed in these states when seeking re-nomination for the party. Nevada has been named as another state which will reportedly follow suit.

Whilst this is not the first time that individual states have opted to cancel their primaries, with the same article stating that the Democratic Party in Arizona didnâ€™t hold primaries during the 2012 election, in the past did any consequences arise from this decision? Could the GOP be forced to hold primaries in these states by a legal challenge? 

Thanks.
