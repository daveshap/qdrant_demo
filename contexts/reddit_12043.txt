My girlfriend and my views are changing
I've been dating my girlfriend for about 3 years now, and we've always been generally interested in the same stuff. I'm 20 and she's 18 almost 19 and since she turned 18 she's been in a rush it seems to get all these tattoos and piercings and she moved out a week after she turned 18 because her mom has always been controlling. And I used to want all these pointless tattoos 2 years ago too but now I don't at all I only seem to want ones with great art and meaning not just get one to get it. And she has 5 or 6 already and keeps wanting to get more and I keep trying to tell her to wait and see if that's something she actually wants because they are permanent and she never listens. And now her friend has convinced her to get her nipples pierced and while its her body she can do what she wants I'm against the idea, but again its her choice. But I feel like we both just have completely different priorities and that I've grown out of that phase and she isn't going to and don't know what to do about it. Sorry for the wall of confusing text.
