PARRISH: What is there to say? They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
DREW: Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear. Now they want to do the same with theirs.
PARRISH: What are their feelings?
DREW: If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
PARRISH: Over my dead body.
DREW: What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
PARRISH: I don't care.
DREW: With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
PARRISH: Whose?
DREW: Yours.
PARRISH: I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
DREW: I'm just giving you the truth. There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
PARRISH: I think it's time you went home, Drew.
DREW: Certainly. Goodnight.
