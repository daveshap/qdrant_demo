KIRK: Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
SPOCK: I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
SPOCK: I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
KIRK: I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
SPOCK: And that is?
KIRK: Because it's there.
SPOCK: Ah, Captain?
KIRK: MM.?
SPOCK: I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
KIRK: On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
SPOCK: I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
SPOCK: Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
KIRK: Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
KIRK: Oh, God
SPOCK: Perhaps because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain."
