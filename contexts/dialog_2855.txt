OSBORNE: So what now?
HARDY: Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
OSBORNE: Think it'll work?
HARDY: Nah.
OSBORNE: You know, you never told me why you left the army.
HARDY: It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
OSBORNE: For what?
HARDY: That's gonna stay my secret.
OSBORNE: We were close to something with Kendall.
HARDY: Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries. I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
OSBORNE: No.
HARDY: Good, just making sure.
