TIN MAN: ...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
DOROTHY: Oh...
TIN MAN: Oh --
DOROTHY: ...Oh, did that hurt?
TIN MAN: No -- it feels wonderful. I've held that axe up for ages. Oh ---
DOROTHY: Oh, goodness! How did you ever get like this?
TIN MAN: Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
TIN MAN: ...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid. And I've been that way ever since.
DOROTHY: Well, you're perfect now.
TIN MAN: My...my neck. My...my neck. Perfect? Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect. Go ahead -- bang on it!
DOROTHY: Oh --!
SCARECROW: Beautiful! What an echo!
TIN MAN: It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
