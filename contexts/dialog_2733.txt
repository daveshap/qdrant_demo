CHEVALIER: I have no luggage.
PRUSSIAN OFFICER: The gentleman has nothing contraband.
CHEVALIER: Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
RODERICK: Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital. I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
