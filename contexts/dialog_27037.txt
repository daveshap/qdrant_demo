ED: What you gonna do, man? You gonna go to the cops?
WILSON: Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
ED: Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball. Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ... Those curves don't kid around.
ED: You should talk to Elaine. That was her best friend.
WILSON: She didn't write to me, did she.
ED: She didn't know what to say. I thought someone should say something. To someone. With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason. I felt like I owed her.
WILSON: Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
ED: Not me, man. I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
WILSON: I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
ED: I already told you, man. Corcoran. Know what that is? State prison.
WILSON: Nick's a nick, n' it? No matter what state you're in. State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
ED: But that's not me anymore. That's when I was into the gang lifestyle. That's not who I am now. Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
