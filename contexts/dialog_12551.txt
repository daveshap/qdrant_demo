PHIL: What?
JULIE: You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
PHIL: What's that?
JULIE: This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
PHIL: Stop knowing me so well.
JULIE: I know it's at the high end of our range --
PHIL: High end? Honey, it's a whole new budget.
JULIE: But it's what we want.
PHIL: You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
JULIE: They don't expect to get what they're asking. Let's make an offer.
PHIL: You want me to bargain at the high end of our range? -- I'll have a stroke. I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
JULIE: You could have a pool to cool off in.
PHIL: It's a nice pool, isn't it?
JULIE: And it's a shorter commute.
PHIL: It'll be even shorter if I get that new job. Come on.
