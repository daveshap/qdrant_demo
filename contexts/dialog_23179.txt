DETECTIVE KINCAID: The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
SIDNEY: Why didn't you tell me? This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
DEWEY: I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know, trick you out of hiding.
SIDNEY: Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
DETECTIVE KINCAID: Are you sure?
SIDNEY: Absolutely.
DEWEY: Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
SIDNEY: Mm, what a waste of Silicone. What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
SIDNEY: Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
GALE: Who's this.
DEWEY: Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
SIDNEY: She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
