MICHAEL: Well, he isn't. Nice...real nice.
CHARLIE: He'll be here. Look, take this for now.
MICHAEL: You kiddin. The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
CHARLIE: How much was the original loan again?
MICHAEL: $500. He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
CHARLIE: $3,000. Shit! Can we hold it at $3,000?
MICHAEL: Charlie, this is business.
CHARLIE: 'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
MICHAEL: I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
CHARLIE: 'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
MICHAEL: He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
CHARLIE: 'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
MICHAEL: You said it.
