Are men really into girls who act "hard to get" even if they are interested in him too?
Personally I have never met a man who claimed this was the case in my entire life. I'm a guy and have had honest guy talks with about 30~ friends over the years from varying circumstances and backgrounds and all of them actually seem to think that being "easy to get" is actually a more attractive trait so long as it's exclusive to you (i.e., not slutty)
