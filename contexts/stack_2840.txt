Invisible energy in hadronic calorimeters Hadronic calorimeters are more difficult to be built than electromagnetic ones because the cascade containment is much larger for former. There is also some \"invisible\" energy that is not contained in the detector (and therefore not measured). This invisible energy is carried by neutrons not detected in the calorimeters and other particles/processes. I would like to know if somebody could point me which particles might be carrying this invisible energies or in which processes it might be loss and not measured
