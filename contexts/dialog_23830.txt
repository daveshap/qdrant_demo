JACK: Don't come over the top. Stay still.
MILES: Shut up.
JACK: Just trying to be helpful. It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
MILES: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
JACK: Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile. Here.
MILES: What is it?
JACK: I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
