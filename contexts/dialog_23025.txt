GESTAPO: Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
SCHINDLER: I'm sorry to hear that.
GESTAPO: There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
SCHINDLER: I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back. I have to leave.
SCHINDLER: All right, okay, let's talk.
GESTAPO: In Breslau.
SCHINDLER: Breslau? I can't go to Breslau. Not now.
