Is the recruiter trying to tell me something? Has the position been filled?
I couple of weeks ago a recruiter contacted me about a job in another country.  I was told I would be brought in to support the legal team for six months or a year . I was excited because it honestly sounded like exactly what I have been looking for and asked that he put me forward for the role.  He calls me to discuss the salary before putting me forward and says he’d be I touch in about a week. Two weeks pass and I hear Nothing so I reach out to ask for an updated and I’m told that the initial review has been positive but we are just waiting for the hiring manager to return.  

Earlier in the week I call and I’m told there’s still no news but then all of the sudden a day later I’m told they want me for a shorter time to start with but are also evaluating an internal candidate.  The next day I call the recruiter to clarify what they mean and I’m told “ they don’t know what they want” .


Should I forget about this job
