KRINGELEIN: Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
BARON: Yes, quite.
KRINGELEIN: We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
DOCTOR: Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
KRINGELEIN: Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
BARON: I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
KRINGELEIN: In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
BARON: Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
DOCTOR: No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
KRINGELEIN: Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
ZINNOWITZ: ...and let me say again for the tenth time... ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
GERSTENKORN: I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
PREYSING: Evil days -- I've shown you here -- -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
GERSTENKORN: Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
PREYSING: What?
SCHWEIMANN: Shall I tell them again?
GERSTENKORN: Why waste time -- it's getting late.
SCHWEIMANN: You see -- what we are interested in --
GERSTENKORN: Ah, come on -- we're going home.
ZINNOWITZ: Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
GERSTENKORN: You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
GERSTENKORN: Sorry, Preysing.
PREYSING: You've decided against the merger?
GERSTENKORN: Yes --
PREYSING: Then, it's all over?
GERSTENKORN: Yes --
