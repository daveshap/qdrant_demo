DONNIE: I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
SOLOMON: -- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
DONNIE: I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
SOLOMON: FUCK YOU. I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down. I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
DONNIE: I paid you back.
SOLOMON: Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
DONNIE: Solomon, please. Please. I am so fucked here if you do this. This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working. I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming --
AVI: What surery?
DONNIE: Oral surgery. Corrective teeth surgery.
SOLOMON: What is that?
DONNIE: Braces.
SOLOMON: Braces?
DONNIE: Yes.
SOLOMON: You don't need braces.
DONNIE: Yes I do.
SOLOMON: Your teeth are fine.
AVI: Your teeth are straight.
DONNIE: I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
AVI: Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
DONNIE: I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what? Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
AVI: How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
DONNIE: I don't know.
SOLOMON: And how much is braces?
