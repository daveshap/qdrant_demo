ANNIE: Oh, hi! Did you find her all right?
MELANIE: Yes, I did.
MELANIE: I was wondering...
ANNIE: Yes?
MELANIE: That sign. Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
ANNIE: Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
MELANIE: I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
ANNIE: Sure. You can have it. Where's your bag? In the car?
ANNIE: It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
MELANIE: I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
ANNIE: Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
