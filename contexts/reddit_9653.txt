Tuition waivers for Master's programs
Hi everyone!

I'm a rising undergraduate senior, and I've been considering getting my master's in student affairs with the hopes of working in career development or academic advising. After talking to people in the profession at my university (and reading posts on this sub), I've decided I don't think I want to go to a program that doesn't waive tuition for their graduate assistants. I know that a lot of programs do this, so I wasn't too worried before, but because of the financial hits that universities are taking because of the pandemic and hiring freezes happening, I was wondering how likely it is that schools will still be able to offer tuition waivers for incoming students that would start in Fall 2021. I know that everything is very up in the air, so it's likely that people don't have the answers to that yet, but I don't want to get my hopes up too high if it looks like tuition waivers are going to become a lot less common. 

Any information about this would be a huge help! Thanks!
