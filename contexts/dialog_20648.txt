CAROL: Charlie really has a great voice.
MADDY: Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
PEGGY: Don't get your hopes up.
MADDY: Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
PEGGY: He is kind of cute, isn't he?
CAROL: Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
PEGGY: He does?
DOLORES: Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
PEGGY: First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
DOLORES: God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
PEGGY: Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
DOLORES: Are you for real?
PEGGY: Touchy, touchy!
