My friends having a good time is driving me to suicide
I know how stupid it sounds, but their lives are getting better and better and mine is slipping from my hands. I was feeling fine until a couple of days ago, then i saw them after a long time and they're just having fun, being social, meeting new people and being awesome all around. Meanwhile i get panic attacks in public at the thought of having to speak to someone.  
After seeing them socialize i just lost all hope, all my efforts don't matter if i'm too awkward to do anything with the results,the thought of having to see functional people like them again is making me crave death more and more .  
And nobody is gonna read this cause it's a a wall of text from a socially inept wreck, if you're on this subreddit i suppose it's cause you're going trough something aswell, i hope everything gets better for you
