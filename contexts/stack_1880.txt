Word for a place where knowledge is shared I am looking for a word that represents a place where knowledge is shared. Words like academy or school convey the idea of one-way sharing (from teachers/instructors to students), and I want something where everybody shares knowledge, preferably technical.The proposed usage is to brand a group where people will meet to share knowledge (and anyone can be a teacher at any given time).Any ideas?Thanks!
