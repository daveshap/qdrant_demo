Preserve app data when moving to new Apple ID (complication: can't log in to old Apple ID) I need to set up a new phone with a new Apple ID for a friend. We're facing two technical problems: We need to preserve some data from the old phone (specifically, the WhatsApp chat log). We don't know the password to the Apple ID the old phone is linked to.Current situation: We have the old phone (associated with the old account), and we have successfully updated it to the latest iOS version and backed it up via iTunes. The old phone does not have iCloud services/backup activated. We have the new phone (factory reset), updated to the same iOS version (11.2.2).I was able to successfully restore the backup to the new phone. However, in order to install the apps (and thus access their data) from the old phone, they need to be downloaded with the old Apple ID, for which we don't have the password (and no way of resetting it either).If I bind the phone to the new Apple ID, I have to delete and reinstall WhatsApp, so the chat logs will be gone. Is there any way to back them up and restore them to the new ID (the phone number/SIM card remains the same)?
