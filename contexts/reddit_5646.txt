[Looking] looking for a remote computer job
Hey ðŸ‘‹ ,

Looking for a remote job Preferably with computers. University starts September 21st, however I need work until then and preferably a part time job whilst at uni.

Iâ€™ve hnc in computing, hnd in computer science and cisco ITN in router and switching. 

Please, if anyone hears of anything that is real work and not surveys then let me know, even if itâ€™s just finding lost passwords or basic Wordpress sites with logins etc
