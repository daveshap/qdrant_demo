How do you deal with edits to a manuscript by your advisor without drowning your inner voice in it?
My question as a PhD student is related to an experience I had dealing with a recent manuscript where the initial version of the paper was edited heavily by my advisor who removed bunch of stuff I wrote. When it went for the reviewers, they were asking about something’s in the paper which was some stuff that was edited out by the advisor. Such as I had a paragraph on why we did x, but he/her removed it. Then a reviewer said the paper lacks information why we did x. Granted some of edits he/her makes are helpful since I’m still mastering the art. But how do you handle such a situation?
