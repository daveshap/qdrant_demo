FRANÇOIS: I wanted to say goodbye to you.
GASTON: Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba.
FRANÇOIS: But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
GASTON: No.
FRANÇOIS: You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
GASTON: No ... Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
FRANÇOIS: No.
GASTON: Amsterdam?
FRANÇOIS: No.
GASTON: Constantinople?
FRANÇOIS: No.
GASTON: You've never been in Constantinople?
FRANÇOIS: No!
GASTON: But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
FRANÇOIS: Yes!
GASTON: Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
FRANÇOIS: But--
GASTON: I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
FRANÇOIS: And harems ... ?
GASTON: <u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
