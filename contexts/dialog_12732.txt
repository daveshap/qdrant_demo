BRENNA: What's all that?
TAUPIN: Richard Taupin has become cumbersome. It would be best if he just disappeared.
BRENNA: You did kill those men.
TAUPIN: Not all of them.
BRENNA: When you finish, what then?
TAUPIN: I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
BRENNA: You make it all sound so simple.
TAUPIN: The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired. That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg. But that's where you come in.
BRENNA: You want me to front for you.
TAUPIN: The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better. You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
