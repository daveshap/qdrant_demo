How should you act if you have a lot of experience at a job, but are treated as a newbie?
Hello, I just started a new job. I have 5+ years in the industry including management experience. I'm at a new job, but they treat me like a complete newbie, so i've just been "ok ok ok" everything, like I know everything i'm being taught and I know the work because i've done it for years for multiple companies. I understand that it's gonna take time to build up trust, so i'm just being super humble and not really saying "i know i know i know" all I say is "oh yeah i've done this before. it's really familiar." Is this normal?
