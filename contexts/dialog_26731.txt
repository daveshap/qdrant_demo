TRENT: Who? Rob?
MIKE: Yeah. You met him once.
TRENT: Yeah. He's a rounder"."
SUE: What's he do?
MIKE: He's trying to be an actor.
TRENT: What a surprise...
SUE: ...How novel.
ROB: So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
MIKE: To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
ROB: Oh. Where is this place?
MIKE: It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
ROB: That doesn't sound too good for business.
MIKE: It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
ROB: Sounds more like Aids...
MIKE: ...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
MIKE: Kinda money, huh?
ROB: Classy.
MIKE: I'll get a Dewars rocks...
ROB: Bud.
MIKE: ...A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud, please.
ROB: I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
MIKE: I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
ROB: Darwinism at its best.
MIKE: I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
ROB: It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
MIKE: Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
ROB: I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
MIKE: Ah, there's the rub...
ROB: There's the rub.
