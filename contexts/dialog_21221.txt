DAVID: Don't get upset.
DICK VAN DYKE: Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know. I don't think I better talk about this right now.
DAVID: Where are you going ...
DICK VAN DYKE: I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
DAVID: WAIT A MINUTE!!
DICK VAN DYKE: Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
DAVID: COME BACK!!!
DAVID: Oh God.
JENNIFER: What's going to happen?
DAVID: I don't know ... It's not possible ... Is it possible?
BETTY: Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
DAVID: It can't be possible.
