Grades
I'm a junior and I just got two B's this semester. I had one B last year and now, I'm very worried I won't be able to go to the college my parents want me to go to (which is a very good Stem school and would be the most convenient). I don't really do many extracurriculars so I'm really just banking on my grades and now I'm very anxious.
