MULLIGAN: Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
SPATS: Go where?
MULLIGAN: A little country club we run for retired bootleggers. I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
SPATS: I never join nothin'.
MULLIGAN: You'll like it there. I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
SPATS: Big joke. Who's the rap this time?
MULLIGAN: Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
SPATS: Me? I'm just a customer here.
MULLIGAN: Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint. Mozarella is just fronting for you.
SPATS: Mozarella? Never heard of him.
MULLIGAN: We got different information.
SPATS: From who? Toothpick Charlie, maybe?
MULLIGAN: Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.
