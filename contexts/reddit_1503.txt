My cancer might be back :(
This is just a venting post because I have no other place to rant.

 I was diagnosed with cancer in 2015 and reached remission in 2016. Never dealt with mental health until I was diagnosed with the disease. Right after my remission I would get slightly anxious about every single change about my body, without realizing that cancer affect the body tremendously. My doctor tried to make me seek some consultation regarding my anxiety but I refused. 

Time past by and I was simply living. Never had any worries or issue that would trick my anxiety until last month. I noticed I have been losing some weight. It wasn't a lot, but I still have been losing weight which made me anxious. Weight loss was one of my first symptoms of cancer. My anxiety was spiraling and I just kept losing weight. I investigated my body and my neck of any nodes. I had a node on my right neck when I was diagnosed with cancer. Couldn't find any so my mind settled a little bit and I finally gained about 1 pound. 3 days ago I was randomly touching my neck and I found two swollen lymp node. My anxiety went from 0-100 in a couple of minutes. 

For the past days I have been crying and shaking. I'm almost convinced that my cancer is back. I have an appointment with my doctor next week. I just want to get it over with. I'm hoping and praying that its not cancer, but the chance is really really slim.
Can't even look at my mother's face without thinking that I will probably break her heart soon. She was my main support in all this. I saw how mentally draining it was for her and now we need to do it all over again. 

I have been standing on the scale for about 5 times a day to see if my weight changing. Yesterday while I was going to sleep, I pinched my node so hard out of frustration. 

I'm just a mess right now..
