AP Computer Science is drowning me
I am a high school senior this year and I'm trying to escape AP Computer Science. The class is rigorous, the teacher is not great, and I'm falling behind. I have no idea what's going on in this class and I'm very anxious that I will fail because I'm so behind. I'm taking a test today that was only announced two days ago and I think I will fail it. My classmates seem to have no problems with the material because they have backgrounds in programming. I only took a basic programming class last year and I did fine with it and I thought I'd really enjoy this class. I really don't, I hate it! Computer Science was even my intended major for college, but I'm not so sure what to do with my life. I'm falling behind because of my own goddamned laziness and the fact that I hate this class! I really want to switch to regular Computer Science so I can slow down, but none of my classes will let me switch and the one out of the two classes are completely full. If I try to switch to another class, I feel I would be too far behind since the other classes are already a month in. I don't know what to do about this because I'm so behind and I understand absolutely nothing about what we're learning! Fuck it, seriously fuck this! What should I do?! I feel so lost and alone.
