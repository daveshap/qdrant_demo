MAURICE: Jimmy Bones?
PATRICK: Yeah, you heard of him?
MAURICE: You haven't?
PATRICK: Not that I remember.
MAURICE: He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone...""
PATRICK: I was born near here. My dad's from here. He never mentioned it.
BILL: Bones! How baddass is zat? This is the place for us. Patrick, you get platinum props, man. Platinum.
MAURICE: Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
BILL: What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
MAURICE: Look around, this place is a dump! Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
PATRICK: You gotta use your imagination.
MAURICE: This is Patrick..." "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination
PATRICK: Why don't y'all check out the rest? I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up. Warm this place up, you'll see. It has serious potential.
MAURICE: Potential toxic dump site.
BILL: Are you nuts?
MAURICE: The man said just to use my imagination. Let's see...yeah, I get it. Potential. I can see it now. The first major urban theme park. Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials. Totally E-ticket.
BILL: Keep smokin', fool.
