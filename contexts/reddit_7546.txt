How much prior knowledge does it take for a Master's in Business Analytics?
I am a Political Science undergraduate and I took my electives in Economics, Data Science and Business.
Due to that I will be admitted for a Master's in Economic and Business Analytics. Do you think it will be hard for me, succeeding in this Program without majoring in Economics or Business? I don't need excellent grades, just want to make sure that this Master is doable for me.

The program starts with a few basic courses in Economics, Business and Analytic Methods (Econometrics, Data Mining etc). After that you can specialize in a few areas and I guess I would go for Analytic Methods and Digital Economy.
