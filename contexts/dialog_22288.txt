COMMENTATOR #1: We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
COMMENTATOR #2: Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
COMMENTATOR #1: I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
COMMENTATOR #2: You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
COMMENTATOR #1: Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
COMMENTATOR #2: It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
COMMENTATOR #1: I agree.
