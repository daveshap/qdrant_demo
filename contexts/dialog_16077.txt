RAY: You sure it was him?
CLAUDE: Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
RAY: I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
CLAUDE: We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
RAY: I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
WILKINS: Lemonade?
PIKE: I prefer bourbon.
WILKINS: I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
PIKE: Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
WILKINS: Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
PIKE: You don't have to twist my arm. Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
WILKINS: Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
CLAUDE: Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
WILKINS: Goodnight, Claude.
PIKE: If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
WILKINS: I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
PIKE: Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
WILKINS: If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
