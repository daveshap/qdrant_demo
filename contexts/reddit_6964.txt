Anyone ever been let go in a group?
I worked for a small company and not long after I accepted my position I realized that we had a TON of employee turnover and the company had numerous financial issues. I continued to look for positions but before I found a new one I was one of 3 people (approx 20%) of our workforce who was let go, as a group. No private meetings or discussions. Our senior project manager was largely MIA throughout the holidays and then announced he would not be returning for at least 3 mos if at all. This meant that outstanding projects were not being completed and could not be collected on so no income was coming in. After 10 days they let the three of us go. I was astounded about the manner of them doing it en masse. Has this happened to anyone else? Outright bizarre. Needless to say, there was no severance or anything. I had only been there about 2 1/2 months so I have basically no money after rent and some bills but I'm not eligible for unemployment because I wasn't in the position for a whole quarter. I am interviewing but nothing yet and trying to get a local job in a restaurant or shop to hep has been a no go as people think I'm overqualified or (bartender) underqualified. What to do? I still have to eat and commute to interviews and pay keep the phone, lights and internet on the rest of the month...
