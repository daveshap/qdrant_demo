Option: I’ll let you know if I have time. Priority: I’ll make time.
I’ve been casually dating for a few months now and taking a slow approach to it. I know people are busy between jobs, parenting, hobbies and everyday life. But, that doesn’t mean you can’t put ANY
 effort into dating if it’s a priority to you. Sometimes it’s the little things that count! 

For example, connected with one guy via OLD and a month had gone by and still no date. He was always “busy” at work, with his kid, but would be snap chatting him by the pool or out and about lol. Final straw was when we had a date set up (finally) I ask for a time around 10 a.m and his response was “I’ll let you know, I’m school shopping for my kid”. I get a text at 8:30 pm asking if I’m ready. No thanks. 

Fast forward to the guy I’m seeing now. Also very busy, works 12 hour shifts and coparents but we have had two dates within three weeks, we talk on the phone a few times a week, text sporadically through the day. When he has his kid I don’t blow his phone up, and vice versa (I coparent as well). The big difference is we prioritize that time. He sometimes falls asleep on the phone and I think it’s adorable. Last night, before telling me goodnight he apologized for the nights he falls asleep without telling me. *insert big cheesy smile*. Third date is a late dinner which I don’t usually do but I’m compromising due to him getting off work late. (Priority)

The moral of the story is, if someone is a priority to you, make time for them. No one likes to feel like they are simply an option. The End.
