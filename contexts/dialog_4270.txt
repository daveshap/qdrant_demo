CARDENAS: Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
DR. PALEY: At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
CARDENAS: Did you ever see her again after that?
DR. PALEY: Yes -- several times.
CARDENAS: What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
DR. PALEY: We stopped seeing each other.
CARDENAS: Why?
DR. PALEY: Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me. She was just trying to get information out of me.
CARDENAS: What kind of information?
DR. PALEY: She said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart.
CARDENAS: Did you suggest any?
DR. PALEY: Yes -- Insulin and others.
CARDENAS: What did she say?
DR. PALEY: She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned. She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
CARDENAS: -- And what did you suggest?
DR. PALEY: Cocaine.
