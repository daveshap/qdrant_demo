RANDAL: What's he looking for?
DANTE: He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
RANDAL: Perfect dozen.
DANTE: Each egg has to be perfect.
RANDAL: The quest isn't going well?
DANTE: Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
RANDAL: Why doesn't he just mix and match?
DANTE: I told him that and he yelled at me.
RANDAL: What did he say?
DANTE: He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
RANDAL: It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
DANTE: I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
