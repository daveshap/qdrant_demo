JACK: Dead serious.
GILLETTE: You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men. You'll never make it out of the bay.
JACK: We'll see about that.
GILLETTE: Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
JACK: Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
GILLETTE: Agreed. You have the momentary advantage, sir. But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
JACK: As likely as not. Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
