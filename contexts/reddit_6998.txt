Was let go due to financial cutbacks. They aren’t paying out unused vacation. Some states require it. How do I find out if my state does?
I was let go from my job today due to financial cutbacks. It really sucks as I loved this job. Great pay, benefits, work, and people. Best job I have ever had, but they company is in financial straits and left go 4 people in our main branch last month and myself and a couple other people in our branch today. 

They are giving me a severance and paying out my accumulated PTO but I still have around 60 hours of unused PTO. I did a bit of research and read that some states require unused PTO to be paid out. The HQ of my company is in Minnesota but the branch I work at is in Nebraska and they usually push everything through Minnesota regulations. Anyone know where I can find out if I am owed my unused PTO or not? I don’t think my company would try to screw me over, but they are a smallish company and only have one HR person so I can see this being overlooked. Thanks for any and all help!
