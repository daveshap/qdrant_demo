My spouse (22f) has been out of the workforce for several years and is unsure about how to make her resume look good.
My wife has been unemployed since 2016 due to wanting to focus 100% on undergrad school work. Having a one income household has certainly affected us a lot over the years, and just continues to put pressure on us when it comes to our bills and other expenses. 

She is wanting to get back into the workforce soon (probably part time) while she continues with her digital media/animation degree. Unfortunately, her resume is looking a little empty due to this long gap of unemployment. Her last job was a temporary position in 2016.

Are there any ways to make her resume look good while not having a lot of job experience? She is definitely a hard worker, an A/B student, and is willing to do what it takes to help out our family. It sucks that jobs won't take that into consideration when looking at her resume just because she's had to take a break from working for school.
