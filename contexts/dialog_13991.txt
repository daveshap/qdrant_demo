JIMMY: Wow. Look at the mountains.
DAD: This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
JIMMY: Is the hill ours too?
DAD: If we want it, it is.
JIMMY: Let's check it out, Dad.
JIMMY: Wow. There's the town. And there's the air base. This is a great hill.
DAD: It's got a name. Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
JIMMY: Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
