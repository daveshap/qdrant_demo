About to start my College Counseling & Student Development program. Advice that will help me look good for future employers?
A bit about my background:
- I am coming into my grad program with experience in residence life, academic advising, and peer academic advising from my undergrad university. I had an internship for 2 summers at a school working with advising Masters & PhD students. 

- I am on the board of directors for a college professionals association- I help plan events and our annual conference.

- My assistantship on campus is in the advising & student transitions center. 

Keeping all of these in mind, what do you recommend I do to set myself to succeed and stand out (in the right way) once I start applying for jobs? I have been reading some other threads on this sub saying the field is extremely competitive and I want to make sure I am setting myself up for success in the field post-graduation. Any advice will help.

End goal: Academic advisor at a public, large 4-year institution. I live in Minnesota and am willing to go anywhere the work is.
