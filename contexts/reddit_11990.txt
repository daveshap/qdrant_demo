How can I accept the life that awaits me?
This is gonna be awfully long, I understand if you don't want to read this. You can scroll ahead.

I like to think I'm aware of what's waiting for me ahead. I'm 22, I dropped out of school, I've never worked and I've been isolating myself for the past 5 years... there's no way I'll have a decent life.

&#x200B;

I say isolate, but that's not entirely true.

&#x200B;

I live with my family and I don't have a room so I'm alone only in the bathroom. I even go outside with a friend, even if it is only 5 or 6 times a year, attend the local cosplay con once a year and go to my father's for some days twice a year.

&#x200B;

The fact is, I can't even show how I feel for one moment. I can't be honest with my family so I'm faking happiness, without even doing it right, and that's kinda tiring. 

I could be honest with my friend, but she has a lot of problem of her own so I don't wanna burden her with mine, she can't even help me so I'd just make her worry.

At the con and with my father is even worse. I don't really know how to approach people, so I kinda have created a fake personality to exhibit in such occasions, but people try to befriend me and I'm not strong enough to stop them so I just let myself be dragged... after the con reality hits back, I lose contact with those I met and feel incredibly shitty about myself as a result, thus my self hate keeps growing.

&#x200B;

As for my father, I've piled up a huge number of lies and the only way to not make everything crumble is to keep lying... I do feel bad doing it to my father but there's no way back, I even told him I graduated from high school! As things stand now, I can't go and casually say I've told him a bunch of bullshit for years and that my life is actually shit but I'm fully aware that one day everything will be destroyed...

&#x200B;

The solution to all my problems, even partly those with my father, is far too known to me: go out and work.

&#x200B;

Sadly in my country even to clean the stairs they want an high school degree, that cuts me off from about 90% of the jobs, and that's just the least of my problems.

&#x200B;

I'm paralized by fear, so there's no way I can just go out and work. I'm scared of changing the fragile balance that's created in my house and, since what I'm afraid the most is confrontation with other people, the only thought of doing something that's different from my usual routine terrifies me.

&#x200B;

The other problem I have is that I can't bear the thought of spending my life doing something I hate. I know I'll never have my dream job and that I'm far too miserable and ugly to find a lover, but if i leave those out what's left?

In the best case I'll get a job I'll hate that makes me scrape through life until retirement, when I'll be too tired and empty to do anything but wait for death quietly.

In the most realistic scenario I'm just gonna have to nurse my relatives all my life and live off their money like a parasyte.

&#x200B;

The fear problem is gonna solve itself, for better or worse, in a few months when I'll move in another city and my family will kick my ass towards employement, and since I'm a spineless coward, I'm gonna quietly obey.

The other one still remains though, how can I accept the shitty life that awaits me? I've already crushed my dream, suffocated my hopes and negated my wishes, but it worked only partly and didn't even resolve a thing, it just hurts a lot.

&#x200B;

I'm gonna ask all those of you that have experienced life more than me, is there a way to accept life? Am I just automatically stop thinking about it while working my ass off? Should I keep destroying myself by exposing me to all that stuff I've been avoiding because it hurts until I'm an empty shell? (By the way, the last one is what I'm currently doing)

&#x200B;

Before you reply therapy or something similar, that's not an option. That would man face my family and there's no way I can do it. Online therapy also isn't an option, as I said before I can't really hide stuff in my house, even for writing this I had to leave another browser page in background to switch to.

&#x200B;

If you fear I might commit suicide don't worry. I am depressed and suicidal, but I'm not gonna end my suffering to make more people suffer, I'd rather keep the pain for myself.

Thanks for staying with me for this gigantic rant, kudos for your patience. I usually don't say how I feel online, as it makes me feel like I'm looking for somebody to pity me and that makes me hate myself even more, but since life's gonna hit me soon I thought I might've asked for once.
