SEBASTIAN: Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
BLAINE: - none taken -
SEBASTIAN: - wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
BLAINE: Any ideas who it could be?
SEBASTIAN: Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
BLAINE: Where did you say she's from?
SEBASTIAN: Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
BLAINE: Greg McConnell.
SEBASTIAN: The football stud?
BLAINE: He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
SEBASTIAN: It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
BLAINE: I don't think that bothered him.
SEBASTIAN: What do you mean?
BLAINE: Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
SEBASTIAN: Are you shitting me?
BLAINE: I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know - What are you doing
SEBASTIAN: Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
BLAINE: Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
SEBASTIAN: Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
BLAINE: Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
SEBASTIAN: Outstanding.
BLAINE: Don't think it's not going to cost you.
SEBASTIAN: No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the stroke of midnight" no pun intended?"
KATHRYN: So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
CECILE: He's alright. He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
KATHRYN: Really? Bulimic headcase.
CECILE: What a loser she must be. Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
KATHRYN: That's great.
CECILE: You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
KATHRYN: What are you scared of?
CECILE: Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
KATHRYN: Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
CECILE: Eww. No. That's gross.
KATHRYN: It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
CECILE: Are you for real?
KATHRYN: Do you want to learn or not?
CECILE: I guess. It still sounds gross.
KATHRYN: See that wasn't so bad.
CECILE: It was nothing.
KATHRYN: Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
CECILE: Okay.
KATHRYN: Eyes closed.
CECILE: That was cool.
KATHRYN: Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
CECILE: What are you saying?
KATHRYN: Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
CECILE: Is it that obvious?
KATHRYN: That's so romantic. Have you responded?
CECILE: No.
KATHRYN: Well do you like him?
CECILE: I don't know.
KATHRYN: Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
CECILE: I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
KATHRYN: Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
CECILE: Okay.
KATHRYN: Did you hide the letters?
CECILE: Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
KATHRYN: I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
CECILE: Why?
KATHRYN: Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
CECILE: You'd do that for me?
KATHRYN: Of course I would. We're friends, right?
CECILE: Best friends.
ANNETTE: Excuse me. Excuse me!
SEBASTIAN: You talking to me?
ANNETTE: Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
SEBASTIAN: What'cha reading?
ANNETTE: The Fountainhead.
SEBASTIAN: Great book.
ANNETTE: You've read The Fountainhead?
SEBASTIAN: Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
ANNETTE: Romantic? He rapes her.
SEBASTIAN: That's a matter of opinion.
ANNETTE: You need help.
SEBASTIAN: Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
ANNETTE: At this hour? I don't think so.
SEBASTIAN: Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
ANNETTE: Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
SEBASTIAN: Please.
ANNETTE: Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
SEBASTIAN: Thank you.
KATHRYN: Fuck her yet?
SEBASTIAN: I'm working on it.
KATHRYN: Loser.
SEBASTIAN: Blow me.
KATHRYN: Call me later.
SEBASTIAN: Okay.
