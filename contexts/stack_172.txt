Why does iOS 11.3.1 insist on reinstalling its defaults apps Since yesterday, my iOS 11.3.1 (on an iPhone SE) is in a strange, beforehand unseen state whereby most of its default apps apparently  have become uninstalled somehow (for instance, Maps and Videos are marked with the Cloud-like download item) and iOS proceeds with downloading them from somewhere (hopefully/presumably Apple) anew when I click on their icons (has e.g. happened with Notes and Podcast so far.)I am wondering: Is this a known phenomenon? For what reason does iOS enter into such a state?
