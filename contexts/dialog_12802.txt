HILDY: Have you got my dough?
LOUIS: Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
HILDY: Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
LOUIS: All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
HILDY: Come on with that money!
LOUIS: First you got to sign a receipt.
HILDY: Where's the money?
LOUIS: Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here. One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
HILDY: Here!
LOUIS: Thanks. So long, Hildy!
HILDY: So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
LOUIS: Huh?
HILDY: None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
LOUIS: Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
HILDY: You know it is!
LOUIS: I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
HILDY: No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
LOUIS: What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
