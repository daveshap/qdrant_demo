A guy burped on me
In school yesterday a guy in my class burped on me when we were entering the classroom. I found it quite schocking because we don’t know eachother very well but he really came up to me and just burped close to face. I didn’t know how to react so I just laughed. Today a day after the incident after thinking about it is really weird. What does it mean? What was he trying to do? Am I supposed to burp back?
