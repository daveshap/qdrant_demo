I want to go back to school and I'm not sure where to start. Any advice on which path I should take?
 

**Quick background:** I'm from Maryland and I just graduated with a *less than useful* undergraduate degree about a month ago. I honestly don't even want to say what it is... I hate the stigma of calling any degree useless, but I think it truly is useless to me with the new goals I have in mind (even *without* the current pandemic I graduated into). After hearing horror stories about my job prospects without the proper education, I want to get a head-start on bettering my situation before going through years of no job opportunity dry-spells post-graduation.

Currently, through a personal connection, I was lucky enough to get hired to do some at-home part time administrative and graphic design work for a local business. I want to take advantage of this period + the limited mobility I have due to COVID-19 to get some **online** schooling done. My ultimate goal is to break into **Human Resources.**

I can't decide if I should:

**1) Get a second bachelor's degree and pretend the first one never happened.** After doing some research, it shouldn't take another 4 whole years to earn another Bachelor's due to my accumulated credits.

**2) Go for a postgraduate degree.** I've been told that earning a second bachelors isn't the best use of time and money and that I might as well go for my Master's in a more productive field? My concern is that I'm not sure if I have the qualifications to be accepted into a Master's program in my new chosen field . My current degree isn't all that transferable to different subjects :(

**3) Go for certification programs.** This might be the quickest way to make myself a little more marketable. It might make it easier to find entry level jobs and internships I want in my new field. And I can always pursue my Master's at a later time.

**4) Go for an Associates degree.** Just another option, but I'm not sure if this will be more or less helpful than pursuing certifications.

Of course I'm still going to be applying for jobs, learning more helpful skills, and crossing my fingers on my own time (I'm also juggling trying to get my driver's license right now).

But I would appreciate any advice on what would be the best way to dedicate my overall time. I don't want to make the same mistakes again. My family is getting older, and I wish to be able to give back to them some day soon.

**TLDR;**

**I'm a recent graduate. I have a "useless" degree. I want to do some online schooling/training to better my prospects and break into HR. All of the schooling I'm considering will have to be** **ONLINE.** **There are various routes I'm thinking of taking. I don't know which option will be the most productive. Any advice would be much appreciated!**

(Additional Info - I managed to graduate debt free and I have quite a chunk of money in my savings. I'm not *too* worried about the cost of the online schooling because I know it'll be worth it. But if you have any affordable, *cost-effective* online-program recommendations, I would absolutely love to hear them. I am still trying to buy a car in the very near future after all, haha!)

Thanks in advance!
