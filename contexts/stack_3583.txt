Is AWS Elastic Beanstalk traffic from load balancer to backend EC2 instances secure? AWS Elastic Beanstalk service routes traffic back to its EC2 instances through HTTP by default. I know this can be configured to achieve end to end encryption by adding SSL encryption from the load balancer back to its EC2 instance(s). I also know that by default everything created by Elastic Beanstalk is inside a VPC.Is the default configuration (ELB &lt;-- HTTP --> EC2) secure?
