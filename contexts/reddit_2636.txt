How do you shut off work-brain and turn on life-brain?
I have this bad habit of always constantly thinking about work and I don't know why. To clarify, I work in social media, digital marketing, and work with small brands and businesses. It's hard not to think about the work I do since I literally see the work I do on my phone, when using instagram or Facebook. Also, if I was working on a specific task that day, I'm always thinking about ways to improve processes or flows. For someone who's an account manager, and manages a book of business, it's not easy to just shut off that part of your brain. Social media is 24/7, and anything can happen at a minutes notice. Couple with the fact that advertising is a major field and things are always evolving, hmmm.
