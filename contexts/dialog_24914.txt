ALFREDA: You a mini-golfer?
THEO: Nope.
ALFREDA: Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
ALFREDA: Can I get you something for the road?
THEO: You have orange whips?
ALFREDA: Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
THEO: No. I'm from Akron.
WOMAN: I just hold it loosely with both hands?
MAN: That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
WOMAN: Grasp firmly. Then what?
MAN: Line up where you want it.
WOMAN: Yeah.
MAN: Now swing it out a little to the right...
WOMAN: Like this?
MAN: No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman. His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
WOMAN: Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
MAN: Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
WOMAN: Yippy!
