No one cares until you're about to kill yourself
It's funny how no one says anything until you're about to kill yourself. It doesn't matter how much you're suffering, you are a selfish bastard if you kill yourself, you should think of your friends and family and everyone who will miss you. Well, these people don't care if I'm suffering or not as long, as they don't have to notice or think about it. 

How long am I supposed to keep it all pent up inside? It's so fucking tiring.
