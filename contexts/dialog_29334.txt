WOODY: C'mon, guys! Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
REX: But what if Andy gets another dinosaur? A mean one? I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
WOODY: Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced. This is Andy we're talking about.
WOODY: It doesn't matter how much we're played with. What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us. That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
HAMM: Pardon me. I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
WOODY: Stay calm, everyone!!
