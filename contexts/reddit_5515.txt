What to do when you feel under qualified for new job?
Just got a new dream job that I’m VERY excited about. While I felt during the interviews that I had the right qualifications and experience...I’m realizing that might not totally be the case.

Was hired for a higher management technical role...and just after day 2 learning about my job, I think I might not ACTUALLY have all the technical skills I’ll need. I know I can easily learn...but now I’m worried about people thinking the same and thinking they made a mistake hiring me.

Anyone else feel that way? How do you combat it? Fake it til you make it?
