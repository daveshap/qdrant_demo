LUKE: Thank you Mrs. Franklin. Jackie? This has been very valuable for us. And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
JACKIE: It's Wednesday night. She's at my house. I'll talk to her.
LUKE: I'll call from work. We can have a conference call.
JACKIE: You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
LUKE: You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
JACKIE: I'm worried.
LUKE: Me too.
JACKIE: Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend... ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
LUKE: Fine. But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
JACKIE: Easy enough.
LUKE: Good...Well...Take care.
ANNABELLE: I didn't say that. Why would I say that?
JACKIE: Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
ANNABELLE: I don't want that to happen. Why would I want that to happen?
JACKIE: Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
ANNABELLE: Mass hysteria.
JACKIE: Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
ANNABELLE: I'm not upset. Why would I be upset?
JACKIE: Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face. You wind up looking like...
ANNABELLE: Like who?
JACKIE: Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
