Severance package help deciding between 2 options.
Hello! If this post doesnâ€™t belong here please let me know. 

I was recently laid off from a start up company. They originally offered me 4 weeks pay as a severance package, but I negotiated in some stock options. 

Now they are saying it is too expensive to add in the stock options so I can:

A) take 6 weeks pay instead of 4 weeks but not get any options 

OR 

B) get one week pay but get 2,500 shares included. So I am basically covering the legal fees it takes to write a new contract. 

This was my first job and I was there for a year and 4 months. I am just wondering if anyone else has experience with this or if anyone has a creative argument/knowledge to get both 4 weeks pay and the stock options. Thank you!
