LONGSHANKS: My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
PRINCESS: No. He did not.
LONGSHANKS: Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
PRINCESS: He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
LONGSHANKS: You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
PRINCESS: ...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
LONGSHANKS: The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
PRINCESS: Humbly, M'lord.
