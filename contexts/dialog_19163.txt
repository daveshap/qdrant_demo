WAYNE: Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
MCCLUSKY: The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
WAYNE: Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
MCCLUSKY: Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
WAYNE: When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
MCCLUSKY: What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
WAYNE: Who is we?
MCCLUSKY: The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
WAYNE: Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
MCCLUSKY: Using the same doctors is not common practice.
WAYNE: I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
MCCLUSKY: Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
