LEVENE: Why?
WILLIAMSON: The leads are assigned randomly...
LEVENE: Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
WILLIAMSON: ...apart from the top men on the contest board.
LEVENE: Then put me on the board.
WILLIAMSON: You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
LEVENE: I can't close these leads, John. No one can. It's a joke. John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads. As a test
WILLIAMSON: I can't do it, Shel.
