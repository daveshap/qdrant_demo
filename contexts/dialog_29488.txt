RENTON: This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
BEGBIE: Did you bring the cards?
SICK BOY: What?
BEGBIE: The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
SICK BOY: Well, I've not brought them.
BEGBIE: It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
SICK BOY: Well, I've not brought them.
BEGBIE: It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
SICK BOY: I'm sorry.
BEGBIE: Bit fucking late, like.
SICK BOY: Well, why didn't you bring them?
BEGBIE: Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
SICK BOY: Christ.
