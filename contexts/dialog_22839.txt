BO: What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
DANNY/TOM: That's it?
BO: Are you Australian?
DANNY/TOM: No.
BO: Good. I fucking hate Australians.
DANNY/TOM: You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
BO: Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty. Just kinda' filthy is all.
DANNY/TOM: You mind?
BO: No, I don't mind. That's how come I told you about it.
DANNY/TOM: I was talking to my wife.
