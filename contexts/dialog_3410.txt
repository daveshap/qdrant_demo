LOTTE: Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
MAXINE: Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
LOTTE: But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
MAXINE: I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
