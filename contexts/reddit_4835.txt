Finally spoke to my parents about my depression. Their reaction wasn't quite what I had thought.
I (20M) have been living with depression for the better part of a year now. I was always afraid to tell my parents because they worry too much, and I didn't want them neglecting their own health over mine.

However, the circumstances over the past few days, added with the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent quarantine has broken me like no other, and I finally opened up to my parents about my feelings.

They told me to "stop being a baby" and to just "snap out of it".

What do I do now? I have never felt so lost in my life. And this is coming from a person who hasn't had a proper social interaction in more than a year. 

Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.
