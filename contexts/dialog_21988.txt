KITTLE: Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
D.A. RAVICH: You're about an inch away from insubordination!
KITTLE: Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
D.A. RAVICH: Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
KITTLE: I say, fuck 'em. Let's go.
BILLY-BOY: Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right? Let's talk about it.
KITTLE: What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
BILLY-BOY: I'm just saying...
KITTLE: You're just saying nothing! Tonight is the night.
BILLY-BOY: Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
KITTLE: What of it? Haven't we waited forever... ? Haven't we, honey? Haven't we waited long enough to get this scumbag?
KITTLE: What... ? Not you too?
NENA: He's right. We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
KITTLE: I can't believe I'm hearing this,
NENA: I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle, It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
KITTLE: That's not true.
NENA: I know it is, even if you don't.
BILLY-BOY: All I got is being a cop. What do I do if I'm not that?
KITTLE: You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you. And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of. You of all people...
NENA: Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
KITTLE: Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
