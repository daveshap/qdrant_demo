AUSTIN: When do I begin?
BASIL EXPOSITION: Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
AUSTIN: You mean Mrs. Kensington?
BASIL EXPOSITION: No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms. Kensington is her daughter.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Vanessa's one of our top agents.
AUSTIN: My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue? I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
VANESSA: Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
AUSTIN: Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
VANESSA: My mother's told me all about you.
AUSTIN: If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me. God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
VANESSA: My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated. She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
AUSTIN: Thank you, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN: Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION: Be careful.
AUSTIN: Thanks.
