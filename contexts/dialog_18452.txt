HALLOR: I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
LONGFELLOW: What kind of wife did you say she was?
HALLOR: Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
LONGFELLOW: A child? My uncle's?
HALLOR: Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW: That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
HALLOR: I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
LONGFELLOW: If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
