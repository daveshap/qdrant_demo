Anyone else have to basically be dead to call off of work and not feel guilty?
My stomach is an absolute mess, i can barely move without running to the toilet. But telling my boss I can't come in makes me crazy anxious, worrying they'll think I'm slacking or something. So then I put it off until I have to leave and just end up showing up and being miserable and unproductive all day. Anyone have issues calling off?
