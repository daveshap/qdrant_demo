TIDWELL: No, Roy. I'm not gonna cry.
FIRESTONE: -- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars. Playing in the state where you grew up.
TIDWELL: I... I love everybody, man. I love my wife. My kids. Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee. My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
FIRESTONE: It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
