Parents offered to pay for MA
I'll be starting an MA this fall, and will be going to a PhD after that. My parents have offered to pay for my entire MA + living expenses. I've accepted their offer, but I feel weird about it. They're not the type that would hold this over me in the future. They wholeheartedly want to me pursue my academic dreams. Is it wrong to feel this way? I feel kind of immature, as if my MA is like my undergraduate, which my parents also paid for. I'd appreciate any thoughts. Thanks
