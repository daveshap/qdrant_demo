What is the name of the book where there are mages who use talismans (?) to battle other mages? I have been looking for a book for decades. I only remember some things because I read it when I was quite young.It was the story of this mage who came back to his hometown where four mage families/houses ruled. There was a 5th family that was destroyed and this mage belonged to that family, he was its last member and he returned to avenge his house/family. The mages used some sort of talismans(?) to battle other mages and if they won the battle they could take one of the oponents talismans. Each talisman had its own purpose and would work or not against other talismans.There was also in the story an arena were the mages battled.Does anyone know of a story like this?
