AMANDA: We should try fishing again.
PAUL: You mean it?
AMANDA: I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
ERIC: The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
GRANT: She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
GRANT: It's strikes me now I never told her that.
ERIC: You should.
GRANT: You're right.
GRANT: Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
ERIC: No. I couldn't see.
GRANT: Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you? They look worried.
