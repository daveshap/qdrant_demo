EMPEROR: A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
REVEREND MOTHER: We felt his presence.
EMPEROR: I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
REVEREND MOTHER: Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
EMPEROR: Yes?
REVEREND MOTHER: Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
EMPEROR: He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
REVEREND MOTHER: I am your Truthsayer, my lord... He is here, my lord.
