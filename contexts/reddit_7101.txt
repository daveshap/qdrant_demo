I start my first job on the 16th, and truthfully, I'm scared as all hell.
This is going to be my first ever 9-5 (I did under the table work with my dad and also my grandpa, but neither job included working with food and very many people) and while I'm ready for it, just everything in me right now is freaking the hell out. My first day is training on the back line (I'll be working at a Arby's) so I'll be learning how to make the food and such for the first week or two before I move to night shift as a cashier. What are some general do's and don'ts and I need some good advice from those that have worked in the fast food industry. Anything to just try and calm myself down a bit.
