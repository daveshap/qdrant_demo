LLOYD: After work?
DIANE: I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
LLOYD: Won't you see me later?
DIANE: I know you think my job is strange. You don't like old people, do you?
LLOYD: Me? Sure I do.
DIANE: Come on.
LLOYD: Well, except for one thing. I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat. And they just jammed their mouths, you know? The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me. You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
DIANE: I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old. Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
LLOYD: Really? Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
DIANE: Stop by later.
LLOYD: Okay, bye, I will.
DIANE: Okay, bye.
LLOYD: I'll see you there. Bye.
DIANE: You have to meet Bess.
LLOYD: Okay.
DIANE: She's amazing. She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
LLOYD: Wait, wait. You told her about me?
DIANE: Yes.
LLOYD: What did you say?
DIANE: Well... just meet her.
