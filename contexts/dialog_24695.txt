KAT: You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don’t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It’s your job. It’s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
NICK: You’re judging me?! Oh, that’s a good one. You’re lying to me, you’re lying to your family, and you’re lying to yourself. But you’re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
KAT: You’re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
NICK: Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you’ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
NICK: I’ll just check into a hotel.
ED: Don’t be ridiculous. It’s late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
