Are Indeed assessments actually worth anything?
I have taken a TON of assessments on Indeed, and have scored really well on many of them. To me, they seem like valuable workplace skills, but I'm not sure if employers are actually taking these into account, or even care at all.

Do recruiters or hiring employers actually take these assessments into account when looking at Indeed resumes?

Edit: To add a little more detail, I have taken assessments both as part of job applications, as well as many assessments that I took initiative and completed on my own. I work in industrial electronics/automation/electrical/etc., and proficiency exams are common because technicians need to objectively prove they can do the job. But aside from exams relevant to my craft, I've gone out and taken exams for other industries. For example, I took the "Marketing" exam and scored "Expert," so that gets me excited in thinking about how I can leverage that for a career shift/improvement.
