If you had $440 a month leftover (rent/phone/food etc 'mandatory expenses' all paid off) and only that much, what would you do with it?
edit: should have been more clear, there will probably be people going like 'id buy a bunch of drugs' lol. i mean if you want to be wise about it and make the most of what little you have, and not "waste" any.

I've minimized my expenses as much as I can handle, pretty much got it down to bills, phone, ymca, and amazon. i quit smoking, drinking, video games, all i do now is go to the ymca and watch youtube. Just saving money won't cut it forever, i am only allowed to have a total of $2000 to my name  (ssi, which is why the $440 is fixed) so unless i withdraw some and buy some Gold to bury every month to keep it from tipping over the limit, there's an expiration date. so I'm curious for people with more knowledge and experience, if you knew what you know but you were suddenly in my position with a fixed income, what would you do to be smart with the $440? investment? going to lots of garage sales and trying to flip? etc
