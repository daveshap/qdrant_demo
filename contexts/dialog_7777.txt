HARRY: HARRY.
LLOYD: You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
HARRY: No.
LLOYD: Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
HARRY: What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
LLOYD: Don't look directly at him.
RAY: LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
LLOYD: Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
