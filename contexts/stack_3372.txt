Harry Potter \"Sirius' daughter\" fanfiction where her mother is incapacitated in St. Mungo's I'm looking for a Harry Potter \"Sirius has a daughter\" fanfiction that I read a few years ago on Quotev. It was about a Sirius' daughter, and she was dating one of the Weasley twins. I cannot remember if she was sorted into Ravenclaw or Slytherin. Her mother, whilst still alive, is incapacitated in St. Mungo's (I think she might be crazy, or something similar.) However, she somehow gets out/escapes from St. Mungo's in the daughter's book.There had also been another story linked to that one. It was about the girl's mother when she was at Hogwarts. If it helps, I can vaguely remember the cover to the Marauders Era fic, and I can recall the face-claim of Sirius' daughter. Marauders Era: I'm pretty sure the background was Slytherin green. It might've had an image of Hogwarts behind the figure of Phoebe Tonkin, who is in robes. Phoebe plays the mother when she's younger. The face-claim of Sirius' daughter is Danielle Campbell.
