JACK: Got a job first thing in the morning, first day of season. Saturday I'll hunt for myself. Twombley something. - Er --
WADE: Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official from Massachusetts. You're lucky.
JACK: Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
WADE: How'd you get the job?
JACK: Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
