Is there a time limit before one HAS to take on a leadership position in order to stay relevant and hireable?
I keep getting this advice from everyone and its getting kind of annoying. 

Im sure there are definitely cases where this was the case but isnt real life more nuanced than that? 

The arbitrary period is 3 to 4 years from what im hearing before you must transition to leadership.

What about specialization? 

Who in the world can be an expert in ANY field in 3 to 5 years?? 
Isnt base line competency and knowledge a prerequisite to leading well?

Like really now. 

Please share with me your thoughts
