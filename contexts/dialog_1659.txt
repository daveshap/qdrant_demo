SALLY: Why didn't you bring him?
CLAIR: What?
SALLY: Why didn't you bring him?
CLAIR: He's allergic.
SALLY: Oh.
CLAIR: To dander. Otis.
SALLY: Oh.
CLAIR: Didn't I say?
SALLY: Well, probably.

SALLY: Oh.
CLAIR: So they tell me. Not soon enough, of course. How are you, Sal? You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know. A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it. Doesn't it, Mac? You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
MAC: It's an object lesson in grace. Wow! Look who's here before me! My leading man is on time for once.
