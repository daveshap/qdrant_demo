JABEZ: Are they all as -- small -- as that?
SCRATCH: Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary. Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing. In your case --
JABEZ: My time isn't up yet.
SCRATCH: Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
JABEZ: I'm through with you.
SCRATCH: What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
JABEZ: I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
SCRATCH: Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
JABEZ: Not now! Not now! -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
SCRATCH: Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone -- -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
JABEZ: Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
SCRATCH: I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of -- You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
JABEZ: No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
SCRATCH: Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.
