Would it be possible to invert a tokamak to make a solar probe? I was just browsing random stuff on the internet, and I came across this article about the parker solar probe. The rhetoric was like \"oh my, the sun is so hot but the probe won't melt.. etc. etc.\and I had a flash back to someone lecturing about tokamak fusion, so I thought the article was going to say something about magnetic fields, but it didn't. And as I was thinking about it I remembered the earths magnetic field, but that just channels the suns plasma to the poles? For a solar probe you'd need to channel the plasma from coming directly towards the object to going any other direction... it's like the opposite of confinement need for fusion, but I'm not smart enough to think about it that abstractly and say it's possible...
