Possibly toxic work environment?
I just started a new job and it’s my third day. My boss has exhibited some irrational and unexpected behavior already and I’m wondering if I should call it quits and get back on the job search or stick it out and try to make it work, especially since we’re in a pandemic. He’s been criticizing me for not being what he expected and says that I should be grateful to him for hiring me during a pandemic and that my field is maybe not right for me. I feel like this is irrational because it’s only my third day. He said in thirty days he’ll decide to keep me on or to let me go. Should I try to shape up or is this a big enough red flag to just jump ship? This is only my first job out of college and so I’m uncertain about next steps.
