Anyone else lost the energy to deal with people, like ANY people, even friends?
My anxiety takes so much energy from me, I avoid people as much as I can, even my friends, even family. The moment they start talking it feels like sensory overload immediatly. I have to force myself out of the house so much. I am working from home, which makes it even worse. I DO feel lonely sometimes but then imaging someone being around is such an unbearable thought. 
It is NOT social anxiety, I am not scared of people or what they think of me, I just think they're unbearable and I lack the energy to deal with their bullshit. I used to be super extrovert some years ago, it all changed when I developed anxiety. 
I'm in therapy already, but it doesn't help, like at all. I don't wanna live and die like a hermit, but I don't know how to help it.
