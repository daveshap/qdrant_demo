Can I remap mouse keys for games running using wine? I want to play idle-action games (like Witcher I or FTL) with a single hand. These games are both action and idle because you can press spacebar to stop action and think about strategy and what to do next. This pause cannot be remapped to mouse in-game and that is why I asking here. In Ubuntu, is there any possible way how to fake spacebar input every time I press 4th mouse button?Note: I'm running these games using wine
