DICKSON: I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
CLARK: Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
DICKSON: Yes! You said it, Clark. That's the only thing that means anything to me.
