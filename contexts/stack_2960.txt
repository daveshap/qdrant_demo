Is there any threat to the results of our effective field theories from unknown higher energy theories? We use renormalization arguments (and experiments) to change the couplings of a theory and suppress the higher energy physics (saying things like \u201cwhatever the fundamental theory, this will be true of the low energy theory.\u201d). And we then get some set of fields, correlation functions, etc. My question is just about the possibility of, say, a theory of quantum gravity that compromises the renormalization arguments we\u2019d been using to determine the sensitivity of EFTs to the space of possible high energy theories. So, perhaps the actual theory wasn\u2019t included in the high energy theory space?
