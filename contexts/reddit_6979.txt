Given a Performance Improvement Plan
So today I was given the dreaded PIP.

My boss sat me down, and said that our company has been having a rough quarter, and we have had quite a few meetings about reducing overhead. Unfortunately for me, My job is almost all overhead. When I was given the PIP, part of the improvement was bringing my billable hours up, but it's entirely dependent on other people giving me work (Work they themselves probably need right now!).  I have basically been able to maintain a 5% billable ratio, just with small assignments i'm given on top of my regular overhead tasks.  The plan is asking for a 55% billable rate by next month.

I'm not sure if it's an impossible task and they're pushing me out, or if i'm just being short sighted. I have made a few other mistakes, and due to my lack of attention to detail it probably made me a prime candidate for someone to get rid of.   My boss is usually extremely fair, and she has gone above and beyond to be a good person in the past.  I just think it's an impossible task, because I have BEEN trying to become more utilized.  Our group is notorious for keeping all the work to themselves, and since we have small projects it has worked until now.

When she gave me the PIP, she gave me a timeline of 3 weeks.  There were a few other requests, but the mountain to climb is becoming more billable.  She said at 1.5 weeks if things are not looking good, I can call it quits and still get paid for the remaining 1.5.  I am wondering if this seems like the situation where even if i pull off the impossible, I will still be fired.  I never want to be lazy, but if things are futile I think my efforts can be spent somewhere else.

I am almost finished with college, I have about 4 classes this semester, and then 3 classes I was going to take online over the summer.  I have already started updating my resume, and this afternoon i'll start applying for jobs.    Any advice will be much appreciated.  I am overwhelmed and surprised by this.   I just had a performance review that went somewhat positive( I basically got the equivalent of a C at school), and not 2 weeks later I was given the PIP.

TLDR:   Got a PIP, wondering  Is it hopeless?  Should I spent my 1.5 weeks looking for a job, and then the rest of the 1.5 weeks going to interviews?  Or should I just try my best?
