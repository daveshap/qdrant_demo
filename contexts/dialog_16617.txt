MAYA: So...what did you think of the tape.
PETER: I think you gave me the wrong one.
MAYA: What do you mean?
PETER: It was blank. Nothing on it. You gave me the wrong one.
MAYA: You're sure? There was nothing?
PETER: I cranked it all the way up. Nothing but hum.
PETER: So what'd I miss?
MAYA: You're right. I must've made a mistake.
