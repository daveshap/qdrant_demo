DOC: You can't trust anything these days.
CAROL: I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
DOC: I trust... Want to see what I trust... In God we trust... The word's on every bill!!!
CAROL: You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
