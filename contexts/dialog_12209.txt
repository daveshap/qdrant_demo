MAST: What happened, pilgrim?
JAKE: Just leave me alone.
MAST: But I'm here to help you...
NIKI: Did you find out where she was?
JAKE: Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
NIKI: What happened?
JAKE: Where is he?
NIKI: I can't tell you that.
JAKE: Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
NIKI: But then you'll forget about me.
JAKE: Where is he, Niki?
