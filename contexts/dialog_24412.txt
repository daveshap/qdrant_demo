MESSNER: He's giving them up?
CARRUTHERS: All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
MESSNER: Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
CARRUTHERS: That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
MESSNER: What about the sheriff's task force?
CARRUTHERS: Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
