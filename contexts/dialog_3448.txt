EDWARD: You -- -- are in for a surprise.
WILL: Am I?
EDWARD: Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
WILL: Did you do any of that?
EDWARD: No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
WILL: You think I'm up for it?
EDWARD: You learned from the best.
