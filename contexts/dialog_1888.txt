WILLARD: Our Recon flight ?
CIVILIAN: Ours.
WILLARD: Touchy.
CIVILIAN: You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
WILLARD: You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
CIVILIAN: Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
WILLARD: Terminate ?
CIVILIAN: Terminate with extreme prejudice.
WILLARD: I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
WILLARD: Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
CHIEF: All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
WILLARD: Let's go.
CHIEF: The Delta closes off to us about ten miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
WILLARD: We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
CHIEF: 'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
WILLARD: Shot himself. What for ?
CHIEF: Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
WILLARD: Arch light.
CHEF: I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
CHIEF: Anybody see some smoke ?
CLEAN: Too far inland.
