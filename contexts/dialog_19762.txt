EHRLICHMAN: He's begging for a meeting, chief. He wants to go overseas for awhile.
NIXON: Well, no place where they speak English. That way he can always say he was misquoted.
CUSHMAN: Mr. President, I don't know what to say. As soon as we learned from the Secret Service you were en route, the Director was notified. He should be here any minute.
NIXON: Where the hell is he?
CUSHMAN: Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
NIXON: So ... let's go ...
CUSHMAN: He told me to take you to his conference room.
NIXON: No. His office. I want a very private conversation. I don't want to be bugged.
CUSHMAN: Then his office will be fine.
NIXON: How's the job coming, Bob?
CUSHMAN: Frankly, sir, it stinks. I have no access. I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
NIXON: We'll see about that ...
CUSHMAN: He's nervous, sir. He's heard you're looking for a new director.
NIXON: Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
CUSHMAN: That's Helms. He's sang froid
NIXON: Yeah? Well, I own the fucking casino.
HELMS: I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
NIXON: My friends call me Mister President.""
HELMS: And so shall I. Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
NIXON: Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
HELMS: I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President. You did.
