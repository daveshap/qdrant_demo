Got Let Go Today- FL, USA
After two weeks, I've been let go from my job. Specifically cited in my boss's speech was the panic attack I had yesterday. I had already previously disclosed my panic disorder. I had to clock out and calm down and was told to leave and take it easy, I thought everything was fine. Until today, my boss hands me my paycheck and fires me. She says business is slow and I'm not capable of handling the job. She said she'd give me a letter of recommendation if I needed one. And that was it. 

I'm so lost on what to do next... It took me a month to find this job, and now I have to start the job hunt all over again. Any advice? Or anyone want to commiserate?
