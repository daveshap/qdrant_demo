My employer has stopped paying me due to lack of funds, but they say I am not laid off. What’s the best way to handle this situation?
I’ve worked for my employer, a startup, since the end of May. There’s been 2 other times before when they were a day or two late with payroll. 

Monday was payday. I asked for my check and was told by the CEO and CFO that they have no money to pay payroll. They also informed me that other members of staff have taken extra stock options in lieu of pay, or are taking a “voluntary hiatus.”

I don’t know what to do. I know I can’t work for free. I would prefer not to go back to work until I get pay for my last pay period, but I don’t want it to be considered job abandonment and keep me from getting unemployment. 

What should I do in this situation?
