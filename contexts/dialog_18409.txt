SAUNDERS: Why do I always laugh at that?
DIZ: There's more light here
SAUNDERS: Drunks are funny--
DIZ: Yeah. Funny--
SAUNDERS: Yeah.
DIZ: Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
SAUNDERS: Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
DIZ: My friends?
SAUNDERS: Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
DIZ: Waiter!
SAUNDERS: --followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
DIZ: Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
SAUNDERS: Shut up, Diz.
DIZ: Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!
SAUNDERS: And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
DIZ: Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
SAUNDERS: Do you know how I felt, Diz?
DIZ: No. How'd you feel? Quick.
SAUNDERS: Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take-- Say--who started this?
DIZ: *I'm* just waiting for a street car--
SAUNDERS: Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
DIZ: I apologize.
SAUNDERS: *All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
DIZ: Again? Good idea.
SAUNDERS: Diz--
DIZ: Yeah.
SAUNDERS: How about getting married?
DIZ: Good idea. When?
SAUNDERS: Any time.
DIZ: Tonight?
SAUNDERS: Okay. You don't mind?
DIZ: I'll cherish ya.
SAUNDERS: You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like *people*--get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
DIZ: Tunnel?
SAUNDERS: You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
DIZ: Is the wind tired out there?
SAUNDERS: Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
DIZ: Have *you*?
SAUNDERS: No.
DIZ: Do we *have* to?
SAUNDERS: No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
DIZ: Well, let's get going.
SAUNDERS: Where?
DIZ: We're gonna get married.
SAUNDERS: Yeah--that's right. Diz--
DIZ: What?
SAUNDERS: I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
DIZ: What?
SAUNDERS: My first name's--Clarissa.
DIZ: Yeah, I know. That's okay.
SAUNDERS: Don't say okay
DIZ: Okay--I mean--
SAUNDERS: You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
DIZ: No--not offhand--
SAUNDERS: Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
DIZ: Susan? Nah!
SAUNDERS: I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
DIZ: You said it!
SAUNDERS: I'm getting out of there. Right now, Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--
DIZ: Hey! We're gettin' married--!
SAUNDERS: Right now--everything I own--!
