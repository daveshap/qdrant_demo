You ever just leave an awkward conversation and think “Wow. I should really just kill myself.”?
That’s how all my relationships go. It’s no wonder nobody wants to be around me voluntarily. Sure, I can make people laugh but that’s where my conversational ability ends. I don’t leave conversations feeling like I made a new friend or that I matter to people.
