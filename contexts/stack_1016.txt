Network activity for decision to suspend/hibernate i have a small server (ubuntu server) which i am using on demand. Meaning it switches on from suspend on request. I was trying to find a way, using cron to put the server to sleep after 90 min of network inactivity.Until now I found only ways to detect the ssh activity, which i would include too.Can you point me into the right direction? After searching and playing with tools for a day, i am lost on this one.I didn't find a adequate program nor a possible solution for usage in cron.
