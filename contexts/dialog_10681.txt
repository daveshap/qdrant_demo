EPPS: Hey.
MURPHY: Hey.
EPPS: Couldn't sleep.
MURPHY: Wish I could say the same.
EPPS: What do you think happened on this boat?
MURPHY: I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
EPPS: The what?
MURPHY: Never mind. Before your time. I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
EPPS: Are we smart enough to avoid that?
MURPHY: I don't know, are we?
EPPS: When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something. Someone.
MURPHY: Not our mystery guest again.
EPPS: No. Someone else. A girl. I'm not sure she was... real.
