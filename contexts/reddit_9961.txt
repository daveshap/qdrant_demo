How do I get more experience? [Location Bound]
Hi Everyone! 

I have been having issues getting a position in my area (location, not functional). I am open to anything, except live on, because of my family life situation. But almost every position I apply to at these 2 different institutions automatically come back with this:

"The University was most fortunate to receive many qualified applications.  After an extensive review of the applications, the committee has narrowed the pool of candidates to those whose qualifications are most closely aligned with the job requirements.  Although your application is no longer being considered, we appreciate your interest in a career at \[INSTITUTION NAME\]" 

&#x200B;

And yes, I am applying to other institutions. There are only 3 in my area that post positions regularly.. so basically I'm only getting interviews from 1. Some of the jobs I have applied to required associates degrees and no experience, yet my masters degree and 2 years GA are having zero effect? Am I fudging the application somehow? If not, What do I do to get more relevant experience, because it seems like I am going to be waiting until the next hiring cycle to get my first position.

Note: I posted last month about a job interview I was preparing for ([https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/cvq1j5/preparing\_for\_academic\_advising\_interview\_seeking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/cvq1j5/preparing_for_academic_advising_interview_seeking/)) , and I'm still waiting to hear back. So, No update yet.
