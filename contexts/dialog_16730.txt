BOBBY: So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
JIMMY: Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
BOBBY: Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
JIMMY: You don't know where you're going?
BOBBY: No. Just the cross streets.
JIMMY: Well, this is the corner.
JIMMY: I can wait around if you want.
BOBBY: No. That's cool, man.
RICKY: What exactly did they say?
BOBBY: They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
RICKY: They didn't say an address?
BOBBY: I told you what they said.
RICKY: Nothing else.
BOBBY: Nothing.
RICKY: How'd they know who you were?
BOBBY: They asked who it was.
RICKY: So they said more than the address.
BOBBY: No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
RICKY: This is bullshit, man.
BOBBY: What the fuck do you...
BOBBY: What the fuck do you have to complain about?
RICKY: Don't even start.
BOBBY: No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
RICKY: Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
BOBBY: You sold it? I thought they stole it.
RICKY: Sold it, stole it, whatever...
BOBBY: Motherfucker...
RICKY: Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
BOBBY: You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
RICKY: Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
BOBBY: You just don't fucking get it, do you?
RICKY: You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
BOBBY: What the fuck is that supposed --
RICKY: I mean, that's what I heard --
BOBBY: You got something to say --
