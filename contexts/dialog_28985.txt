SHORTIE: Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
BRETT: What is it?
SHORTIE: Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
BRETT: Oh, is she? What a shame! You'll pardon me?
LOTHER: You're coming back--
BRETT: That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
LOTHER: How much did you lose?
SUMMERS: About twelve hundred.
LOTHER: I went for four.
SUMMERS: It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
