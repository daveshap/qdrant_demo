I was rejected from Harvard- Ethan Kim
Hey guys, my name is Ethan Kim. I was rejected from Harvard but it’s all good. College doesn’t define who you are as an individual. And while the rejection stung initially, I know that I’m not meant to be in Cambridge and this is ultimately for the best. 

About 2 months ago I put out a rap video and while I knew it was a big risk, I knew it was the most authentic version of myself. 

Today I was rejected but I’m still keeping that same energy. No college can define who I am and I will continue to be myself.

I’ll be uploading a video soon to the same channel that the rap video was posted. 

Thank you to everyone for your support and congrats to those who were accepted!!!

Edit: The video is out
