SHERIFF COBB: I see you're prospering without me.
PADEN: It's been a while.
SHERIFF COBB: Where's the dog?
PADEN: Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
SHERIFF COBB: Let's talk about that. I'm looking for some men.
PADEN: I've given that up.
SHERIFF COBB: So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
PADEN: You've got a legitimate job.
SHERIFF COBB: Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
PADEN: You're right.
SHERIFF COBB: This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
PADEN: Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
