Does it matter which college I go to?
Currently I am deciding between 2 colleges in which to go for a computer science degree. I live in Ohio and I'm deciding between a local liberal arts school and a popular school called The University of Akron. I'm wondering if I should go with the Uakron as it is popularly known as an engineering school. Thus it might get me a better job somewhere. Thanks for your time!
