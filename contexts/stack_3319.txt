Anime series about a pair of twins and a doctor I remember watching an anime series in the 2000s, that had as main protagonist a male doctor, that in the past rescued the life of a pair of twins, one of them male, the other female.As they grew up, the brother became very evil. At some point when the kids were in their early twenties, the whole actual plot came into motion, with both the doctor and the sister setting out on a journey to kill the evil brother, often separated. The hunt did at least for some time go through Germany, the people depicted with huge noses often. The whole storytelling was also working heavily with views into the past as the protagonists hunted the elusive evil brother, showcasing what the evil brother had experienced in the past.I remember the thing having about... 74 or something episodes, and it was very likely a manga adaption.
