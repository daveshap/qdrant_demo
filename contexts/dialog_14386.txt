JACOB: They stole it.
RESIDENT: Who did?
JACOB: I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
RESIDENT: We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
NURSE: I'll page him.
JACOB: Call my chiropractor.
NURSE: We're doing everything we can.
JACOB: Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
RESIDENT: I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
JACOB: No. Don't move me.
RESIDENT: I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
JACOB: Goddamn it. I want Louis.
