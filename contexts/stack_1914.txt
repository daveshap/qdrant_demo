What is the difference between saying a person is genuine, and saying a person is authentic? I understand that the words genuine and authentic differ in some scenarios. For example, if we say that a designer bag is genuine then it is not a replica; and if we say that an Italian restaurant is authentic, then the food is made the Italian way. But in English, we do not say that a designer bag is authentic and an Italian restaurant is genuine. We say that a cold caller is genuine if he's not scamming, and that a radio advert is authentic if the statements it makes are true. But we do not say a cold caller is authentic and a radio advert is genuine.So when using an adjective to describe a person, not a specific behaviour they exhibit, but a person, what is the difference in calling a person authentic, and calling them genuine?Example<blockquote>  \"You're such a genuine person Molly!\" Meena told her    \"You're such an authentic person Molly!\" Meena told her</blockquote>What difference in meaning is conveyed by the two sentences?
