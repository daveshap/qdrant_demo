Is it reasonable for a company to force you to find a replacement for you when you use PTO?
I work as front desk for an apartment place, and work Wed-Sunday, 3-12, so finding people to work those shifts on the weekend can be difficult, and feel my boss should not make me have to find someone to cover my own PTO.
