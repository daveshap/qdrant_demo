If we know the distance of a distant light emitting object, how could we know the age without knowing how long the light has been here? I have been contemplating the age of our observable universe and I was unsure as to how we could tell the age by only divdeing the distance by the constent with out knowing how long the light has been here. Wouldn't that only tell us the minimum of elapsed time.
