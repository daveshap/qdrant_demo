DR. CHILTON: Come in.
GUARD: Dr. Chilton.
DR. CHILTON: Yes?
GUARD: When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
DR. CHILTON: Do you have it?
GUARD: Yeah. It's right here.
DR. CHILTON: Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
GUARD: No.
