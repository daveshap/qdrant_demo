JAEGER: Yeah, you're funny.
WES: It's a puzzle box. If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
JAEGER: For real? A treasure?
EPPS: Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
JAEGER: There might be something in there.
EPPS: Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
JAEGER: There might be.
WES: And you're the guy who's going to open it.
JAEGER: I could.
