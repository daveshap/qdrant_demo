OLIVER: What do you want. Amy?
AMY: I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to tell you about the other children.
OLIVER: Can't you tell me later?
AMY: But I didn't play with them, Daddy. They wouldn't play with me.
OLIVER: What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
AMY: It was on account of the birthday party.
OLIVER: Because you didn't ask them? I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
AMY: They ran away.
OLIVER: Why didn't you run after them?
AMY: I did. I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
OLIVER: Now Amy
AMY: It's true.
OLIVER: And who did the voice belong to?
AMY: It was just a voice.
OLIVER: Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories â€” I'm sick of this sort of thing.
AMY: Daddy, it's true.
OLIVER: Let me be the judge of that.
ALICE: My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
OLIVER: Amy's been lying again.
AMY: No, I didn't.
OLIVER: Voices from an old dark house!
ALICE: Did you hear the child out?
OLIVER: Well, it seemed to me --
ALICE: You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
OLIVER: I'm never unfair.
ALICE: You're shouting at me.
OLIVER: I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
OLIVER: I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
AMY: You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
