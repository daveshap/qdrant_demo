ANNIE: It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?-- --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place. Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
PAUL: I'm glad you like it.
ANNIE: Paul, this will be our legacy.
PAUL: It will.
ANNIE: Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
PAUL: You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
ANNIE: What things?
PAUL: You don't know?
ANNIE: I was fooling, silly. You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne. Dome Pear-igg-non.
PAUL: Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
