DUKE: What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
GONZO: Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
DA: Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
GONZO: You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
DA: What do you mean by that?
GONZO: You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
DUKE: Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
DA: WHAT?
GONZO: Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
DUKE: We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
DA: Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
DUKE: Dobermans don't talk.
DA: What?
GONZO: Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
DUKE: They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
