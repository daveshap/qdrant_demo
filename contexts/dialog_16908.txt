SAMUEL: Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
CREASY: I drink.
SAMUEL: How does it affect you?
CREASY: My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
SAMUEL: And what if amateurs try it?
CREASY: I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
SAMUEL: No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
LISA: The world of our children. How dare they?
CREASY: It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
LISA: You're American.
CREASY: So are you.
SAMUEL: My wife, Mr. Creasy.
LISA: Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
