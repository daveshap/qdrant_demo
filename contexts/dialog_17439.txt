DREW: Hello, Beautiful.
SUSAN: Hi.
PARRISH: Good morning, Drew. Thanks for coming out.
DREW: Well, it's a big day. Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts? Last minute refine- ments or variations?
PARRISH: 'Thoughts'? Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
DREW: A voice?
PARRISH: In my sleep.
DREW: What'd it say?
PARRISH: 'Yes'.
DREW: 'Yes' to the deal?
PARRISH: Maybe, who knows? You know how voices are. Let's go.
QUINCE: Hi, Bill --
PARRISH: Good morning, Quince.
QUINCE: How're you doing--?
PARRISH: I'm doing great. You ready?
QUINCE: I am, this is it. B Day.
PARRISH: How's that, Quince?
QUINCE: Bontecou Day. Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
ALLISON: Honey, please.
QUINCE: Okay. All aboard - New York, New York!
ALLISON: Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's. You too, Drew. We've still got some loose ends --
PARRISH: Not my birthday again?
SUSAN: You're only six-five once.
PARRISH: Thank God. Now could we go? Let's get this day started.
SUSAN: I thought you were in a meeting--?
PARRISH: I am. With you.
SUSAN: ...There's a start for a meeting.
PARRISH: I know it's none of my business --
