ANNIE: Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
ALVY: Well, who's Sadie?
ANNIE: Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie... Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
ALVY: Uh, narcolepsy.
ANNIE: Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so... George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was... shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War. Anyway, so, so... George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so... so, he's dead ... he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
ALVY: Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
ANNIE: Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
ALVY: ...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
ANNIE: Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
ALVY: No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
ANNIE: Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
ALVY: Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
ANNIE: Why not?
ALVY: 'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
ANNIE: Oh, I see, I see.
ALVY: You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
ANNIE: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
ALVY: 'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
ANNIE: Fifteen years, huh?
ALVY: Fifteen years, yeah.
ANNIE: Yeah. Oh, God bless!
ALVY: God bless.
ANNIE: Well, uh... You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
ALVY: Oh, thank you.
ANNIE: Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.

ANNIE: Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
