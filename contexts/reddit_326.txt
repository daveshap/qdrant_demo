I’m so ashamed
hey guys, I really need some help.
I’ve been dating this guy for about 2 months now and I already met his parents and been to his house numerous times but has never met my mom or been to my house. 
He keeps telling me he wants to meet my mom and see where I live but I’m too ashamed. 
My mom is really controlling and weird (that’s another story though) and us two live in a one bedroom apartment (I have the bedroom, my mom sleeps on the couch) it’s been like that since forever and I don’t want to seem ungrateful but I can’t help it. My boyfriends family has a lot of money and they have a beautiful house and I just keep feeling disgustingly poor. 
I know it’s really dumb to be ashamed of something like that...
I would appreciate any advice just please don’t be mean
Love, Olivia x
