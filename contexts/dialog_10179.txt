EVA: What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
WAYNE: The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
EVA: Jason...Voorhees?
EVA: Have you seen Tamara?
WAYNE: No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
EVA: But she might be in trouble...
WAYNE: So what else is new? Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
EVA: I don't care about being hip anymore.
