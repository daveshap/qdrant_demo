Automator workflow to close programme when laptop is closed / goes to sleep I've got a programme that I use regularly that has a really bad memory leak problem. It seems to be triggered when closing my laptop / putting it to sleep and then waking the laptop up again. I wondered if it's possible to create an Automator workflow to say \"when laptop is closed / when laptop goes to sleep close programme\"?
