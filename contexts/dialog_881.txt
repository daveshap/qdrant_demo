MAFFET: You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
SYKES: What is it?
MAFFET: Casull .454 Magnum. You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
SYKES: Only holds five.
MAFFET: Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder. Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
SYKES: No... two.
