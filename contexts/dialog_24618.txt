CLAIRE: Hi. Just checking to see if you're here.
MIKE: I came on at 8:00.
MIKE: You all right?
CLAIRE: Yeah.
MIKE: I'm sorry about what happened.
CLAIRE: Listen, that was my fault.
MIKE: I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the can" the way he did."
CLAIRE: If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me. I think he heard me peeing! I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
