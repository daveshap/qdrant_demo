Members of Congress are looking at appropriations control to seek accountability for Trump's alleged conduct in asking the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden's family. Is using Congressional appropriations as leverage to investigate a political rival a formal legal issue?
Democrats in the House and Senate, as well as some Republicans, are [pushing for accountability](https://www.apnews.com/e5607bb2be55436f824515b35539a97e) on Trump's [alleged behavior](https://www.apnews.com/94fdeaddc6b34c02b97278674b87541e) with Ukraine.

The specific area of concern is that President Trump used [appropriated Congressional spending](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ukraine/trump-administration-reinstates-military-aid-for-ukraine-idUSKCN1VX213) on foreign aid as leverage to get the newly elected leader of Ukraine to investigate Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his son (From Source 1):

> Democrats, and some Republicans, urged the White House to be forthcoming amid the reports that the president pressured Ukraine’s leader to help investigate political rival Joe Biden at the same time the administration was withholding $250 million in aid to the Eastern European nation.

[Furthermore](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/us/politics/trump-un-biden-ukraine.html): 

> Mr. Trump has acknowledged that he mentioned the Bidens in a call on July 25 with the new Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, and people familiar with the call have said Mr. Trump repeatedly urged Mr. Zelensky to speak with one of his personal lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani has been pushing Ukraine aggressively to look into the Bidens and the origins of material that implicated Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, in 2016.

I have a few of questions on this topic:

1. Do Presidential powers allow a President to dictate terms on appropriated Congressional aid to a foreign country? For example, suppose President Trump said Ukraine would not receive aid until they pledged to hold a public referendum on joining NATO. Can a President set such conditions on Congressional approved aid?

2. Specific to the ongoing Ukraine story with President Trump, are there any legal issues raised when a President asks a foreign nation to investigate US citizens? What about political opponents, other groups?

3. On question two, does adding the layer of withholding appropriated Congressional aid complicate that legal analysis?
