BILL: You want us to move in here?
PATRICK: That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
MAURICE: Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
PATRICK: Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool. But I think we can do better.
BILL: You soundin' like the old man now.
PATRICK: I believe in you guys. You are the real shit. And you know it. Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too. Now all Im asking is that everybody do their part. We'll move some shit in
BILL: Pat's right. It'll be fun.
