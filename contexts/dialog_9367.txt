GONZO: God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts... This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
DUKE: Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
DUKE: I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
GONZO: Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
