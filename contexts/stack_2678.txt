How to replicate a polygon over several points with different locations in Arcgis? I have two shapefiles, one is a polygon and the other is points.I would like to create a new shapefile which has the shape of the polygon in all the places that there is points. I would like to replicate the polygon under the points.1= the polygon that I want to replicate. 2= the points represents the location where the replicated polygons should be (one polygon per point).
