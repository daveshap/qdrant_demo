Quality and Saftey role description????
Potentially looking to get a job in this area and have found a couple openings where I live (manufacturing companies; gas, pharma ect), was just wondering if there was anyone around that has/had this role and could breakdown what a entry level/recent graduate would be doing on the daily in this role?? + recommendations with how to approach?

Any info would be greatly appreciated!
