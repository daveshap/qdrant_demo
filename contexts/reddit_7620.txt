Does your PI introduce you to their peers/colleagues?
Someone is visiting and one of my advisors introduced him to our post doc but not to me when I walked by them. 

He has introduced me to another colleague of his. 

Just wondering about your experiences.

Edit: Should I be introducing myself to these colleagues or is that considered rude? I only see them in passing as I have work to do, but I've always been bad at socializing unless I need to.
