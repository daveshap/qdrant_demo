Hiring someone with a disability?
(If this isn’t the correct place to post this, can someone please direct me to the right place, Thank you.) 

I know this is kind of a weird question to post and I’m more then certain that many managers or owners of their own businesses would never admit to this, but I’m genuinely curious as to how some of you feel after hiring someone with a disability and seeing them perform their job duties very slowly. I ask this, because I’m a person who has a physical disability (mitochondrial myopathy) that limits my movement and I sometimes feel like I’m slowing everyone down. That saying of; “time is money” always runs through my mind whenever I feel or see my managers eyes watching me as I go about my job duties. I work in a small retail store and though, I know that this job isn’t particularly a right fit for someone who suffers from my illness, I needed something to generate revenue and I WAS NOT going to depend on SSI or the government at the age of 24 to take care of me because I truly believe I can at least do a simply entry level job. Anyway, as I was saying, I work very slowly at times due to fatigue and not being able to carry heavy loads and every time my manager and I talk, I feel like there’s some type of animosity because I truly believe he/she regrets hiring me but doesn’t want to fire me due to the fear of me suing for wrongful termination under the ADA law. Also I want to add that they knew I had a disability prior to them hiring me. My question lies in; As a manager (anyone in this sub) do you ever regret hiring someone who suffers from a disability because you feel their slowing down the work flow? Would you ever admit to, said employee, that you don’t think the job is a right fit for them because of their illness?
