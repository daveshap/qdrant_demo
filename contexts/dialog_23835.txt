MAYA: Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
MILES: Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
MAYA: I had class.
MILES: Well, nice to see you now.
MAYA: You too.
JACK: You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
MILES: He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
JACK: Huh.
MAYA: You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
MILES: Great. What's the latest we can get there?
MAYA: About two-thirty.
MILES: Okay.
MAYA: Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
MILES: No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
MAYA: What rehearsal dinner?
