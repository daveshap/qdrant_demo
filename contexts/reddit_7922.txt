What to do with postdoc that I am collaborating with?
I am working with him on a project and when the PI is not around. He is always trying to rush me off the phone. I know time is of the essence but I barely get a chance to discuss what we are working on. 

I am not asking for a lengthy discussion but 10 minutes to get feedback on how I am doing. He just makes edits and gives like a sentence of advice and that is it. I feel like I am going to get a paper out of this. However, I did not anticipate this work style.
