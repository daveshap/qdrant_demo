NORMAN: Where are you going in such a hurry?
BETH: I have to reset the sub.
NORMAN: Forget the sub.
BETH: Don't bother me, Norman.
NORMAN: It's not worth the risk.
BETH: It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people. And there's only three of us left now.
NORMAN: You, me and Harry?
BETH: You, me and Harry. He's asleep.
NORMAN: Wake him, then. Let's go. Get outta --
BETH: We can't. The storm. The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here. And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
NORMAN: Four days?
BETH: Get the helium out of our bloodstream. We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
BETH: Maybe you should go. To the sub.
NORMAN: Why should I go?
BETH: You should know how it works. Just in case.
NORMAN: In case you die, too?
BETH: I don't trust Harry to do it.
NORMAN: I would. But my suit --
BETH: I fixed your suit.
NORMAN: You fixed my suit?
BETH: You don't trust me?
NORMAN: But I don't know how --
BETH: You press a button, Norman. It's not brain surgery. Here, go ahead. You only have 15 minutes to reset it. Go on, Norman...
