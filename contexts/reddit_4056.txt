Chronic frustration with the dating scene (Venting)
(31 M), it feels like I've been dealt a bad hand after bad hand for years now.    
    
Since 2013, I've tried to put myself out there (I.E. OkCupid); nothing ever came of it. Over the successive years, if there is an app, I probably used it. In all that time only four first dates, with nothing after. Last year I decided to take a hiatus from the apps.    
    
Being a regular at a local gym, another regular decided to play matchmaker and introduced me to a mutual friend last Monday. It was non-stop texting until last Thursday (went out to diner) then radio silence. Taking the higher ground I sent a follow-up on Saturday with no response. I only found out from the mutual friend the "nice guy" excuse. I would have accepted hearing it from her directly instead of acting immature and avoiding it (We're adults here).   
    
Taking a stab at the apps again, by god they all look the same and quite frankly boring and unoriginal. Within minutes I uninstalled.     
   
I never had success back in school, work is a sausage fest. People saying "you'll find someone" is increasing sounding hollow and paying lip service.    
    
Edit, I never excepted this to blow up like it did. Fortunately the information may not just help me out, but others as well
