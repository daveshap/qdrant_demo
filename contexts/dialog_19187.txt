MICKEY: Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
MALLORY: Are we in a big hurry?
MICKEY: You got something you want to do?
MALLORY: Yeah.
MICKEY: By all means, knock yourself out.
MALLORY: Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
