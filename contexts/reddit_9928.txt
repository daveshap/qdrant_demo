Academic advising position interview - strategies and advice. (repost from /r/AskAcademia)
I will be interviewing for an academic undergraduate advising position at a major public higher ed institution that also happens to be my alma mater. I hold a humanities PhD, have taught for well over five years, both as a TA and faculty, and thus, have extensive student advising experience. That said, I am not the usual student advising applicant with an advanced degree in education. I've been informed that the phone interview will last 30 minutes and involve "5 questions."

Is anyone here able to provide advice on interviewing for an admin position (especially student advising) at a large public? I've done a number of academic faculty interviews, so I have a basic understanding of explaining research, teaching and mentoring philosophies. That said, any advice regarding preparation and performance for an admin position would be very much appreciated.

EDIT: Thanks to all your wonderful advice, I have been invited for an on-campus interview!
