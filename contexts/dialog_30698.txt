HEATHER: Dylan, it's breakfast. Not arts and crafts What?
CHASE: You get any sleep last night?
HEATHER: More or less. Dylan, time to get dressed. I'm late.
DYLAN: You going away?
HEATHER: Just for a few hours. Julie'll be with you.
CHASE: Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
HEATHER: Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
CHASE: Hasn't been another call, has there?
