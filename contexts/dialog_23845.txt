MILES: Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
JACK: Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
MILES: No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
JACK: You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
MILES: Keep it elevated.
MAYA: Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
MILES: It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me. And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
MILES: Well?
JACK: I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
MILES: Good thing you have a voice-over career.
JACK: Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
MILES: That's thoughtful.
JACK: Yeah.
