No evaluation process, no direction to how to get a promotion. Advice? Similar situations?
I’m in a very strange position as there’s really no evaluation process (even when I ask for it) and HR hasn’t been helpful with how to get promotions/raises. I know sometimes it’s checking off boxes or it’s the job description changing significantly.

In my previous jobs, I went through an evaluation process and as the job description changed I got a promotion or they mentioned potential merit raises.

When I asked for an evaluation, I got a “you doing okay? Want to cover anything?”
I’m now asking (5-6 months into my job) to sit down and review my job description, update it, and talk about professional development opportunities (which they also don’t provide, they provide just for faculty).

I’ve also gotten to the point where I’m the point contact for everyone in my department and I’m the one who goes above and beyond to make sure the office doesn’t fall apart (promise it’s not an exaggeration).

Yes I could stop giving 110%, but that’s not who I am. So that’s not really an option.
