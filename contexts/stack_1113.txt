Connection issues with Azure DB from SSMS I am currently making a connection to Azure DB from SSMS using public wifi. For the past few days, I was able to connect SSMS to Azure DB without any issues by adding the current ip address into the server firewall. However, today the following error came up:Error Message<blockquote>  A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and the SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections.<br>  (provider: TCP Provider, error: 0 -No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.)(Microsoft SQL Server Error: 10061)<br>  No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.</blockquote>Things that I have tried to correct itCheck and retyped server name, login and passwordEnable all SQL Server Config protocolManually add ip address to azure SQL Server firewallEnable SQL server through firewallHowever the issue is still not resolved, so what should I do?Results from pinging the name of the Azure SQL server<blockquote>  Pinging eastasia1-a.control.database.windows.net [191.234.2.139] with 32 bytes of data:    Request timed out.
