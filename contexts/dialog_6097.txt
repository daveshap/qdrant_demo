ACTIVIST: I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
CUSTOMER: What the hell is that?
ACTIVIST: That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
CUSTOMER: You're shittin' me.
ACTIVIST: You think I'm shitting you...
CUSTOMER: What's this?
ACTIVIST: It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
CUSTOMER: Unnhh!
ACTIVIST: He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
DANTE: Excuse me, but...
ACTIVIST: This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
CUSTOMER: Well, if it's already too late...
ACTIVIST: It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead. Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
CUSTOMER: It's not the same.
ACTIVIST: It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
CUSTOMER: Jesus!
ACTIVIST: It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
CUSTOMER: I'll just take the gum.
DANTE: Fifty-five.
ACTIVIST: You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
DANTE: Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
ACTIVIST: No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
DANTE: If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
ACTIVIST: Okay. I'm sorry about that.
CUSTOMER: Pack of cigarettes. What's that?
ACTIVIST: This? How long have you been smoking?
