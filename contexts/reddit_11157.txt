That most guys on Reddit refuse to accept that sexism against women is a problem.
Almost every time I or someone else mentions anything along the idea that in today's society women are still treated as lesser than men, or have it worse than men, the comment is down voted and has some guy talking about one of the problems men face. This is something I have thought about for countless hours and is very important to me. I'm not some crazy SJW, I don't think men are evil or should be treated as lesser to women, and I don't deny that there are some struggles that men have to face. But this idea most guys on this site have that just because there are some problems that men face that women don't means that men have it just as bad as women seriously bothers me. It bothers me even more that when someone on this site does try and voice the opinion that women do have it harder, they are ridiculed for it. I thought this was a place where different ideas where accepted or at least respected. I do have so much more to say but I'd rather not write a wall of text.
