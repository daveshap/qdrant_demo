What evidence is there that the intelligence briefings provided to Trump don't vary much from day to day?
PEOTUS Trump has recently claimed that he isn't attending many of his intelligence briefings because, he says, it's more or less the same thing most days. Is this true? To what extent do PDBs present new information day to day? Are there records available on this?
