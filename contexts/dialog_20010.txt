CHARLIE: ...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
BETTY: I am?
CHARLIE: Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
CHARLIE: I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
BETTY: Umm, I don't think that...
CHARLIE: Wait. Let me get this out. I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
BETTY: Thirty-two?""
CHARLIE: Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think? You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
BETTY: I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
CHARLIE: No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day
BETTY: I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
CHARLIE: I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine... Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea... I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
BETTY: I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
CHARLIE: Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
