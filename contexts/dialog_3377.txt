TINY WOMAN: Captain Mertin?
MERTIN: What want ye, girl child?
TINY WOMAN: I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
MERTIN: I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
TINY WOMAN: I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
MERTIN: Aye. Speak then if ye must.
TINY WOMAN: Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?
