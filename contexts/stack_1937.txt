Sentence Fragment? \"The [adverb] [noun] [verb], the [adverb] [noun] [verb].\" I apologize if this has been asked before, but I cannot find a clear answer.I am analyzing a statement and attempting to determine if it is a fragment or complete sentence. This is the general idea of the structure:<blockquote>  -The faster I ran, the stronger I became.    -The harder the wind blew, the colder the air felt.    -The longer I looked, the more confused I was.    The [adverb] [subject] [verb], the [adverb] [subject] [verb].</blockquote>Is this sentence structure considered a full statement, or a fragment?
