BLEEKER: You're being really immature.
JUNO: What?
JUNO: That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
BLEEKER: Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
JUNO: Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
BLEEKER: Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, Oh

BLEEKER: Oh my God, SHUT UP!
JUNO: What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
BLEEKER: No...
JUNO: Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
BLEEKER: Wait, let me take that.
JUNO: Huh?
BLEEKER: You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
JUNO: Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
MARK: Wow. That shirt is working hard.
JUNO: Is Vanessa here?
MARK: Nope. We're safe.
JUNO: Cool.
MARK: Come on, I have something for you.
JUNO: Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
MARK: Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
JUNO: Oh God, you're one of those guys...
MARK: You're gonna like this, I promise.
