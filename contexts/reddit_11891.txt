Can you really be friends with an ex?
My very first relationship ended two weeks ago. It was mutual and I'm not too upset about it. Too much distance and emotional drift wasn't making their depression and my suspected depression any better. I've been working through it and im mostly covered in regards to emotional recovery and growth. There's a promise of friendship and a restart in the distant future but i'm wondering if it's possible to really be friends again. I'm not counting on becoming a couple again and currently have no interest of doing so. I do miss having them around to talk about random things but i've been trying to give them some space and not contacting them at all. I'm just writing here mostly for validation and some kind of permission or time frame where i can start talking to them again. I know i can talk to them whenever but in general, what is a good amount of no contact? Also if anyone had self books for communication or self-care to recommend would be awesome and greatly appreciated.
