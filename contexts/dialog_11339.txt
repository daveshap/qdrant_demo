LAMBEAU: I didn't see you at the reunion.
SEAN: I've been busy.
LAMBEAU: You were missed. How long has it been since we've seen each other?
SEAN: Since Nancy died.
LAMBEAU: I'm sorry, that damn conference--
SEAN: I got your card.
SKYLAR: Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
WILL: No.
SKYLAR: Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
WILL: I really don't 'date' that much.
SKYLAR: You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
WILL: No I haven't...
SKYLAR: Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
WILL: No I wasn't...
SKYLAR: Yes you were.
WILL: I was kinda' hopin' to get a good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss."
SKYLAR: Oh, you will?
WILL: No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
SKYLAR: Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
