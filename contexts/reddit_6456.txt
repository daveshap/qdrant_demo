Company created my position last year, now hiring a duplicate?
Has anyone been in a situation where they were still relatively new to a company, and the employer hired essentially your clone? Business is growing in our field, however it makes me question what the long term plan is for myself and for the role.

I joined my company in August 2019 and the role (sales mgr) was new. We have added 10% new headcount since I joined in my area, but to add another non revenue generating middle manager seems a bit strange

My boss of course says this came his boss, and not to worry I would be apart of the interview process etc etc.
