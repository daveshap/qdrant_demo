Just got my dream job offer!!!!
And had to come here to thank all of you :) this sub has given me such great career tips, tricks, info, etc. So happy and thankful to have gotten a job offer for an academic advisor position-- something I never thought would happen given the competition and many qualified applicants. Couldn't have done it without this sub!
