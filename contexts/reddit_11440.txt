Mixed raced relationships
Hi everyone! I hear a lot of good things about this community so I thought I would lay out something that's been on my mind for quite sometime. 

Right now I'm 18 years old and I'm studying business at a good university - I'm at a very happy point in my life. But right now something that's been on my mind is of course love and relationships. I've been falling for a girl that's of Asian descent and I really adore her in every way possible. However, I find it difficult to imagine anything beyond a friendship because of cultural issues. I'm of Indian (Hindu) descent with my parents both being from India and having strong religious ties to it. Even if I wanted to start a relationship with her right now I wouldn't be able to because of my parents. The idea of being stuck with marrying someone with the same last name as me some day really bothers me - regardless if I wanted to pursue a relationship right now or not. If I end up dating someone from another part of India my parents won't be satisfied - let alone someone of a completely different cultural descent! I don't know how to handle this, I feel like it's holding me back and it's just something I don't like thinking about at the back of my mind. Any ideas?
