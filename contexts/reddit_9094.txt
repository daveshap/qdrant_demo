I have $20.41 in savings
And I am so proud of myself!! I've never had this much in savings before.

Two months ago I was homeless with a young baby. One month ago I signed a lease to an apartment and started working. Now I have all of my bills covered for this month *and* next, and I even have some money in a savings account!!

If you're going through a hardship, remember the bad times are just times that are bad.
