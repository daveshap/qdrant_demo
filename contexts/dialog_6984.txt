FRIDA: Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
JENNIFER: You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
FRIDA: No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
FRIDA: Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
JENNIFER: Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
