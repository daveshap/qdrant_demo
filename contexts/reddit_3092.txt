How do I quit a job I started recently on good terms?
Hey everyone,

So I recently started a job (let's say around 2 weeks ago) . Unfortunately, I just got a job offer that I didn't expect to get  from my dream company... How do I quit without burning a huge bridge? Despite the short amount of time, everyone's been great and accommodating to me. It just feels disrespectful for me to do this, but this is also a company that I've wanted to work for since I was a kid. 

Thanks for the help! 

edit: thank you guys so much for your advice! you guys are amazing!
