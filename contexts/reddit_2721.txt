Have you ever used LinkedIn profile updates to passively signal you your employer/manager that you may be looking?
I am currently seeking a promotion that I feel strongly that I am meeting the criteria for, and has been dangled in front of me for the past year. I have a feeling that they think I will not leave due to them paying for most of my MBA and since I have spent my entire 5 year career here, so they continue to give me the “almost there” pitch for promotion. I plan to start applying for new opportunities in the next two weeks and plan to make LinkedIn updates as well. I have read that I should make them private to not notify your network, but wonder if anyone has used this as a passive way to notify that you may be looking and gain a bit of leverage?  
I feel fairly safe in my role due to the niche nature and learning curve associated with it, but wonder what thoughts are in terms of positives and negatives of this approach.

Thanks!
