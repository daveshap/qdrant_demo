ANDY: Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality. You interested in an automatic?
TRAVIS: I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
ANDY: That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
TRAVIS: How much for everything.
ANDY: The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
TRAVIS: How much to get a permit to carry?
ANDY: Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
TRAVIS: Nah, this'll be fine.
ANDY: You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
TRAVIS: Is there a firing range around?
ANDY: Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
ANDY: You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
TRAVIS: Huh?
ANDY: Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
TRAVIS: Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next.
ANDY: It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over.
TRAVIS: They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first. You got anything to carry these in?
