HAMMER: Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
MRS. CARVER: I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
MRS. CARVER: So. Do you have a name?
ESTHER: It's Esther.
MRS. CARVER: From the story of Purim. Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
HAMMER: Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
ESTHER: I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
