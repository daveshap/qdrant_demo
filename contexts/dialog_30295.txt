KATHY: Hi.
GALVIN: Hi. How are you doing?
GALVIN: I've been meaning to come in a long time.
KATHY: You live in the neighborhood?
GALVIN: Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
KATHY: How old is he?
GALVIN: Four. You're great with these kids.
KATHY: Thank you.
GALVIN: You're really... You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
KATHY: Who told you that?
GALVIN: Mrs...
KATHY: Mrs. Simmonds.
GALVIN: Yes.
KATHY: I used to be a nurse.
GALVIN: That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
