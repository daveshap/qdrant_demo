LITTLE OLD LADY: So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
BIALYSTOCK: I can't take my eyes off you. How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
LITTLE OLD LADY: Rudolfo, you dirty pig! Pull over.
BIALYSTOCK: Good. That's enough. We'll do the rest on Thursday. That's a good girl. It's always such fun to see you.
