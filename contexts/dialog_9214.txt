GRANT: General, I've heard some wild ones. But this takes it.
CARTER: We can shrink an Army -- with all its equipment -- and put it in a bottle cap. That's why we call it <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
GRANT: If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
CARTER: They have... But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
GRANT: I assume Benes knows how to control it.
CARTER: That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
GRANT: They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
CARTER: And take a little trip with them...
GRANT: Trip? Where to?
CARTER: Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
GRANT: You mean <I'm> going along?
CARTER: As part of the Crew.
GRANT: Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
CARTER: Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
GRANT: But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
CARTER: It's only for an hour --
GRANT: Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.
