EVE: Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
TROY: I know...I know. You did the right thing.
EVE: Oh, no!
TROY: What?!
EVE: Oh, my God!
ARON: He'll catch him. Hi. This is Nina Aron. I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
EVE: No! Not the police! Don't call them!
ARON: I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
EVE: No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
ARON: Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
EVE: You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
ARON: And now you must let me be the judge of that!
EVE: I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
ARON: Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
ADAM: The key to my hotel room! I want you to have my baseball cards! And please be sure to pay my bill!
ARON: Young man, stop right there!
