Getting a masters degree online and abroad? International
American student here. I have one more year until I complete my bachelor's in information technology at a community college. I'm on the prowl to get my masters but everywhere in my state it's just so expensive. Lowest price was 48k to complete a master's. That's a down payment on a house! I heard studying at a foreign University for your master's is a much cheaper option. I cannot afford to go abroad as I live paycheck to paycheck. Does anyone know any international universities that are less than 15k tuition? For online coursework?
