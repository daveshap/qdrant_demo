Measure to compare quality of clustering results from different datasets I have a correlation matrix that reflects the structural connectivity patterns of the human brain. I have this matrix for a population of subjects (73 subjects, so I have 73 correlation matrices originated from different datasets).I applied a clustering algorithm to each matrix for a variety of number of clusters (from 2 to 5 clusters). Now, I want to choose the optimal number of clusters k. I'd like to find the same good k for all the 73 subjects, and therefore I want to do the choice based on the consistency across the population. So for each clustering solution (k=2,...,5), I want to measure its consistency for the entire population. So, is there any statistical measure that I can use to compare the clustering results between the different datasets (subjects)? (If anything is not clear, please let me know)
