EVE: Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
CHANCE: No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
EVE: Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
CHANCE: He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
EVE: It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.
