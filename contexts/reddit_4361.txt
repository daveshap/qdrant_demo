Apologies for being remiss
When I started this subreddit years ago, I was in a dark place. I felt alone and afraid and unwelcome most anywhere I went. I truly started it as a haven where I knew I would be accepted as it was a place of my own creation. However, since then, much has happened and I've grown a lot, learned a lot, and healed a lot. In that time, however, I also forgot many things- one being this subreddit. I found this once again by accident this evening and am honestly shocked and amazed at how it's grown. While I'm saddened to see so many people suffering from the horrible affliction that is mental illness, I'm also delighted to see so much support and banding together in such a tough situation. I also, however, see the need for an active moderator on a subreddit which hosts some of the most vulnerable going through the most difficult situations. For my absence, I am sorry. While I cannot say I will return and be that moderator (as I neither have the time and it would be detrimental to my own mental health), I can tell you I will work to find the appropriate replacement who will both reinvigorate this subreddit and act as a shield to potentially harmful content and information. It is truly a pleasure to be in the presence of so much love and support. Please continue your efforts, and may you all heal quickly. Thank you for trusting me and this subreddit as somewhere you can call home when there's nowhere else.
