MARY: He's a nice guy, isn't he?
TUCKER: Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
MARY: Not long at all, but I really like him. Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
TUCKER: That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
MARY: I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
TUCKER: Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
HEALY: Fuck!!
MARY: Huh... that's strange.
TUCKER: I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
MARY: No no no, Tucker, thank you.
TUCKER: I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
MARY: I appreciate you looking out for me.
