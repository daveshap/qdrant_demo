KATKA: I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
DOUG: Whatever!
CHRIS: Anything in it?
DOUG: No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
CHRIS: Never heard of K-MART?
DOUG: I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
CHRIS: Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
DOUG: It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
CHRIS: What's that? Free!
DOUG: Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
CHRIS: Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
