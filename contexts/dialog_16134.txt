ALYSSA: His parents took his car. They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.

ALYSSA: He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
SAM: He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
ALYSSA: This is serious! I don't have my license. He was my ride.
SAM: I'm sorry. I'm just here to shower.
