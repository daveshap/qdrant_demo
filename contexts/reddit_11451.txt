I feel like I'm shallow.
I went on a coffee date with a chick I met on OkCupid. She was nice and interesting, but she was also had kinda bad teeth, was pretty fat and had a hunch, think pear shaped but...more than that. There's no way I'd take it to the next level.

Now I'm pretty lonely, don't know anybody since I just moved to my town, and I'm not exactly a prize pig. I've dated girls that are overweight, but this was over the top. I feel like a piece of shit.
