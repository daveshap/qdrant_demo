LEX: Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
HAWK: Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
JAM: They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
HAWK: They're what?
JAM: She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
TRIP: That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
LEX: If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
JAM: Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
HAWK: All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
JAM: Check.
