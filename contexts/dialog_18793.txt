SAUNDRA: I... I .....
BRUCE: You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
SAUNDRA: I wanted to let his family know....
BRUCE: Know what ? That it was your fault ?
SAUNDRA: It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
BRUCE: So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
ZACH: That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
JOHNNY: <<belch>>
ZACH: Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
JOHNNY: The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
BRUCE: Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
SAUNDRA: Okay.
SAUNDRA: You okay ?
BRUCE: Fine...
