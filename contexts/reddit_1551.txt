College Board is the greediest non-profit out there! (+ facts)
Pay for the SAT, pay for the SAT Subject tests, pay to send your SAT scores, pay for test prep materials, pay for AP tests, pay to send AP scores, pay to take the PSAT, PAY TO BE CONSIDERED FOR FINANCIAL AID AT MOST UNIVERSITIES (CSS Profile), if your international pay to submit tax returns (IDOC service), and that's just what we have to pay for applications! Imagine how much more we have to pay this monopoly through other tests, like CLEP, in and after college!

ARGGGH

FACTS:

This "non-profit" had a revenue of US$ 840 MILLION in 2014!

Their CEO made US$ 1.3 MILLION in 2009!

They sell our data for 0.43 $ to Universities and advertisers!

This poor "non-profit" is being FUNDED, as in given EXTRA money, by various foundations, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation!

They make our broke asses even more broke by forcing us to pay money to be considered for financial aid, which we have to do because WE ARE BROKE in the first place.

and most importantly they KEEP ON REUSING OLD SAT TESTS and can not control the test's security.

PS if you work for the College Board, get your f...ing act together and actually behave like a real non-profit and not like an insatiable, money-grubbing Forbes Global 500 company!
