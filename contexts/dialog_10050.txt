ALICE: Cabin B is ready.
STEVE: Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
STEVE: That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
ALICE: You told her to sweep the courts.
