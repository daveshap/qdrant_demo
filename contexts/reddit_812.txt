Friends w benefits
Ok kinda long but theres a guy who im almost 99% sure would be fwb with me and we matched on tinder and everything and weve talked like twice in our life and hes kinda sorta friends with one of my friends. And he keeps doing weird things around me when hes with his friends that makes me feel like he knows ab my plan to ask him to be fwb bc i told my friend who knows him and she cant keep a secret but whatever. But hes also friends with my ex and his whole friend group and theyre all like gross high school guys who are probably definitely gonna make a big deal about it and i dont want it to be weird i just want smth casual (obviously lmao). So like 

1.) how tf do i ask him ab it? Do i just go for it and ask him or what idek lol and 

2.) do guys talk about like the specifics of fuck buddy stuff with friends? Like if smth weird happens (idek weird stuff happens during sex its normal but whatever) is he gonna go telling ppl?
