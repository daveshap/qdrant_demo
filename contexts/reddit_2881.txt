Is it worth learning a language purely for the career aspect?
I am considering learning Spanish purely for the possibility of it helping in the future.  I am not sure what career path I want to pursue at all and just wondering if I should learn a language.   Is it worth using up precious time to learn purely for a career?   How common are bilingual bonuses?  

Basically, I'm wondering, would it help me earn any extra money on average.   Again, no Idea on what career path I'm going to take. 

Thank you so much for any answers!
