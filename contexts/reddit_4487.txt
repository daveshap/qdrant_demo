Been one whole year since the day I tried to kill myself and I’m happier than ever
I was fighting depression for 6 years with it getting exponentially worse. First it was just once every couple of months for a day or so all the way to I was lucky if I got half a week where I didn’t feel like shit in a month. I met someone who I opened up to, she convinced me to get help and I’ve been so much happier since. Has it been easy? No of course not. The depression will always try to find ways to sneak in things to make your life worse like pushing people away from you, making you believe you are a burden on others, all that horrible shit. But it does get better, you just have to keep on going until it does. Even the brightest sources of lights in our world like Robin Williams can be extinguished by this. 

Today I am somewhat organized in college when I thought I would have died before I graduated from high school. I’m happy and life feels amazing again. Sure sometimes there will be a part of me that misses the depression, but when I look back at how I was and how I am now, I know it’s all worth it. I know it’s worth it when my sister runs up and hugs me fighting tears saying “I’m so glad you are still here”

Sky Williams did a video called “A message to the depressed” that helped me out a lot. 

Depression is a raid boss. Do not try to 1v1 it like I did. It does damage over time so be sure to have plenty of supports with you and always remember that asking for help is not a weakness, but a sign of wisdom and strength.
