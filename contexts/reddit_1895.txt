A (Mostly) Rational Argument
Update: Rejected. But when one door closes, another opens.

Ok so I applied to Stanford REA, and, as the decisions come out tomorrow, I'm actively trying to digest the butterflies swarming in my stomach. All of my friends are applying to Ivies either EA or ED, and anxiety is HIGH at my school. So, here's my thinking, if you'll bear with me.

Earlier this year, I heard about a really interesting study that was done on two unique groups of people: people that had recently become paralyzed, and people that had recently won the lottery. As expected, the Lottery People (LP) were very happy, and the Paralyzed People (PP) were comparatively not. However, when these people were evaluated 1, 2, and 3 years later, both the PP and LP exhibited VERY SIMILAR levels of happiness.

So, what does this mean in the context of my favorite Reddit forum, A2C? Well, you can take it to mean whatever you want, but here's my rationalization: tomorrow at 7 pm, when I clear the textbooks off my desk, and sit down with my computer to check Stanford admissions, one of three distinct options will occur (deferral, rejection, acceptance). I'm really hoping for the big W, but realistic. (What's the acceptance, like 9 percent early and 3 percent regular decision? Geez) But regardless, whether I am crushed and paralyzed by the metaphorical "rejection bus," or get lucky in the "acceptance lottery," in 1, 2, or 3 years, I'll be just as happy either way.

College acceptance is not our worth. College acceptance is not our value. College acceptance is not a reflection of our character, intelligence, or aptitude. And most importantly, college acceptance is not going to determine our happiness. Good luck to everyone, and see you at 7 tomorrow.
