LLOYD: It's okay, everybody does that.
DIANE: I just don't want it to get too heavy. I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things. But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling? Do you know what I mean?
LLOYD: No.
DIANE: I just can't have any social life right now.
LLOYD: Don't worry about it. We're just having coffee. We'll be anti- social.
DIANE: Be friends?
LLOYD: Yeah. With potential.
DIANE: Friends with potential.
LLOYD: Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around. Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
DIANE: Yeah.
LLOYD: You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right. Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
DIANE: I'm doing alright.
LLOYD: Yeah. Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
DIANE: Yeah?
LLOYD: If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
DIANE: Right.
LLOYD: Okay, this is important...
DIANE: Am I wrecking my car?
LLOYD: Yeah, a little bit. Listen, this is important. When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
DIANE: Oh. I was putting the...
LLOYD: Little more gas. Ease it up. Hold on- minor setback. Now you feel confident, right?
DIANE: Yeah.
LLOYD: Now, go into second. Little more gas... Yeah! You can get this whole problem. Now, maybe you downshift to first?
DIANE: This is so noble.
LLOYD: Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
