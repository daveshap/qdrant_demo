WES: I want to rehire you. To find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
MAST: I've been on another case. All day. I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
WES: Do you really think Kristen is just a runaway?
MAST: Maybe. Maybe not.
WES: I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
MAST: Huh?
WES: You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
MAST: To his own daughter?
WES: To anybody.
