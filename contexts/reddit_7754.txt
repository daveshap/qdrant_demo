I got a Revise and Resubmit!
I just (finally) heard back from a journal I submitted to back in November. It's the first article I ever submitted, it's actually a revised version of my undergrad thesis in political and legal theory, and the reviews were surprisingly fair. 

I'm really excited to start working on the manuscript again. Wish me luck!
