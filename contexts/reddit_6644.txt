I made a blunder with a recruiter by not realising I had already applied for the job directly
Hi

About 20 days ago I was contacted by a recruiter for a role and they asked me if I had already applied and I said no and we went ahead with the process. A couple of days later as I was going through my application records I saw that I had indeed applied that role a day before the recruiter contacted me. I had completely forgotten about this as this company wasn't a big one and I had other companies on my mind. But here is where I really went wrong. Instead of letting the recruiter know as I soon as I realised I decided not to tell her because I assumed the CV I sent directly got lost in a sea of applications. I realise the error in this way of thinking but I just wasn't thinking properly. 

Anyway, I went ahead with the process through the recruiter and it got to the final stage interview. My final interview is on Monday and today I got a call from the recruiter saying they couldn't represent me as the company told them I had applied a day before. 

I feel awful for wasting the recruiter's time and making them look bad in front the company and I feel terrible about making myself look really bad in front of both the recruiter and the company. The recruiter isn't a major one in this country so I'm not too worried that being blacklisted by them is going to cost me a lot of future job opportunities although people's networks can be tight so who knows. And for the company I look foolish and disorganized at best and sneaky and selfish at worst. 

How do I handle this situation? I'm going to go back to the recruiter and confirm that I had applied and apologize for wasting their time. I haven't heard from the company directly yet and I'm too embarrassed to go ahead with the interview with the company (and to be honest this wasn't really a dream role anyway). Is there anything I can do?

Thanks
