WALKER: Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
FLETCH: Why not? Oh shit... really?
FLETCH: Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
WALKER: You broke it? You know the source?
FLETCH: Practically.
WALKER: What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
FLETCH: I have pictures of him. Dealing...
WALKER: So let's go! We run the pictures.
FLETCH: He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
WALKER: Who?
FLETCH: Well, there we're in a gray area.
WALKER: How gray?
FLETCH: I'd say charcoal.
WALKER: I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
FLETCH: Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God. I hope.
