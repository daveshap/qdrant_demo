Is the superfluid state a coherent state? In the normal to a superfluid phase transition, U(1) symmetry related to particle number conservation is spontaneously broken which seems to imply that the superfluid state is a state in which there is no definite number of particles? This property is shared by that of a coherent state or any arbitrary superposition of number operator eigenstates. Is there any property of the superfluid state (the condensate wavefunction) that is not shared by a coherent state?
