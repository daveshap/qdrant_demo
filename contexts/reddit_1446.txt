Does anyone else feel anxious BECAUSE they’re calm? It’s like wow I shouldn’t feel this good, time to feel like shit.
Today I took a 40 minute bath and focused on breathing. I also used an app called HeadSpace (can’t recommend this enough) to meditate and entered a very calm state of mind. Now it’s been 4 hours and I’m still sort of calm from it. But every couple of minutes or so I’ll question why I’m feeling so good, think I shouldn’t feel this good, and start to get anxious. Does anyone else share this feeling?
