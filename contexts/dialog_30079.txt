MUNNY: You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me... ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
THE KID: I could of... easy.
MUNNY: Yeah, I guess so.
THE KID: Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
MUNNY: Maybe I ain't.
THE KID: Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
MUNNY: He said that, huh?
THE KID: I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
MUNNY: Schofield? You from Schofield?
THE KID: On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
MUNNY: Oh.
THE KID: Well, how about it?
MUNNY: About what?
THE KID: Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
MUNNY: What for?
THE KID: For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
MUNNY: Jesus!
THE KID: Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
