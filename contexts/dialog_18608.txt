BETTY: No, I don't.
COCO: That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
BETTY: I can hardly wait, Coco.
BETTY: It's unbelievable!
COCO: I told ya.
BETTY: Wow!
COCO: Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler. Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
BETTY: Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
COCO: You got it! See you later honey.
