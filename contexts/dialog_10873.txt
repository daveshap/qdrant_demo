WINSTON: Hey man. What is it you're so involved with there?
STANTZ: Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
WINSTON: Are you a Christian, Ray?
STANTZ: Mmmhmmm.
WINSTON: Me, too.
STANTZ: Boy! Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
WINSTON: Do you believe in God?
STANTZ: No. But I liked Jesus' style.
WINSTON: Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
STANTZ: The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
WINSTON: Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
STANTZ: And the seas would boil ...
WINSTON: Right. And the sky would fall ...
STANTZ: Judgement Day ...
WINSTON: Yeah, Judgement Day.
STANTZ: Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
WINSTON: Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
