ELOISE: Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
GALBRAITH: Good evening.
ELOISE: You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
GALBRAITH: It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
ELOISE: Oh, that's so interesting!
GALBRAITH: Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
