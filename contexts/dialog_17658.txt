TANNER: What is it?
HALDEN: The Terrace. First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
TANNER: A hotel?
HALDEN: It's not used for anything.
HALDEN: Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric. He insisted it be kept vacant.
TANNER: Why?
HALDEN: He wouldn't say.
TANNER: Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
HALDEN: That's right.
TANNER: Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
HALDEN: Good question.
