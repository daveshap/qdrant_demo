KELLY: I can't believe you called Sam. What's the matter with you?
SUZIE: I'm scared, that's what. I'm scared there's no one to trust.
KELLY: You can trust me.
SAM: Kelly. Is Suzie there?
KELLY: Yes.
SAM: Shit. I was afraid of that. She left this garbled message on my machine. Can you calm her down?
KELLY: Why can't you come...
SAM: No! Christ. Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you. You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
KELLY: You know what it takes.
SAM: Then do it. I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight. We'll figure something out... Okay?
