Question about discrimination
Hello I have a quick question regarding a situation regarding a graduate school I am familiar with, and I was hoping to get some insight.

The Graduate School in question has many upper level defense and national security personnel acting as faculty, however the school is a non-profit, open institution eligible to anyone who applies and is accepted (including international students).

I'm hearing that a student from the Middle East (I believe from Iran), may be denied entry to the school because certain members of the faculty have a problem teaching subjects pertaining to national security to citizens of countries the USA does not have a good relationship with.

However, this student is already studying in the states on a F-1 Visa, and according to the government should be allowed to study wherever he chooses and gets accepted too. Mind you, this institution is public, not private, and the faculty member in question is only upset because he claims his security clearance won't allow him to work with this type of student.

Any thoughts?
