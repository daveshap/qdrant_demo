Need some guidance
I have two Bachelor degrees one is Psychology and the other in Sociology. I currently work in public service, I’ve been in public service for almost 5 years. I graduated in 2015 from my Undergrad. I do have the ability to take courses at my local community college to get refreshers if need be. 

I’ve been wanting to get further education.. my current career doesn’t bode well with raising a family.. so I’ve been looking at degrees that would open doors for me to be able to raise a family but also earn more then I am now. I earn about 52k a year.. 

I’ve been looking at becoming at Physical Therapy and Speech and Language Pathology. One you need only your Masters the other is a PhD. 

I am looking for feed back of people who have taken either course or know people who have careers in those fields and the pluses and minuses of each one.

If anyone has recommendations on other fields I should look into, I’m open for suggestions. ( the only things I struggle at is Math and some sciences). 

Thanks.
