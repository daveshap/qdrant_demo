BOBBY: Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
GRACE: Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
BOBBY: Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
GRACE: I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
BOBBY: You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now? How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
BOBBY: When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
GRACE: I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
BOBBY: I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
