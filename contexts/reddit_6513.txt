Why is management shirking responsibilities?
So lately I've become more involved in the training, safety, and quality side of my worksite, and I've noticed that pretty much across the board my local management and seemingly also the HQ management for my segment (business unit) have ignored major portions of several management systems. These management systems have complete guidance documents and clear standards, plus mountains of supporting documentation...so why is management failing to implement these systems?

Just wondering if anyone has any insight on what causes such neglect?
