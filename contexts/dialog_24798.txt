CARTMAN'S MOTHER: Goodnight, honey.
CARTMAN: Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
CARTMAN: Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: Oh.
CARTMAN: Mom...
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: Yes, hon?
CARTMAN: If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
CARTMAN'S MOTHER: Sure, hon. Goodnight.
