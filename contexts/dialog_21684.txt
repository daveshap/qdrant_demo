COULMIER: Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
MADELEINE: Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
COULMIER: But why must you indulge in his pornography?
MADELEINE: It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
MADELEINE: Ow!
COULMIER: But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
MADELEINE: I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
COULMIER: Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
MADELEINE: If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
