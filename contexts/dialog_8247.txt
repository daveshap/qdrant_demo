THE PATIENT: Am I being interrogated? You should be trying to trick me. Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur. Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted. Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
OFFICER: Why? Are you German?
THE PATIENT: No.
OFFICER: How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
THE PATIENT: You tell me. I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
OFFICER: This was your garden?
THE PATIENT: Or my wife's.
OFFICER: Then you were married?
THE PATIENT: I think so. Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
