Anyone else feel like they just aren’t meant for life?
I’ve been trying so hard for my loved ones sake. But I just can’t. I can’t fit the mold of living in a way that’s respectful to myself and others. I’m so full of self hate and doubt.I hate the person I’ve become. But it’s who I am now, it’s not a sickness anymore, it’s me. I don’t know any other way of life besides what I am now. I just don’t fit the mold of life. I can’t be happy I can’t be sad I’m just here. I’ve always romanticized suicide but the more I think about it the more of a viable and inevitable option it becomes. Is it so wrong of me to want to rid the world of myself, so I can stop fighting, stop feeling hollow. Is it selfish to do that? I don’t see how such a inter personal action could be considered selfish. Idk anymore
