How do I give someone I care about space without getting scared?
My girlfriend that I’ve been with for almost two years and I recently had a long talk that ended in us breaking up, she’s currently been dealing with some things personal things and we’ve both been so busy with work and schooling. She told me that she needs space and that she can’t talk to me while she’s having space, what should I do? It’s been on my mind since and every time I think about her I start to worry that she’s hurting or she’s gonna find someone else and then I end up texting her too much, and I just wanna find out how to deal with this until she’s ready to talk again.
