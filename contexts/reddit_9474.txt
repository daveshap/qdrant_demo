Thank You
I just wanted to thank everyone here as Ive been stalking this Reddit and following the advice in here. I officially now have 72 dollars in my savings for an emergency fund and that's just in the last 2 weeks. Next up is squeezing more money out of other places I didn't think it could be and try and have double that amount in savings by the end of the month!
