COLONEL ANDERSON: Report.
MILLER: Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
COLONEL ANDERSON: Resistance?
MILLER: A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
COLONEL ANDERSON: Casualties?
MILLER: Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
MILLER: They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
COLONEL ANDERSON: It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
MILLER: Yes, sir.
COLONEL ANDERSON: Where are your men now?
MILLER: Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
COLONEL ANDERSON: I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
MILLER: Sir?
COLONEL ANDERSON: There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle. I want you to take a squad up there. If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation. Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
MILLER: A private, sir?
COLONEL ANDERSON: He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
MILLER: But, sir...I...I...
COLONEL ANDERSON: Spit it out, Captain.
MILLER: Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense. Sir.
