Powering an onboard car GPS tracker I made a car tracker (a GPS/LTE module connected to an arduino that communicate to my web server) to log gps positionning data. I\u2019m planning to use this to track my new car in case it gets stolen.My initial thought would be to hot-wire the tracker to the car\u2019s 12V battery followed by a DC-DC converter to 5V.For redundancy I was planning to also power the tracker from an 18650 battery in case the thief disconnect the car\u2019s battery.My issue is that I\u2019d like to use the car\u2019s battery as the primary source of power, then the integrated 18650 battery. Finally the car\u2019s battery would be used to charge the 18650 when needed.The tracker would be low power usage (eg sending location every 10min, in sleep mode other wise).What would be the best way of powering such system without draining the car\u2019s battery with multiple DC converters ?
