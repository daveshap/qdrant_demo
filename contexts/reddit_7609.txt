Started a sexual harassment complaint and now lost friends
I finally decided to file a sexual harassment complaint against a student and somehow that student found out and turned 3 of my friends against me and made themselves look like the victim. Posting this here cuz I'm venting and idk why grad school is such a hotbed for abuse and harassment. And before u ask... Yes I did try telling them I didn't like the comments before going to a point of authority.
