CHARLIE: No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
WESLEY: A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
CHARLIE: You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
CHARLIE: Betty, Betty, Betty...
WESLEY: So what the fuck's a Finn?
CHARLIE: Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
WESLEY: Like... us?
CHARLIE: No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
BALLARD: What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
ROY: We think we know where Betty is.
BALLARD: Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
