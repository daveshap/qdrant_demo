I like what I do, but I feel I don't fit in my industry and it's causing anxiety.
I've been with my current (fairly large) company for a little over a year as a contractor. No idea whether or not a FT position will open. I'm not managment and I design/develop internal eLearning.

Where I've always struggled here is that I don't have the understanding of "the business" that my other teammates have. I've tried, but TBH I find it quite uninteresting so that makes it difficult for me to understand. Historically this wasn't expected of me so it's not something I'm accustomed to. 

I feel like I don't quite fit in because of this and it's frustrating. I also fear it could compromise my job here at some point. 

It is wrong to just want to be good at what I do, produce quality deliverables and learn about the business organically as I work with different teams rather than need to know/understand "bigger picture" plans management and other teams are involved in?

Maybe the corporate environment just isn't for me and I would do better where I felt what I did was making a difference or if I worked in an industry that I had some sort of passion for. I don't dislike the industry I'm in now, but I don't seem to have any type of passion for it.

This is causing me a lot of anxiety, and I'm not sure what responses I'm looking for, maybe just some validation that I'm not the only one feeling like this. It's not that I refuse to learn more about the business, I have genuinely tried and I just don't grasp the bigger picture. It makes me feel  very insecure and very much like a failure.
