MRS. GOODHALL: Do you know him?
LARCH: *No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
MRS. GOODHALL: I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
LARCH: Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
MRS. GOODHALL: You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
LARCH: Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
