JUD: There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
LOUIS: You're telling me.
LOUIS: It's funny, all right.
JUD: Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God. And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
JUD: Almost there, Louis.
LOUIS: You keep saying that.
JUD: This time I mean it.
JUD: This was their burying ground, Louis.
LOUIS: Whose burying ground?
JUD: The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
LOUIS: Why? For God's sake, why?
JUD: I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
LOUIS: I guess so...but...
JUD: You want to rest a bit before you start?
LOUIS: No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
JUD: Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
