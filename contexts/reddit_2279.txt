Literally, essays can be whatever you want them to be (but do avoid some topics)
Here’s some examples of essays I’ve heard/read over the years...

- How doing speech and debate regained a my confidence after a decade of speech therapy (my own common app) 
- Collecting piggy banks 
- Getting your head stuck between Ronald McDonald’s legs at a McDonald’s play place 
- A ton about being/hosting a foreign exchange student and how small things like a church bell or a sandwich connects cultures 
- Making meatballs with an older family member 

You can literally write about anything and everything you want to write about. However, there’s topics you should steer clear of. For example, don’t write about how amazing and inspirational your uncle is. AOs will be like “that’s great your uncle is so wonderful but we don’t know anything about you.” 

Avoid sob stories but if you decide to do one, focus on how you grew based on it. I literally wrote a supplemental essay about getting my first B and how it made me realize that it’s okay to ask for help and it’s great to build a relationship with my teacher. Even some personal growth stories from tragedy can be overdone. For example, talking about a sick relative and how you want to be a doctor/nurse to take care of people like them. 

Don’t write about mission trips. We had an AO visit our school and this is literally the first thing she said. They all just end up reading the same of how “you can still be happy and have nothing.” Also don’t write about sports unless you’re on an athletic scholarship. Like mission trip essays, they all just kinda read the same.


Edit: Also, I know many people are starting to write essays. Hear are my only two tips for they A) have your program read your essay aloud for you. It’ll help you pick up an any grammar errors/awkward phases. B) If essay is too long, search for “that” in your paper. A lot of use “that” a ton while writing and 99% of the time it’s unnecessary.

Edit 2.0: Yes, I’m just a [prefrosh. ](https://media.tenor.com/images/3af5b80db5b8f72f2cdb88429967657a/tenor.gif). The examples of the top of the posts are all examples from students I know who’ve gotten into T20 universities. The topics I said to steer away from are all examples I have heard straight from the mouths of AOs. Literally the head of admissions of one university told me about avoiding mission trips. Yes, you can write about these topics. Just some topics might come across better than others.
