BARBARA: Should we bring the police into this?
ROBERT: No, not yet.
SETH: She's not at that place you sent her?
ROBERT: She snuck away. And we haven't seen her. She hasn't come home.
SETH: Oh, man --
ROBERT: She hasn't called you?
SETH: I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through. I'm surprised she hasn't called.
