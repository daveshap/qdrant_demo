Do it by yourself
As a longtime subscriber to this sub, I’ve noticed a lot of people asking tips on how to meet people, get noticed, and dealing with loneliness. Not that this is some new advice that’s never been dispensed before, or even something clever. As a matter of fact, I’ve seen many people suggest this before. I just want to reiterate how important and effective this is: Go out by yourself!

Go to the bars by yourself. Go to shows by yourself. Go to coffee shops and read by yourself. Go for walks, do this, do that, and do it by yourself.

First of all, it will help you get comfortable in your own skin. The first few times might feel awkward or uncomfortable, but it’ll pass the more you do it. You’ll notice over time that you’re more approachable, and you will find that you’ll be more confident in approaching others. It all comes down to enjoying your own company out in the open. 

For me, it was going to the bars by myself when I realized how easy it really was to meet people. And also, don’t be afraid of getting friend zoned. Actually, it’s a good thing to think friends first. Value your new friend as a person and not as a potential companion. If you value them and their time, it may turn into something more, or they may be able to recommend you to one of their friends. 

Go out by yourself with the intention of just being social and increasing your social network. This will build confidence and attraction, and before you know it, you may have someone pining over you. Tackle the problem yourself, and truly, put yourself out there.
