FREDO: Who's that? Pentangeli? Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
PENTANGELI: Gotta check up on my boys. Hey, what's with the food? Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says. I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
FREDO: Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
PENTANGELI: You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie? We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
FREDO: We were all upset about that.
PENTANGELI: That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about. What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
FREDO: C'mon, I see what I can do.
