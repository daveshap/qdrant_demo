Confessed to my friend, she said no, but I'm glad I got it off my chest
I was on edge about my feelings towards my friend. Shes the only girl in our group of friends, so I wasnt sure whether I actually had feelings towards her or if it was just that she was the only girl I knew, but I decided fuck it go for broke. Told her how I felt, she said she wasn't looking to date and anyone and she didn't feel the same towards me, but is fine with still being friends. I will admit I'm a little upset as that isn't the ideal result, but I think its better than just bottling up the feelings. Still have feelings I think, and I don't know if/when they will go away, but I feel better getting it off my chest.
