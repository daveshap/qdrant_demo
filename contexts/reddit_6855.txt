Is my job being dissolved
10 of my coworkers and I were laid off due to COVID 19. Since then my boss has brought back everyone but 2 of us (myself included). I’ve heard through the grape vine my job responsibilities have been given to my Co workers who were brought back when I wasn’t hired back. My boss isn’t giving any straight answers about why me and my co worker were not rehires when they received their loan, basically I think my position may be dissolved. How can I get a straight answer on this. Any tips? I’ve never been through something like this..... also my boss referred to my co worker as her job title/ my job title (I work for a small company so she wouldn’t be in the department I think she literally is being given my title) the other day in an email- really makes me want to confront him about his plans for my return to work.
