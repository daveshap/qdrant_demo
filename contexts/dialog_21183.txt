MCKECHNIE: Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
KILLAINE: A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
MCKECHNIE: It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine. Where's the girl now?
KILLAINE: I don't know, sir.
MCKECHNIE: Well, find out. Who's covering her?
KILLAINE: Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
MCKECHNIE: This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
KILLAINE: I disagree, sir. As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
MCKECHNIE: Ye have, have ye?
KILLAINE: We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles. Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
MCKECHNIE: And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
KILLAINE: Yes, sir.
MCKECHNIE: Superintendent J. Mckechnie
KILLAINE: Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
MCKECHNIE: Superintendent J. McKechnie
MCKECHNIE: Physical description: Age 26
KILLAINE: I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
MCKECHNIE: But you still think she's innocent.
KILLAINE: I do.
