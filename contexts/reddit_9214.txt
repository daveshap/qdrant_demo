Medical and dental tourism, calling BS on moderator warning against it
I have to call bullshit on a moderator post warning people against medical tourism. I had great dental care in Mexico for a third of what it would cost here. Lots of people I know have as well. They also did not try to upsell me on unnecessary treatments that would have compromised the health of my teeth. I was told I needed SIX root canals in the US by an arrogant ass who said people who went to mexico were idiots. A 3D xray in mexico and proper evaluation led to NO root canals and no crowns. I had a great experience and my teeth are great now. Do your homework when traveling for dental or medical help, we have the internet now. (Also, Tijuana has killer gourmet mexican restaurants for the price of chipotle.)

American dentists and doctors will always fill you with horror stories because it's their competition, but you can get really shitty, incompetent work in the US. Our health "care" system is completely extortionist, don't be their pawn. In fact, medical care is the third leading  cause of death in the US now, and that's for people who can even get in -- many  don't even bother with getting care anymore because of how inaccessible it is. I don't, my deductible is crippling. I have mentally prepared that an acute injury or illness is likely going to be my death unless I can get to some place like mexico or thailand.

EDIT: Because a lot of people are asking, I went to American Biodental in Tijuana. I’m not saying they are the best but they were great for me. If you go to Tijuana check out Airbnb’s near the stadium, less than a mile from American Biodental. Uber is cheap and plentiful there.

EDIT 2: There are some good resources on this thread, thanks to everyone who contributed. Researching medical/dental tourism is a daunting task and first-hand reports are very helpful.
