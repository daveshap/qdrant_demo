WHALE: Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
CLAY: Just got away from me. Sorry to disturb you.
WHALE: I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea. I'd like it very much if you'd join me.
CLAY: I stink to high heaven right now.
WHALE: The honest sweat of one's brow. I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two.
WHALE: Or would you prefer a beer?
CLAY: No. Iced tea's fine.
WHALE: Splendid.
