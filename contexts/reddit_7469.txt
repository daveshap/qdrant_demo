Convince me NOT to pursue a MS/PhD in the Arts...
Considering pursuing graduate education in the Arts/humanities because I flat out love the reading and research. Helping others research their projects, doing my own, and teaching classes... I'd be enthralled in doing so! 

Tell me all the reason why I should NOT do so. I would love to work in academics, even as an adjunct!

By arts I'm referring to Psychology, English, and History. These are the areas I'm most interested.
