Does an ISP monitor user browsing history without a subpoena? I understand that an ISP has the ability to monitor a user's Internet browsing history, but do they actually do it without a subpoena/court order? And if they do, does the user's history look exactly how the history tab in Chrome looks, or is it categorized by site/date/something else
