How To Ask Her Out?
There this girl that I like and she show signs she likes me but I dont know how to ask her out. Like I don't know how to ask her without coming on to strong and freaking her out?

Also here's some details we're both a seniors, I'm a introvert and shy (but still know how to have a convo) and she's extrovert and talkative (but not around me) we knew each other for 3 years now and during those 3 years it seems like we had alot of chemistry like she would mess with my hair, touch my arm, hug me (unfortunately it was those side hugs which I think is a bad sign but adding it because I really don't know) and she also don't refer to me as "my friend Zayn" she just introduce me as Zayn.
