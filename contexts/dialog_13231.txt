DARWIN: So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
HAWK: Whatever. You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads. You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right. I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is. Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse? What am I saying, you did buy it...
DARWIN: Oh... Let's see. There are organizations that think we wanted the Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully
HAWK: If you're pausing for a thank you
DARWIN: Way to go, Alfie! How many people did you break that thing in front of. Good help's hard to find.
HAWK: I guess that's a no.
