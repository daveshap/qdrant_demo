It feels weird when I remember that suicide is such a scary thing for most people to discuss. I keep forgetting that most people aren't suicidal, and that even the slightest mention of it can make them panic.
At this point I've been suicidal for so long that it's just part of my life. It feels like you have your job, your hobbies, etc, and your suicidal thoughts. Apparently not for most people though.

Anytime anyone ever finds out that I'm suicidal, I'm actually pretty surprised by how much of a reaction it inspires in them.
