MARTY: Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
MIKEY: OK!
SCOOBY: So like, yeah…I caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like …still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviews…Y'know, I figure I can always drop out.
TOBY: So where'd you get in?
SCOOBY: Prnceton.
TOBY: But what did you get on your SATs?
SCOOBY: 200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.
MARTY: We used pull.
FERN: You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
TOBY: But what kind of pull did you have?
MARTY: I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
FERN: It's all about who you know.
MARTY: Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
FERN: He's right.
