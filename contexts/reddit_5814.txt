First Day: When to come clean with the manager
I have a plan to leave for a masters program abroad in which I'm already enrolled and taking classes (completely legal). 
So I haven't told this to anyone yet at work or during the hiring process because it never came up (until today).

Today during my onboarding call my manager was introducing me to the team and told me about this one girl that "she won't be with us for long, because she'll leave of masters when the Corona situation clears" and I thought should I tell him right now?! 
But I didn't. 
Anyways, my next semester will probably be online as well. So I have until march/April 2021 that I can work here. But my visa is going to get expired and I'll need to get it extended from abroad because the embassy in my home country doesn't give it. And for that I'll have to go Physically go there. 

I want to know when should I tell him that I have such plans as well?  I have exams next month as well. 

This other girl that's leaving had been working in the company for like 3 years already. So we're not in the same boat.
