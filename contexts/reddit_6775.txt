Any HR people out there that can shed some light on why you may contact a candidate asking for an interview and then completely not respond?
I received an email message from an HR talent acquisition manager yesterday morning saying they know I have applied for this position in the past and it was on hold, but now active again. She attached job description and said she would love to speak to me tomorrow (meaning today) or Monday 4/22.

Excited, because this would be a dream job for me, I responded within the hour about times for Friday. No response was received.

I normally would give it a few days, but because she offered up the next day or Monday, I know I needed to get this scheduled before the weekend. So I followed up with an email this morning just to “check in” to see if today would work and offered alternate times Monday.

The weirdest thing is, I received an automated out of office reply. It said she was away on business travel today and returning Monday with intermittent access to email/phone.

Did she make a mistake and realize she contacted the wrong person?! How did she not know she was traveling the next day?

This is the third time this has happened to me over the course of my career. Not a lot. This one I really care about, because as I said. I want this job!

So, what can i do if she never gets back to me??
