I think I’ve wasted my life.
I graduated with an undergraduate degree last May. I got my degree in Psych and planned on getting my masters. I have been working with kids with ASD and started my masters program in the fall. I thought this is what I wanted from life, but now I’m not sure. I waited to date until I was out of college and now it’s impossible. I’m so stressed out from work and school it has literally made me ill. I feel like I’m missing out on so much with my family, friends, and love life for what? To be stressed out and miserable my whole life? The problem is I don’t know what else I could/would do with my life. I just want to be happy with my choice and not regret my decisions years down the line.
