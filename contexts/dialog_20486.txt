HUEY: That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
ROY: Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it. Men? Well we can spare six for security...
HUEY: No thank you sister. Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
ROY: I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
