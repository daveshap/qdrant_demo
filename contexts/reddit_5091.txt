How many of you got the job after doing the homework?
To all the people who had to do take home homework pre or post interview, how many times have you or someone you know actually gotten the job? Because I'm starting to think it's all a scam.

Maybe I'm just bitter, but after spending a whole Saturday re-editing a blog post and creating a content calendar for an actual month long campaign in November, I felt like my time was wasted when I got the call today that I didn't get the position, and not "we're going with another candidate", but "you will not be moving forward in the process". To add insult to injury, they didn't even respond to my email requesting feedback.

It seems these homework assignments are getting very common in my field (marketing/pr), but I find it to be very predatory, especially for recent graduates like myself who have new ideas but no experience in implementing them. The reason I think this might be what they do because in the interview she let it slip that people usually do the 1 hour post interview assignment in office, meaning they've interviewed others and still haven't filled the position, and when I asked when they were looking to fill the position she hit me with the "whenever we find the right person, could be tomorrow, could be a month from now".

Should I just start refusing to do these homework assignments? Because I've had my work stolen before and it really annoys me, especially since this is the organization I had my internship with. I don't mind doing the 1 hour assignment, but the homework was sketchy. Not saying that this nonprofit will steal my ideas for sure, but let's just say I set a reminder in my phone for November...
