A single word to encompass both \"generation\" and \"annihilation\" concepts In the context of metallurgy and material science, there is a well-known process called differently but commonly \"vacancy generation/annihilation\" where a vacancy or void (or simply a tiny hole) is generated or annihilated in a piece of a material (due to some external factors such as temperature and pressure).People (are struggling to) use different phrases to describe such process in a concise and terse way. While \"vacancy generation/annihilation\" has gained more attention and support in the community, I was wondering if there exist any word to capture and encompass both \"generation\" and \"annihilation\" in one professional encapsulating place. Any advice or comment is highly appreciated.My own effort before asking: I have gone through a wide spectrum of words in various dictionaries. None of them looked thorough and accurate to me. My best pick, however, is apparition but I'm not quite sure. You can assume that I'm qualified to add a new but correct term to the community.Perhaps bad candidates:apparitionexistencepresentation (does not convey \"getting produced\")manifestationnucleationsproutsemblanceWhy bad candidates? Not feeling right to me. Correct me if they are good, indeed.
