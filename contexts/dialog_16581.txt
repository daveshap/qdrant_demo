BARNARD: Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
LOVETT: So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
BARNARD: You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
LOVETT: And be poisoned out here in the open?
BARNARD: Certainly not!
