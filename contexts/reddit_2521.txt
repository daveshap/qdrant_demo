What to do when you don't want to work?
I currently have a bachelor's degree and a stable office job, but... 

I don't wanna work. Don't wanna have a schedule.
Don't wanna create things of great use to society.
Don't want to be financially dependent on my parents also. Don't want to live on the streets. Don't wanna be an intern in a monk place. Too uncharismatic and shy to be a social influencer. Bruh
