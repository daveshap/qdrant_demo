Remote Job Startup
Question 1: Been a PC/windows user all through professional career and am now being asked if I want a Mac or pc for my new job.  Was told they don’t have a PC on hand so would have to go buy one and asked I tell them which one to get. 

I’ll be using excel 90% of my day and have always used it via a PC and windows.

Thoughts on which laptop to get vs a MacBook Pro from them?

2. So just got hired to work 100% remote. This is my first remote job - they’ll provide a laptop and said they’d pay for the internet connection.

Should they be providing me anything else or reimbursing me for things like monitors and he providing a cell phone with internet or reimburse?
