DADDY: What do you think, Brother?
BUDDY: I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
DADDY: He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son. Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
MOTHER: You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
ROSE: Yeah, it's kinda nice.
MOTHER: You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
ROSE: Well, you're real sweet to make it for me. There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
MOTHER: Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
ROSE: I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
