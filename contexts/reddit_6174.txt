Dress Code for new job [HELP]
Hello all! I start a new job at Sleep Number as a sales associate in a few weeks, to train for a few months. They didn’t give me much detail on what the dress code is and I can’t find a single piece of information online to help me find out what to wear! I would ask them but I don’t want to seem stupid. I feel like when I visited the store, they were just dressed in business casual clothing, so what would that category of clothes pertain to? And what color scheme do you think is allowed? Thank you guys for the feedback and advice in advance!
