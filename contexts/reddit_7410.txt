PhD vs Masters in Biostatistics
Hey guys!

I posted in r/statistics about this earlier, and got some really helpful replies. (Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskStatistics/comments/gl6dh8/scared_prospective_ms_student/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I’m leaning more towards a PhD program that has comparable classes to an MS, and ideally offers an MS along the way. However, I don’t know ANYTHING about how the competition is for PhD biostatistics programs. 

I’d love any advice anyone has on how to be a competitive applicant, or some insight about what I’m up against. 

Thank you for reading :):)
