I wanna try welding.
I’m 16 and have a chance to start welding in a junior college. I’m just wandering should I? Do you think that the experience would look gods on a resume. I think the school is like vocational so i don’t know. I think i would wanna go with PG&E. Just wandering if that’s the right move.
