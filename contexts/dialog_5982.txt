HOMER: Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
CANDY: You don't understand! It's her father...
HOMER: Mr. Rose *knows*?
CANDY: He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
HOMER: Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
CANDY: We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
MR. ROSE: I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
HOMER: Is it true?
