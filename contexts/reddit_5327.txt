I feel like I'm getting pushed out of my job. How necessary is a two weeks notice?
I made a couple of mistakes at work about two months ago. All of these are paper typos so not safety related but it was a hassle to fix them and it made my department look bad. Every couple of weeks I'll get a new email over those past mistakes, then there's a meeting with this person or a phone call with this other person. I get it. But at this point its overkill.

Some mistakes were my fault but others were outside of my control and my coworkers and managers are willing to shove me under the bus and push the blame onto me. For me its not worth it to argue over this or that. There's other issues at work so that's not the only thing. Additionally, I'm planning to move out state at the end of the month anyways but I haven't let them know. 

I don't mind giving them 2 weeks but I don't feel like they've handled this issue that well. Also when other people have quit, we've all gone to dinner and had speeches about their impact on the company and I'm not interested in doing that personally after all of this. In a way I feel like I'm getting fired instead of quitting on my own
