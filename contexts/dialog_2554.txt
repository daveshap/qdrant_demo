PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: Where did you get this?
MARTY: I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads... You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
MARTY: Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
