Nobody talks about the after attempt
I tried to kill myself. I overdosed heavily on a cocktail of pills and medicines. The advice i have? Don't. Nobody talks about the aftermath of when somebody saves your life. The people who know you are torn apart by grief even though you survived. And you get to see it. And you also get to see everybody talk to you as if on eggshells, treat you like you're a kicked puppy.  And the guilt is worse than that before. Because you caused that and they won't admit it to you. The guilt is soul destroying. And then there's you. Your stomach can't handle anything but water and plain bread. The sharp stabbing pains and rises of nausea that knock you off your feet. The shaking for no reason- entire body failing to function correctly at any given moment. Sleep? No. You will wake up routinely every hour or so. And that's if you can fall asleep after fighting your guilt over trying and the physical pain its caused on top of what made you try in the first place. Oh. And when you finally think your body has recovered? Its worse. You cant go out without being drained and you have literally liquid shit. Like youre peeing out of your ass. Water can even make you feel sick. 

Okay sure. You wanna die. But a lot don't succeed. And the failure is grim. I have liver damage, my stomach linings are non existent. I'm suffering more than before and i could never try again because of who i affected and the damage i've done.

Edit: it's been 3 weeks. I have to take medication for my stomach otherwise the pain is horrible and i am still just shitting and vomiting stomach acid
