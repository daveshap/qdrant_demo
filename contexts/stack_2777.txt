how is polarization distributed in a point source spherical EM wave? if we take an very small point source of EM wave, we will find that the EM wave is polarized. How does the polarization vary depending on which point of the sphere ?Polarization is always shown along one axis, but in a real 3D spherical wave it's impossible to keep a transversal EM field vector without changing its directionEDIT:My question comes from optics, if the image of a point is formed from constructive interference, then for such interference to occur, the polarization must have a specific configuration in 3D
