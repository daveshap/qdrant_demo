[Vent] I just got stood up on a home cooked dinner date and I spent $60 on ingredients.
So I was so supposed to have this dinner date with a guy. We’ve met up before and he liked that I know how to cook well. I’m not saying I’m a chef but I throw down in the kitchen. I bought fresh veggies and meat from the locals farmers market, bought all organic ingredients, and some wine out of my budget. He’s a no show. And I haven’t received a call or text for 5 hrs now. I haven’t texted him for 3 hrs. I texted once since our last full convo asking him if he was still coming. It’s past 9pm where I live. 90% of me thinks that maybe something came up, a family emergency or something and he’ll call me later. But that 10% knows I’ve been ditched. Guess I’m eating local handmade sausage and slow roasted tomato sauce over parmesan polenta with sautéed fresh zucchini and mushrooms by myself. This wine I spent $20 on better be good. I even shaved my legs and wore a cute dress.
