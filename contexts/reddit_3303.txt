Hating my master's degree. Completely lost with my career, chose the wrong university degree, how can I remedy things?
UK. 

I have had a crazy few years. I studied Psychology at University after being really passionate about it during A-Levels. I was interested in Mental Health and was motivated to become a Clinical Psychologist. I knew that I wanted to do some travelling as well so I got a job as a Support Worker with children with learning difficulties to get some Clinical Experience before travelling. 


A year later, I leave my job and travel to Australia alone. But I get into a relationship before I leave. Why? Well I'm stupid and fell in love. Anyways, so I travel and come home after 5 months and decide to start working on my career again. Every possibility goes through my head. 


I finally decide to go back to studying so I can eventually become a Clinical Psychologist hoping that through University I can become re-motivated. 


I'm now a few months into my course and I hate it. Like really hate it. It's a really good uni too. I just feel disillusioned by Clinical Psychology. It's so research based and I'm incredibly bad at stats and anything maths related. 


I've always enjoyed creative things like writing, music and art but I've always kept them as my hobbies because I know how difficult it is to make money off of them but now I'm thinking that my only chance of not being miserable the rest of my life is to pursue something like that. 


I am also really interested in languages, I've started to learn Spanish in my spare time. Also I'm 23 so I have plenty of time for a career change, I just have no clue where to go. 

Any ideas?
