International Scholarships
Good day.

I'm looking for any advice on this topic.
I'm a South African, currently living in Cambodia (teaching English).  I have a Bcom Human Resource Management degree that is internationally recognized.  I have been accepted to do my Masters in South Africa - which is an option for me.  BUT I would love to study abroad.  I have done some research on Taiwan and China(my sister and friends of mine are studying there) but I am open to any other country across the world - preferably a first world country.  

Another factor is that I'm in Cambodia with my girlfriend (she is also from South Africa and also teaching English).  She does not have a degree but is interested in obtaining one - she qualified for a Bsc degree in SA but the country is unstable and there are protests and Universities are a hazard - it's hectic!

We are both Bilingual (English and Afrikaans).  We easily adapt to new surroundings and we are looking to start/continue our studies early 2018.  We are looking for a scholarship and would love to be at the same university or the same area.

Suggestions are welcome.

Thank you,
Ruan & Kim
