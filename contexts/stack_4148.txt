Overstayed and misinformed the US consulate officer about it, am I banned for lifetime? I overstayed my J1 visa for almost 4 months in 2008. In 2017, I applied for a visa and I told them an approximate date of my return  because I couldn't remember the exact date so basically I gave them wrong information. The officer told me to apply again when I find out the correct date. I applied again 3 months ago but I couldn't get a visa. This time I didn't get any explanation from the officer. She disn\u2019t ask any questions and she just told me that I wasn\u2019t elligible for a visa this time. She gave me a paper saying that I was unable to convince them that I would return back to my country after the visit. I intend to present a paper in an academic congress in August and I will apply for a visa again soon. I know my chances are low. But I just need to know if I got a lifetime visa bar for misrepresentation or fraud? Thank you for your help.
