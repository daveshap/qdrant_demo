Most people are accepting of you having an anxiety disorder, but an unfortunate amount of people expect you to only have symptoms in private.
A stigma that I’ve noticed in the mental health community... so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences, but oh no.. don’t have a panic attack in front of them, don’t seek re-assurance from today’s anxious thoughts and jitters. 

This is something that needs changing. It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work. Even if the circumstances of the blip in their health was due to poor diet or a rough week (I had a co-worker that had this happen at work) but when I struggled with low mood I was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ 

This is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I’m lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. 

I felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you’ve been accepted or told to ‘hide’ symptoms from the public to spare THEIR discomfort... like your doing it on purpose.
