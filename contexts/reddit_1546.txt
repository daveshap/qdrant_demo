FUCK COLLEGE BOARD
This doesn't affect us seniors (thank god) but starting next year they're gonna require students to register for AP tests in the fall. For most people, if they get into an early school, they will only take the tests that that school accepts for credit, but I guess the College Board wanted to put a stop to that. They're using the excuse that it's so "students can commit to CoLLeGe-LeVeL wOrK early in the school year", but I'm pretty sure we all know the real rea$on
