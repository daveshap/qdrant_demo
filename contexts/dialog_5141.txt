KAYLEIGH: Are you okay?
EVAN: What do you mean?
KAYLEIGH: It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
EVAN: Like how?
KAYLEIGH: I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
EVAN: I walk differently?
KAYLEIGH: I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
EVAN: I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
KAYLEIGH: Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
EVAN: What?
