Advice on networking from out of state?
Hey all! I'm so glad I found this sub, it's awesome!

I just recently completed my grad program in College Student Affairs. I was debating keeping the job search local, but realized I was better off giving myself the chance to relocate and really experience something new. 

The problem I'm encountering is networking - as in I worked full-time and went to school full-time and couldn't afford the whole conference thing, so I'm wondering what is a good way to begin networking from out of state? There are definitely a few states/institutions I'm more interested in but I'm not sure how to get the ball rolling.

Any advice from other professionals, or any articles/online resources would be fantastic! Thanks!
