My family is suddenly ignoring me
I don't live near any of them and I haven't changed anything I've done. It started by asking my brother where my dad lives now (he's been jumping around a lot lately) to send him a fathers day gift. No response past "He doesn't live with me anymore."



So I facebook my dad directly, as he lives on Facebook, because ruining the surprise was better than risking him getting mad over me not acknowledging him at all on father's day. No response, marked as "seen."


Fine. I guess. Dad gets moody.


So I tell my mom about this all (divorced) and she sympathized, and I said when she takes my young brother to go see him in a week, Id just send the package with them when they pass my town along the way. Ever since that, though, she's been ignoring my messages (insurance inquiries, asking for advice, etc) on facebook, even though I saw them marked as "seen."


I don't know what I did or what's going on... I know my family and I aren't very close and I know I don't call much (and when I do, they aren't that interested or just ask if I'm pregnant), but this is just out of the blue cold shoulder... I'm 22, socially inept-ish, but I hold my own and I don't mess up. Full time employed, have my own place, generally responsible. I just don't know what to do anymore, but this is really hurting me.
