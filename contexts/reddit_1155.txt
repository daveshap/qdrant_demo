World Suicide Prevention Day | September 10th! 💚💝❤️ “... You matter! ❤️ Speak out, ... tell someone now, before it’s too late! ❤️”
This is my first time posting. ... I know this is a subreddit related only to Anxiety, but I just wanted to say, ... 

“... You have someone right here, who cares for you, and is open to talk to anyone, about anything, concerns, etc., whatever, ... I can understand, empathize and feel sympathy, and am also very supportive and friendly, so come to me please, if you ever need to talk!” ❤️ “I’m hear for you, ... any of you, and always will be!” ❤️
