I have a dance recital tomorrow & no one is coming to see me.
Sorry this is so trivial, but I'm just feeling super bummed out right now.

My family's not coming, for reasons I'd rather not go into. We've just kind of been falling out lately.

The few friends I have all happened to have other stuff going on the same night.

I've been practicing for the past five months, and now I almost feel like there's no point in performing. I'm just so disappointed that I can't share one of things I love doing most with the people I love most.

Would love some encouraging/motivating words right now. <3
