I want my work to be meaningful to me, how do I make that happen?
I have been out of work for 18 months with mental health issues. During this time I have evaluated many different aspects of my life. This includes work. I'm loosely involved in the oil and gas industry, maximising profits for the companies owners, whilst simultaneously working in an industry that's having a negative impact on the environment. Plus I don't like the work and felt very stressed there. Definitely a contributing factor to my health issues.

I want to work in a field that better aligns to my beliefs. Either helping individuals, communities or the environment. 

I've considered health, setting up additional health services, efforts towards climate change - perhaps via developing new technologies or through research on the current "mess".

Limitations: likely can't work full time, definitely can't work shifts and not sitting behind a desk all day.

Education: degree in physics, PhD in computational mathematics

Because of my mental health I have lost most of the knowledge of my degrees, although I believe my skills are still intact: problem solving, communicating data to public, researching, and Python, Matlab, VBA.

I am not fit to go back to school, but can do a few courses on Coursera or similar to shift myself across. I had been looking at establishing myself as a data scientist, but have little interest since I've been ill. 

QUESTIONS:

How do I go about drilling down into where I think I'll fit and what will work for me?

How do I perform a better diagnostic of my current skills?

Can I do this work on my own or do I need an employer?
  - How difficult is it to get skilled part time employment?

I'm sure there are many things I haven't thought to mention and several other questions I wished I had asked, but at this stage any input will be gratefully received.

Thanks
