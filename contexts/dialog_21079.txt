ANNE: No? What do you look upon her as?
STEW: Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
GALLAGHER: They all consider me just as one of the boys.
STEW: Right!
ANNE: Indeed? How interesting.
GALLAGHER: Yes - isn't it.
ANNE: Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
GALLAGHER: Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
ANNE: Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
GALLAGHER: Goodbye, Stewâ€”
STEW: That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
ANNE: I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
STEW: You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
