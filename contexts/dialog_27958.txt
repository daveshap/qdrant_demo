THELMA: Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
LOUISE: Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
THELMA: So what if he was? It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
LOUISE: Maybe.
THELMA: Well, just relax, will ya. You're makin' me nervous.
THELMA: So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
LOUISE: Givin' him a taste of his own medicine. Asshole.
THELMA: I'm sorry, Louise. I know you're all upset. It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess. I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
LOUISE: I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
THELMA: Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
LOUISE: Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
