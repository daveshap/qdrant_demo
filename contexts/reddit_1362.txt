Remember: You are strong.
I know there are times, especially on bad days, where you can feel so weak and helpless. So pathetic for not being able to beat back your anxiety, so useless for letting it win over you. Always remember that that's not true. That's a lie the disorder is telling you, it's actually the opposite of true.

You are so strong. You shoulder so much more every day than you should ever have to, and you still go on. You are always fighting. You've lived this long without giving up. You are brave for going about your day when all you want to do is crumple to the ground. You are a warrior for smiling when you want to cry. You are a champion for getting up when you just want to stay in bed all day.

I know some people might be tired of hearing things like this, but I also know there has to be at least one person who needed this reminder today. I know I needed to remind myself. You deserve a medal for the fight you're fighting. You are not weak. You are not pathetic. You are brave. You are strong.
