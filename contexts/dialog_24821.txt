SATAN: Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?! You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
SATAN: If you love somebody then you treat them with respect! You've never respected me!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Can we talk about this later? Everyone is watching!
SATAN: I don't care! I want to talk about it now!
SATAN: Ow, you're hurting me!
SADDAM HUSSEIN: Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends! You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
