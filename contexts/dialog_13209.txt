TERRI: Yeah right. How'd you get this number?
JP: Will you relax? Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
TERRI: Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here. Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station. I'm meeting lotsa new people. It's really great.
JP: Really?
TERRI: Yeah really. I'm ...
JP: No. I mean, really? Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart. I care about you. I guess I miss you. I'm sorry we split up. I'm sorry I ...
TERRI: You're apologizing?
JP: Hey, it has been known. C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy. I have regrets. I'd like to put things right. Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
TERRI: Well ... of course I have. I've thought. I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible. You really hurt me ...
JP: I know. I know. It's bad. I'm a bad person. But I try not to be, Terri. I really do. And I really miss you.
TERRI: I miss you too.
JP: That's so good to hear, sweetheart. It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
TERRI: Yes. 53
JP: Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over? You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk. Just see how we both feel?
TERRI: Oh, I don't ...
JP: C'mon. It'll be great.
