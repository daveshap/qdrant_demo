JACKIE: Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
ORDELL: Baby, I didn't --
JACKIE: It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
ORDELL: Yeah?
JACKIE: One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
ORDELL: I got a problem...
JACKIE: All your money's in Mexico.
ORDELL: Yeah.
JACKIE: I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
JACKIE: I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
ORDELL: Talk to you tomorrow.
