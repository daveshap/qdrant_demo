Does economics hold the same value as finance when applying to financial analyst jobs?
I am currently a junior majoring in economics at CSUSM but debating about switching to Finance but by doing so will set me back a year in my studies. My ultimate goal is to be a financial analyst at a bank like Wells Fargo. 

Any information or opinion is highly appreciated.
