ERIN: Hi, sweetie. Were you a good girl? Where are Matt and Katie?
MRS. MORALES: Outside with the sprinkler. So it's good?
ERIN: It'll be fine, yeah.
MRS. MORALES: Ai, bueno. Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
ERIN: What?
MRS. MORALES: My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me. I'm going to move in with her.
ERIN: You're moving away? When?
MRS. MORALES: Next week.
ERIN: Wow, that's soon --
MRS. MORALES: I know. But it's good for me. Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too. Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
