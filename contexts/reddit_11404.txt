I am under an enormous amount of stress right now. I want someone who doesn't know me and who doesn't have a biased opinion to just lend a kind ear.
Here are my first world problems that are, in fact, bothering me:

I'm a fifth year senior (at an undergraduate institution). I'm applying to law school, grad school, the peace corps, and jobs. I'm only applying to so many different things because I'm genuinely interested in all these options, and I'm not applying to more than one law school and one grad school. 

Anyways, many days I just can't manage to get anything done in terms of these long-ass, daunting applications. I don't know if subconsciously I'm intentionally putting it off, I'm just tired, or a combination of both. It's making me even more stressed because I can't manage to just get it all done.

I know this is supposed to be a process. It's not supposed to take a day or two. But, goddamnit, I miss what it felt like to just have a couple of responsibilities to worry about, instead of what feels like a thousand. 

In addition to multiple jobs and volunteering on top of my schooling, I'm also partially helping support my boyfriend through his PhD program right now, and I'm sure that adds to my stress. I love doing it because I love him, and he'd be lost without me.

I know what you're thinking--*you're complaining about the possibility of obtaining an even greater education and having a loving boyfriend? life must be tough...*--I know I'm incredibly blessed. 

You ever notice that when you are surrounded by loving people you feel even more stressed to live up to your fullest self to make those you love happy? I know, I know--these life decisions are supposed to be about me. And they are. But I still can't shake that feeling.

Thanks for listening, Reddit. Hopefully soon I'll figure at least a small part of life out.
