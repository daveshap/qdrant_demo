Currently unemployed due to COVID-19, but enjoying the pay while not having to work. Should I ride on my remaining benefits or start looking immediately?
Hey guys, so as the title states, I'm currently unemployed due to being laid off during the COVID-19 situation.

I was an IT Manager for about 4 years with years of IT experience in my background. I know in many places there have been hiring freezes and whatnot so I haven't personally began to look for new jobs knowing that right now they're seemingly non-existent.  I was laid off late March/early April and I've just enjoyed the stress-free time for the most part.

Right now on unemployment though I'm making a pretty penny while being able to take care of my daughter (we were paying about $210/week so not only am I able to be a father during these times but the money saved for not having her in daycare has amounted to a massive amount of savings -- not to mention that's one less point of exposure).

I know eventually my unemployment funds will run out, but as it currently stands that's going to be months away. I planned on using this time to get some IT certs while this all blows over but I also feel like if I stay without a job for too long it's going to be detrimental.

In your opinion, should I just start looking for work immediately or continue riding this out? I'm not going to lie, the amount of reduced stress as been amazing for my health, but I also feel like back in the older days where if I wait too long I'll have a gap in my employment that could hurt me more than anything (however, given the current circumstances in the world, I feel like I have a valid excuse for not immediately looking for work).

A few added details:

* I'm not hurting for money at the moment, got about a $12k nest egg with unemployment benefits coming in
* LinkedIn all updated with recommendations and references
* I definitely wouldn't mind investing in myself, going as far as to even starting my own little small business but for now thinking of IT certifications
* With unemployment I'm making about 20% less than what I was bringing in with my previous job but factoring in things like not having to pay daycare and a few loan deferments I'm actually breaking even until the funds run out.

EDIT: So I've already started putting in more applications, definitely. Thank you all for the advice, I'm going to try to be ahead of the mass influx of new hires.
