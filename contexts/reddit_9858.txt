Can I ask a school to fly me out to visit?
I'm looking at HIED masters, and I'd love to visit one specific school, but they're going through some budgetary changes (??) and not doing a campus visitation day. Is it out of line to email my advisor and ask if they can help to fly me out so I can at least visit before I decide? I can't afford the trip w/o some kind of assistance but idk if this is a thing?
