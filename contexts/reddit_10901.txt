I hung myself, but woke up on the floor.
I tried to hang myself with a belt two days ago.  I blacked out and woke up on the floor.  The leather around my belt buckle broke.   I don't know how long I was unconscious, but I must have hit my head and hip very hard when I fell.   I have some broken blood vessels in my left eye.  I have no one to talk to about this.  I don't know how I feel about it.   I'm not feeling any relief that it didn't work.
