I keep having nightmares about owing people large amounts of money
Last night it was about my therapist demanding $2000 before I could talk to her again. It was so real I spent a few minutes after I woke up wondering if I really did. 

This just sucks. Iâ€™m worried enough about stuff like this during my waking hours.
