The Good PI
I keep seeing stories about bad PI's and people asking advice on what to do because they wound up with a toxic PI.


I just wanted to share some light to the good PI's. So, if you have a good PI, please share why they're good, how you knew they were good/met them, and any stories about times they've been good or went above and beyond for you. 


I'll start. (I'm a MS student if that helps)


I met a PhD candidate whos research I found interesting. We discussed how I could add to it and the PI they work with. They helped me get on that PIs radar. I met with them and we were all on the same page on how I can contribute and do my own thesis.


The PI and I have weekly meetings on my progress and next steps. At first I was getting discouraged because we'd always have bits in the meetings that were along the lines of "Why did you do it this way? Thats incorrect." Or "Why is the focus on this? Try this instead." But he ALWAYS pointed me in the right direction and answered all my questions respectfully and in detail. He also listens to my ideas and has generally accepted them. Even though I do my own research for application of methods, I always learn something new in our meetings.


Now that I'm more in tune with how he does things and how the project works, the bits of meetings that discouraged me are almost nonexistent. Now he always ends the meetings with something along the lines of "This is great work Gerbaily. Great job this week. I can tell you put in a lot of work and we are progressing quickly. Keep it up." He's awesome and I always feel proud after our meetings. It keeps me motivated to continuously do work and do just a *little* more before our next meeting. I'd hate to let him down!


And thats my story of my awesome PI. What's yours?
