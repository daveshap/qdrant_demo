JOE: What's she doin' now?
MR. WHITE: She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
JOE: Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
MR. WHITE: Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
JOE: Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
MR. WHITE: He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
JOE: What for?
MR. WHITE: Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
JOE: Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
MR. WHITE: How many employees?
JOE: Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
MR. WHITE: No, they're not.
MR. WHITE: What's the cut, poppa?
JOE: Juicy, junior, real juicy.
