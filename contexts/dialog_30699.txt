HEATHER: Maybe. Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
CHASE: You've got to get back on the horse some time. Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls. I know how scary that feels.
HEATHER: No, you don't.
CHASE: Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
HEATHER: What if it isn't over?
CHASE: Maybe you should tell me your dream.
HEATHER: It was nothing. We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong. Terry and Chuck were...hurt. You were almost... You were even cut.
CHASE: You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass. Dreams work like that. You want me not to go on this job?
HEATHER: Just be careful, okay?
CHASE: I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
HEATHER: Guess so.
CHASE: 48 hours. Back before you know it.
