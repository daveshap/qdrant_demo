I don't like talking to people
I love listening to people though; most of the time, when i talk to people, i end up just nodding my head and going "mhmm" and "uhuh", not because I'm not interested in the conversation (I'm usually pretty engrossed) but because it sometimes just doesn't trigger in my brain that, in order to listen more, i have to say something. it didn't really bother me until a close friend stated that it wasn't fun talking to me because it feels like he's talking to a wall. I don't really know what to do about it though.
