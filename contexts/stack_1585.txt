Do standard 3.5mm plugs short the terminals when plugging or unplugging? I need an inexpensive connector to deliver positive, negative, and signal. I was considering using a standard 3.5mm audio style plug. However, I am concerned that when plugging in the connector, it could possibly short tip to sleeve for example, just from looking at how the jacks are usually constructed.Is this true? Is there a better connector style to use then, something \"hot swappable\"?
