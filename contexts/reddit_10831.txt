Those cheesy suicide prevention poems
Go onto any YouTube video, or anything that is related to suicide, and you’ll get people who say something along the lines of this chessy ass Tumblr shit.

“Your skin isn’t paper, don’t cut it. Your life isn’t a film, don’t end it. Your face isn’t a mask, don’t hide it. Your size isn’t a book, don’t judge it. Don’t kill yourself, people out there care about you.”

Fuck off, we all know whoever came up with this quote don’t even know what depression is like and just made it up on Tumblr to get likes. If you did know what depression is like, you wouldn’t say that cheesy Hollywood bullshit. It’s sad too, because I saw a video of a kid who committed suicide, and the whole comment section was copied-and-pasted-filled with the same exact verse. If I was the kid who killed himself, and I was still alive somehow, I’d feel disrespected as fuck that all of these people are pretending to feel bad for me and sharing those cheesy ass rhymes. Bullshit.
