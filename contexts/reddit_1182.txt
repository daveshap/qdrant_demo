I get anxiety from posting/commenting on Reddit.
This sounds so silly, but can anyone relate? I want to contribute to conversations/post things but I worry about downvotes. How STUPID is that? It shouldn’t matter. But here I am, worrying that this post will embarrass me. And if I do post or comment, I seriously worry about it and if I look stupid. Like I’m a complete stranger to everyone anyway. Please tell me I’m not a total freak. The only time I can comfortably post is if I’m drunk and that results in me usually deleting them. And I shouldn’t drink anyway. I just wanted to get that off my chest.

EDIT: I should probably add that I’ve been drinking and that’s why I had the courage to post this because I’m a fucking coward.

EDIT #2: I found out this same issue was posted recently. Sorry!
