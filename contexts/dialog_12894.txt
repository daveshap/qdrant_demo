MAC: She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
GRACE: Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
MAC: It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
GRACE: You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking. And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
MAC: Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't.
GRACE: He could always make me laugh.
MAC: We did the decent thing.
GRACE: This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
MAC: We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
GRACE: We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
