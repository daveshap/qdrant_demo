How to split up voltages I want to power up bluetooth receiver module (input voltage 3.7) and audio amplifier module which accepts only 2.4 - 3.7 voltage, exceeding which already burnt the IC. So i got new one. I'm having 2 x 4300mAh 18650 battery which gives 3.7 voltage each. When i connected both batteries in series and connected both modules in series, (i thought the voltage will split up, but as i already mentioned, it burnt the amplifier(PAM8403) IC). Since i'm very new to electronics, i somehow figured out resistor (V=IR) will do the job but i don't know how to calculate the required resistance.
