I visited 100+ top colleges, 360° campus tour videos of each are on Youtube
Three years ago I began visiting colleges with a 360 camera so my students could see the campus without having to fly there. Now these videos are all on Youtube so you can visit them without leaving home!

**In each video, there are some stats by "looking down":**

\- USNews undergrad rank from 2010 - 2015 - 2020

\- Full undergrad cost of attendance. I couldn't find this info aggregated anywhere so I went to every school's website and added tuition+room+board+fees+insurance, basically everything you need to budget for 1 school year.

\- Average undergrad starting salary from Payscale.com

\- SAT ranges (new 1600 SAT)

\- Undergrad early and regular deadlines

\- Nearest major city and relevant stats

&#x200B;

**When walking/driving outside of buildings:**

\- Each video also has at least 10 fun facts that I felt really define that school. I hand picked these after reading from Fiske's Guide, Princeton Review guide, reviews from students at [unigo.com](https://unigo.com/), and online about the colleges. After reading hundreds of comments about each college, you end up with a "feel" for what's unique and what's the same everywhere.

&#x200B;

**For more immersive playback**

1. Youtube defaults to 720p – 1080p playback, which is too low for 360° video. Click the settings icon and change to 4k for MUCH better quality.
2. Playback on your phone/ipad tends to be much smoother than playback on PC (unless your PC has dedicated graphics card)
3. For wider field of view, play back on your computer in full screen mode (F11) and scroll down on your mouse. You’ll get about 1-2 notches on your scroll wheel before the page itself starts to scroll down. This is the widest field of view, press Page Up to go back up to the top of the video and enjoy the wider field of view!
