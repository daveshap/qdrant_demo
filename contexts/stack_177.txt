Extract wallpapers from macOS installation CDs or disk images without installation Is there a way to extract wallpapers from macOS installation CD without performing installation itself?Yes, I understand 7zip can unzip dmg file as a simple archive. But what next? I don't see any wallpapers after unzipping.My ultimate aim is to get the original unaltered desktop background pictures included with Mac OS X versions 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9.
