DR. PAYSON: Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
MALCOLM: Please, go ahead.
DR. PAYSON: Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
MALCOLM: For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate."
