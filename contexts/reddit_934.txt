Does anyone else get this sense of "dread" everytime you're home because you gotta go back to work the next day?
I always get this dreaded feeling everytime i am home. At work i feel fine, no anxiety but everytime i come home i get anxiety about the next day.

Even if it's friday i start dreading monday. I don't even dislike my job that much but i think it may have to do with very bad job experiences with not so nice employers/colleagues.

Anyone else get this feeling? I am diagnosed with Unspecified phobic anxiety mild to moderate.
