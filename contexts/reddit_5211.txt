Have you ever responded to a rejection email?
Has anything good ever come out of responding to a rejection email? I've heard of someone being later hired for a different position after being rejected for one, but I can't find the post.

I've only responded to one that said they liked my experience and might consider me for a different and more suitable position, since the original position turned out to be different than my goals.
