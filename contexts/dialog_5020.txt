BUFFY: Oh, what the hell is wrong with you? You threw a knife at my head!
MERRICK: I had to test you.
BUFFY: But you threw a knife at my head!
MERRICK: And you caught it! Only the chosen one could have done that.
BUFFY: I don't want to be the chosen one, okay? I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires! I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die. It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell. And then you come along... and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
MERRICK: It was necessary.
BUFFY: Last night. You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?
MERRICK: I don't think you understand the full implications of --
BUFFY: Oh. Sorry.
MERRICK: Don't you see what's happening? You're changing. You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of. God, this hurts. I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working. I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
BUFFY: Put your head back.
MERRICK: Two days ago, would you have even hit me? Let alone so powerfully?
BUFFY: No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
MERRICK: Exactly. You're changing. You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
BUFFY: Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
MERRICK: Your turn.
BUFFY: What about bats? Do they turn into bats?
MERRICK: No. No bats, no flying. They... float, occasionally. Not really flying.
BUFFY: Toasty. Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
MERRICK: Oh, several. Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
BUFFY: If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
MERRICK: Good Lord. What do you study in history?
BUFFY: My nails.
MERRICK: All right. You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps? Or Jack the Ripper?
BUFFY: They were vampires?
MERRICK: Same one.
BUFFY: Oh.
