SALLY: I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre. I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
YOUNG WASHINGTON: I'm lost in ecstasy! And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
SALLY: And dost thou live to ask it?
WILLIAM: My daughter, I ask only...
YOUNG WASHINGTON: This, this is life indeed! Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
