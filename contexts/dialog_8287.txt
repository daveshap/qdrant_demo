THE PATIENT: Hana tells me you're leaving.
CARAVAGGIO: There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
THE PATIENT: We shall miss you.
CARAVAGGIO: So, I come across the Hospital Convoy I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat - how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession - - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
THE PATIENT: Me?
CARAVAGGIO: I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
THE PATIENT: I see.
CARAVAGGIO: Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
THE PATIENT: And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
CARAVAGGIO: You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
THE PATIENT: I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise. The rest meant nothing to me.
CARAVAGGIO: What did you say?
THE PATIENT: The rest meant nothing to me.
CARAVAGGIO: There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition. It did this. If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
THE PATIENT: Thousands of people did die, just different people.
CARAVAGGIO: But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
THE PATIENT: Is that what you thought? That I betrayed the British? The British betrayed me. The British betrayed me.
ALMÁSY: Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
KATHARINE: I can't move. I can't get out.
ALMÁSY: Why did he bring you?
KATHARINE: A surprise, he said.
