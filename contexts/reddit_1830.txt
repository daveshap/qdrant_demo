Our school’s #1 rank is a major cheater
Basically the title. It’s common knowledge in my school that our first ranked student is a major cheater. It seems as if she has a lot of luck because (1) she plagiarized her whole English paper, got caught by the teacher, but never got in trouble (weird cause usually when you plagiarize, teachers say they’ll put it on your transcript). (2) For all her AP classes, she cheated on tests and quizzes through the papers given to her by her upperclassman friends and when students report her, the teachers are all like “____ is a good student. She would never cheat.” 
It puts things into perspective about success, school, and cheating🙃
