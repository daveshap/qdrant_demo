Word or phrase for fake appearance or posturing I'm looking for a noun (it has to be an object) that expresses the concept of fake appearances.  In Spanish, we can express that with the word \"facade\" understood as the front of a wall (but part of a building) because a beautiful facade can hide horrible things inside of the building (things that we don't discover until we enter). The cover (of a book) can express that concept as well.To be more specific, I'll give you some examples in Spanish:Era todo fachada. (It was all facade).Cuidado con las fachadas bonitas. (Beware of beautiful facades).The concept that I'm looking for is usually used to express deception after realize that you were wrong about someone. I'd like to emphasize that I'm not looking for an adjective or abstract word (or expression) but for a physical object.Is there any word in English to express that?
