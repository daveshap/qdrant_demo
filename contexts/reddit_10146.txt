I am never "suicidal enough" to be heard. I am too well-dressed, too articulate, too friendly "too" everything to be worthy of any support.
And I am gradually withering away because of it.

Mental health professionals never take me seriously. I can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes, their disengaged body language, their patronising tone of voice. They say I'm "too" well-dressed, "too" articulate, "too" intelligent. I am "too" kind, I smile "too" often, I'm "too" calm.

This has not only been offensive to me, but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal. Their implication that suicidal people are dumb, frenzied and rude slobs was - and still is - fucking preposterous.

I have tried to get help for approximately 8 years. I have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears. But unless I'm trying to end my life right now in front of them, it doesn't matter. None of it matters. I don't matter. 

My public face is "too" convincing. But this was carefully created and crafted, over many years, because I had no choice. I had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain I have suffered behind a smile. I was never given an alternative, and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this fa√ßade, they did nothing.

The truth is, a part of me is frightened of dying, and my survival instincts kick in when I don't want them to. But that doesn't mean I want to live, either. If I could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it, I would. 

Why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care? Why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to? Why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out? I hate this. I hate my life. I hate myself. Let me be what they want me to be, please.

**EDIT:** I never ever _ever_ consider others as "dumb, frenzied, rude slobs" by the way. I'm so sorry if I made anyone feel that way. It's simply how I interpret the reaction of mental health professionals, when they say "But you're so clever/hygienic/pretty/well-groomed" etc. It feels like a slap in the face, as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented, and looked down on if they are not, too (but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view).
If someone is unkempt, hasn't showered, is visibly distressed or less coherent, I do NOT judge them or advocate doing so. _But using someone's appearance as a way of invalidating their pain? That's **completely** wrong._


**EDIT 2:** Thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject. It means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people, it also brings me comfort. I am sorry for not responding to everyone yet. If you have had a similarly invalidating experience, I am so sorry. I appreciate the difficulty internalising this, but it is _not_ your fault. You are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional, who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments.


In positive developments, the crisis team visited me at home this evening. Both mental health nurses listened to me, emphasised that the way I was treated for the last 8 years was unacceptable, completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy. It has restored a little bit of faith in the NHS. They are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that I be allocated a Care Co-ordinator, who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections. I have not allowed myself to anticipate too much, but I cried with relief after they left. I hope they keep their word. I hope they meant it. I desperately just hope. Until I receive an outcome, I will sincerely try to stay alive. I am not in a position to promise that I will survive, but I can promise that I will try, one more time.
