Why all laser photons are in the same direction? The lasing process begins when just one photon is accidently emitted. This explains why the photons on the line between the two mirrors are in phase. But what about the neighboring atoms or even distant one not on that line. How are they excited by that initial photon (by its wavefunction? WF) and why will they go perpendicularly to the mirrors. I expect they will go radially because the WF is spherical. And how does a plane wave build? The Huygens principle says that a spherical wave builds also spherical wave.
