JACK BANGS: I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
YOUNG GOVERNOR: Mr. Bangs.
JACK BANGS: Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
YOUNG GOVERNOR: The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
JACK BANGS: I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
YOUNG GOVERNOR: We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
