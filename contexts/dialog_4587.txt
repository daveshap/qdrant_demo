CAESAR: I got it! I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.
VIOLET: The money? The money's gone.
CAESAR: No. Johnnie's got it. All I got to do is get it back.
VIOLET: But it could be anywhere.
CAESAR: He didn't have that much time. He had to pick up Gino. I bet you he's got it with him. I bet it's in the car.
CAESAR: He didn't see you, did he?
VIOLET: No.
CAESAR: See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case. He wants me to hand the case to Gino. Then there is no doubt it was me. Gino will put a bullet in me himself. But it ain't going to happen. I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me! Not like this! No way!
VIOLET: This is insane!
