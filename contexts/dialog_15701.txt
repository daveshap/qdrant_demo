CRAWFORD: I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
CLARICE: It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
CRAWFORD: Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
CLARICE: Right down to the kleenex I used. Sir, why? Is something wrong?
CRAWFORD: He mentioned a name, at the very end. Mofet..." Any followup on her?"
CLARICE: I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages. It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore
CRAWFORD: Well? Why aren't you there right now?
CLARICE: Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
CRAWFORD: Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
CLARICE: To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
CRAWFORD: Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
CLARICE: Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
CRAWFORD: Miggs has been murdered.
CLARICE: Murdered...? How?
CRAWFORD: The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless. Starling...?
CLARICE: I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
CRAWFORD: You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello... I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
