The girl I'm into and my gay best friend have a more sexual relationship that I've had with anyone in years.
So I had some friends over this weekend. My gay best friend (we'll call him Steve) was there, with his boyfriend (his name will be Joe) , the girl I'm into (her name can be Anna) and a whole bunch of other people. I've known Anna for a decade and Steve for nearly 2.

I love that all of my friends seem to hit it off when I introduce them, and none so much as Steve and Anna. They're friendship gets a bit silly once alcohol is involved, though. They fake flirt with each other (she knows he's gay, and he is definitely not interested in women) and this escalated quite a lot in the past few weeks.

Steve knows that I'm into Anna, and that I've just not thought of the best way to tell her. I don't want to impose something on the friendship if there's nothing there, and she told me a few weeks ago "I don't want to bother with relationships at the minute. Maybe in a year or so, though."

I'm normally a pretty chill guy, if I do say so about folks not being into me (I've had more rejections than I care to remember). But I've no idea why this situation has affected me so much:

So we're all sat drinking, laughing and having a good time. When Steve walks past Anna and grabs both her boobs. She let's out a little surprise yelp, followed by some appreciative noises. He laughs, let's go and walks away. He's gay, so she thinks nothing of it, and he did it for the laugh. Joe didn't seem to care for the same reason. Steve made a point of walking over to me afterward and saying, quite loudly, "jealous?". Then he laughed and walked away.

I've been obsessing over this for days, and I can't seem to get over it. Is it entirely possible that I'm jealous of Steve? Probably. 

I'm being pretty pathetic about this, I'm sure. And I guess that I should just man up and tell Anna that I'm into her, but (given my track record) she'll probably make some remark about us being great friends and how that would change everything. I'm not into arguing the case for someone dating me (I'm not going to try and make someone do something that they don't want to do), so I'll probably not bother to try and convince her otherwise.

I wasn't like this when she was with her last boyfriend. I guess it's because Steve knows that I'm into her. Hell, she probably does too now - not just on Steve's post grope remark either; he's a bit of a chatterer when he drinks.

**edit**: a lot of you good folks are saying just to tell her, but no place any pressure on her. I'm interested in doing this, I really am. Were it not for the fact that I'm moving 60 miles away in a few weeks.

**edit 2**: because I'd forgotten to mention it before: I share a house with my gay friend, and I've been off with him since the "event". Now that I've had a few days to think on it (and some excellent advice form the folks here), I feel childish and stupid for reacting the way that I have.

**edit 3**: I told her. She said, "I don't see you as the other half type." at least I know.

**Edit 4**: I'm having out with Anna and Steve again (I know, I know. I'm making things worse for myself). "I'd love to come home from work and fuck him every night," is what she just said about Steve. Lovely. Anyway, time to put this story to bed.
