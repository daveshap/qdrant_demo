MURPHY: With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
DODGE: Sounds reasonable.
GREER: Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
DODGE: They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
GREER: I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
MURPHY: The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
EPPS: They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
DODGE: Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
EPPS: Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
