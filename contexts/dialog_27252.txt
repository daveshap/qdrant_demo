MULDER: We're going to the morgue.
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD: That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
MULDER: On whose orders?
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD: General McAddie's.
MULDER: General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD: I don't know anything about that.
MULDER: Well, call General McAddie.
YOUNG NAVAL GUARD: I don't have his number.
MULDER: They can patch you in through the switchboard.
