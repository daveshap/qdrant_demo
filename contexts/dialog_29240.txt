LINDA: You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
BABE BROTHER: Will you still get the money from your father?
LINDA: I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
BABE BROTHER: Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
LINDA: We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
BABE BROTHER: I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
JUNIOR: You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
BABE BROTHER: Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
JUNIOR: This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
BABE BROTHER: This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
JUNIOR: Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
BABE BROTHER: Maybe I can get down there next week.
