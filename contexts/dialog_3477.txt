NORTHER WINSLOW: It's me. Norther Winslow.
EDWARD: I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
EDWARD: I don't believe it!
NORTHER WINSLOW: I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
EDWARD: That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
EDWARD: So what are you up to now?
NORTHER WINSLOW: I'm robbing this place.
