DANIEL: You know Dmitri?
VINCENT: 'Fraid so.
DANIEL: And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
VINCENT: I am a nice guy, Daniel. With a job to do. You know how it is.
MAX: Let him go, Vincent.
VINCENT: You mind? I'm working here.
MAX: You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow. You like the man, you like the way he plays. How about a little jazz, huh?
VINCENT: Jazz? That's funny, coming from you. Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this? I'll ask a question.
DANIEL: What kind of question?
VINCENT: Jazz question. What other kind is there? You get it right, we roll with it. You disappear. Tonight. You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
DANIEL: How do I know you'll keep your word?
VINCENT: I never lie. Ask Max. Max, have I lied yet?
