Dear schools,
Stop punishing students for being involved in fights if it was self defense. Stop trying to say, iF sOmEOne iS HurTing YoU teLl a teaCheR. It’s a little fucking hard to do that if it’s the first time happening and your on the ground getting kicked in the fucking stomach

Edit: for everyone saying why am I saying this in quarantine, I’ve wanted say this for a while but I only recently discovered r/teenagers. Oh and also to the ones complaining about how this isn’t an original post, that should show you how little school cares people say it, social media says it,everyone says it but schools don’t give a shit.
Also downvote if you don’t like it not being original I don’t give a fuck but the fact that thousands of people say it and there still no change says a lot
