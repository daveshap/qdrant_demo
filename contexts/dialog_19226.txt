DUFF: Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
JOSIE: You will.
DUFF: Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
JOSIE: They won't.
DUFF: I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
JOSIE: We can always do that, Duff.
DUFF: Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
