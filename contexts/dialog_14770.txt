HELENA: When did John divorce?
MARGIE: Two or three years ago.
HELENA: What was she like?
MARGIE: Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
HELENA: What does that mean?
MARGIE: You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
HELENA: You think he still loves her?
MARGIE: Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
HELENA: I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
MARGIE: Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
HELENA: You think John would like it?
MARGIE: I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
