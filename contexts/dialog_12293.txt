VERONICA: First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
J.D.: Incredible similarity.
VERONICA: Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
J.D.: Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
VERONICA: We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
J.D.: They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
VERONICA: Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
J.D.: It doesn't work on small animals!
VERONICA: Oh.
J.D.: Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
J.D.: We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
VERONICA: You must have had fun.
J.D.: You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up...
J.D.: Perrier water!
VERONICA: Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
J.D.: This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
VERONICA: Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
RAM: Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
KURT: Shut the fuck up, all right.
RAM: Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
