Is possible to attack a Wordpress website if someone know username and password of admin account? Currently, I prevented accessing my wp-admin by htaccess as well as used functions.php to create a function to prevent accessing admin panel if the user is Admin.If someone knows the username and password of the Admin account, is it possible to change my website appearance as well as deleting posts/comments, etc.?If possible, how could they?
