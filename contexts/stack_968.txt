Boot Failure for Ubuntu 18.04 Install on Thinkpad P1 I have a new Lenovo Thinkpad P1 with i7-8850/32GB mem/1TB SSD/P2000 graphicsThe laptop came with Windows installed out of the box and I want to dual boot ubuntu along side.Using Rufus 3.3 I placed a bootable ubuntu 18.04 image on a USB drive. As I understand, Ubuntu 18.04 is UEFI compatible (and supposedly Secure Boot compatible but that seems controversial).I turn on the computer, F12 to the Boot Menu, select my USB (which takes me to GRUB), select \"Install Ubuntu\".Now this is where the problem starts, upon selecting install ubuntu, I am taken to an Ubuntu loading screen (purple background, ubuntu name with dots underneath changing between white and orange) after about 5-15 seconds (very roughly) the computer powers off....I've tried various combinations of SecureBoot/BootMode/UEFI/etc. settings to no avail in the BIOS.Help is greatly appreciated!
