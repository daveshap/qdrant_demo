LED driver type detection- 0-10V or DALI I am looking for the solution which can automatically detect the driver type installed in street light luminary.There are control mechanism which controls and provides the 0-10V and DALI dimming to driver installed in luminary.Now what I want is I to develop mechanism that automatically detect the driver type (DALI/ 0-10V) and provide the dimming interface accordingly. There is 2 wire interface between control mechanism and driver.0-10V is analog type dimming and DALI is digital interface. How it can be done Any idea.
