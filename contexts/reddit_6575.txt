Payroll card.
Sorry if this is a r/lostredditor moment I'm not sure where else to post this. I got a job at Jamba juice yadda yadda yadda. Anywhale, they use payroll cards. I know these work like debit cards except aren't connected to a bank account.

I heard there's a lot of fees. How do I avoid getting specific fees. 

Furthermore, I was wondering if I'd be able to deposit money from the card into my savings account somehow. I tried looking all this up but I couldn't get a clear answer. Thank you.
