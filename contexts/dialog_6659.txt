SAMI: How'd it go? I don't know. Daniel, how would you say it went?
DANIEL: I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
SOPHIE: No, I didn't.
JULIEN: Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
SOPHIE: Yes.
JULIEN: And he gave it to us. 145 Ridgeway Road.
SOPHIE: No. 145 Ridgeroad Way.
DANIEL: That moron.
MARCEL: It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
DANIEL: Everyone get some sleep. We're leaving in the morning.
