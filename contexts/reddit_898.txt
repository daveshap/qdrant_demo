UPDATE: Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.
As the original post got quite a lot of attraction I'll post an update.

Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to "guarantee" success. 

Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.

I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.

I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about " having some upper respetory symptoms " or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.

Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.

I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.

This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says " You do everything you can, and that's all you can do ". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. 

And what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work. Fml.
