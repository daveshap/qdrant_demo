THEO: You told Junior that we did it.
SHEILA: It?
THEO: It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
SHEILA: I told him you were my boyfriend.
THEO: What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
SHEILA: We would have sooner or later.
THEO: Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
SHEILA: Did you - kill him?
THEO: How do you get this thing down?
SHEILA: Tell me what happened Theo.
THEO: You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
SHEILA: If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
THEO: He's dead Sheila.
SHEILA: I feel sick.
THEO: You should.
SHEILA: Are you sure he's dead?
THEO: I didn't stop to take his pulse.
SHEILA: Where are you going?
THEO: I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
SHEILA: Can I come with you?
THEO: I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
