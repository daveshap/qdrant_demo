Considering a career change into academic advising/career counseling
Hi All! I just needed some words of advice on the field of student affairs, specifically academic advising and/or career counseling. Some background on me- I am a business marketing and management graduate and have been working in the HR field for about 4 years now. Essentially, these 4 years in the workforce have been very trial and error, but I finally have discovered my real strengths and passions. I can not see myself making a career in HR and wanting to grow myself further in that. As a result, for about a year or more now, I have been very drawn to student affairs as it aligns my strengths and passions. I will save you all that fluff and just simply ask the following questions. Answers to really any of these would be helpful to me! 

1. What advice would anyone have for trying breaking into this field? I realize this may require me to obtain a masters degree, especially having no experience in the field although I believe there are plenty of skillsets that I can apply from my HR/recruiting background. 
2. Are job prospects good for entry level grads from student affairs programs? 
3. Would academic advising be a job I could obtain right away with this degree, or would I have to work up to it?
4. Academic advising versus career counseling (at the college level). Any insight into the differences on the 2 and what may be better to go into?
