Admitted to myself today thay I need help
Tried searching for a therapist online today but couldn't find anything locally and broke down. I have been struggling with depression my whole life but always set my feelings aside for the sake of my family... or self medicated with alcohol and weed. 

I recently found out that I am pregnant and stopped smoking cigs, weed and drinking... I live 2 hours away from my family and I just feel so hopeless... My significant other has been great with everything since we found out about the baby, doing everything around the house, feeding me... I can't find joy in anything anymore and I don't know what to do... I can't even get out of bed or off the couch unless it's for work. 

I have my first appointment with my OB tomorrow so I plan on talking with her about how I feel as long as I don't chicken out... 

I guess I just needed to get this all off my chest to someone who wasn't going to judge me.  It felt good just typing this out as I have never admitted this to myself seriously before. Thank you for listening.

Update: 
Thank you all for your kindness, advice and support. I almost deleted my post after I typed it, but I am so relieved that I didn't. I have a habit of hiding my feelings, so it was difficult to even share this about myself anonymously. Your support and validation gives me hope â™¡.
