Everyone hates me and I’m tired of it
I’m tired of everyone hating me and treating me badly. I didn’t do anything bad to make everyone hate me. No one wants me. No one has ever wanted to be my friend irl, no one wants to be my girlfriend, no one wants to have anything to do with me. Everyone just leaves me, even when they say they wont. The best “friend” I ever had left me almost 2 months ago. Everyone just leaves, rejects, and makes fun of me. I don’t get why. There’s just no point in me living.
