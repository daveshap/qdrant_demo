GALVIN: Uh ...
MICKEY: Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
GALVIN: ... now who is that ...?
MICKEY: ... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...
GALVIN: Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
MICKEY: One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
GALVIN: ... hey, I don't need your charity ...
MICKEY: ... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
