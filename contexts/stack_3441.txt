Is securing Apache with SSL certificates enough to protect all of the underlying applications? I have a few applications that serve HTTP content on localhost.I have installed apache and configured reverse proxy so that apache routes all the traffic to the underlying applications based on URL patterns.Then I ran cert-bot and installed an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.Only apache knows about SSL and HTTPS.Is this secure? Am I doing anything wrong?Is it more secure if my applications handle SSL or can I let apache take care of it?I know that anyone inside my server can bypass SSL of course. I dont consider that a problem.
