DON CORLEONE: My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight. So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
HAGEN: I didn't tell Mama anything. I was about to come up and wake you and tell you. Just now.
DON CORLEONE: But you needed a drink first.
HAGEN: Yes.
DON CORLEONE: Now you've had your drink.
