Cross-Installing Programs The computer I am setting up has three partitions. One for windows10, one for linux, and one for files and programs shared between them. Is there a way to install programs on the third partition (like python, pycharm, matlab, etc.) to work on both OSes or do I have to install on each OS there own version of python, c++, etc? Is the third partition limited to sharing files or can it be used to share IDEs, applications, compilers, and interpreters?Thank you so much
