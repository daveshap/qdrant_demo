MS. HELLER: So what do you keep in there?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
MS. HELLER: Everything?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Everything. Just for the record.
MS. HELLER: Oh, just like the President.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Just like the President.
HARRY: LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
LLOYD: Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
HARRY: ...cause you said...
LLOYD: HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
HARRY: Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
LLOYD: HARRY! Here he comes.
CALE: Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
HARRY: Actually we have something for you.
