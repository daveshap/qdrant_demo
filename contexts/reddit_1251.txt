Does anyone else get really bad anxiety when it comes to talking on the phone?
I have trouble making calls or even answering the phone for important conversations. I canâ€™t rationalize it at all, but every time my phone rings I just get this terrible knot in my stomach and let it go to voicemail to avoid the conversation. Does anyone else experience anything similar? If so, do you have any tips for how to deal with this?
