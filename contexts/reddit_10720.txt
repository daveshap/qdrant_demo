Ever cried so quietly that the people sitting next to you don't notice?
Sometimes tears start falling down my face because I just can't stop them. I have so much pain inside me that it come out randomly when I least want it to. 

I was sitting in the living room with my family and I started crying over something my friend said in jest. I just sat there while my "family" went on with whatever they were doing. They don't give a Fuck about me. I feel constantly ignored, invalidated, pushed away, silenced and neglected. Nothing I say is taken seriously. My feelings are cast aside. I've stopped trying to make them see how hurt I am. Their just too blind. No one cares about me.

If I die, No one will care, so why not do it? Not like there's anyone stopping me. I have access to knives, ropes, ladders, a body of water and strong medicine. I have options on how I want to die.

No one will miss me. No point in stating in this fucking dimension.
