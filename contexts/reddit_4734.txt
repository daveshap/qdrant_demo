I'm so afraid that I've messed everything up already
... And that I can no longer make something of myself anymore. For a little background, I'm a man in my early 20's living in a country where a diploma pretty much makes or breaks your future. From a very young age I was already pegged for success and things were going well but the problem was that as I grew older I just became more and more depressed. 2 1/2 years into a pre-med course, I met some like-minded individuals who also weren't happy and we decided to fuck everything up. A failed suicide attempt and a whole semester out of school later I went back to uni now in an English course which screwed me over after 1 1/2 semester as they changed the curriculum and required me to go back to freshman year. I lost the courage and the patience. I've been out of school for a whole year now and I've been faking it to the people I know by editing my grades on the internet. Now I've fallen out of touch with my parents because I've disappointed them too much and I'm stuck in a joyless career which is neither meaningful or helping me grow. I also have a girlfriend who means the world to me who's older and is taking her Doctorate. She's expecting me to finish anytime soon, get a real career and finally settle down. I feel like everyone's expecting something from me that I can't deliver. I've done fucked up so much that I don't even know where to begin fixing things. Honestly, I don't even know what has kept me going. Back in late 2018 I attempted suicide. Before 2019 ended I promised that I won't reach the New Year. But oddly enough I'm still here but I'm afraid I might finally burnout. I haven't sought help since my attempt since it was the meds that I tried to do it with. I just wish my future didn't revolve around a piece of paper so much or at the very least I wish I was able to do things right the very first time around.
