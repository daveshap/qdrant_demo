Is character customisation any different from on the Wii U and 3ds versions? I've watched a bit of Super Smash Bros Ultimate gameplay and wanted to ask a bit about the game. I feel one of the most important parts of the Wii U and 3ds versions was the ability to challenge people using the customizations that you worked hard to get the equipment and specials for. I want to find out if the customization feature is any different from the 3ds and Wii U games, and check there is no way that it has been downgraded.I've seen that the game offers a mode called world of light, in which you can gain spirits that give you stats and abilities. Can these spirits be used in multiplayer?The game seems to be amibo compatible, but I don't know if their functionality is the same or not. Are amibo that are setup for the previous two smash games compatible and is their functionality any different?Thanks for any help.
