Why do I get "text back" anxiety?
Rationally, I KNOW that people are busy living their lives. But WHY do I get the horrible anxious feeling whenever my boyfriend goes a whole day without calling or texting me?

He is a busy man, and I know that he gets tired after a long work day. I'm not a naggy girlfriend either, but my dumb brain goes into overdrive always thinking about silly scenarios of why he's not answering me.

"He doesn't like you anymore"
"You're not important enough"
"He forgot about you again today, maybe another girl is distracting him"

In reality, he probably just fell asleep.
"But he always says goodnight first" ...urgh!!

Please tell me I'm not the only one! Help!

EDIT: Thank you ALL who have responded. It truly means a lot to me to know that I'm not totally insane or alone! I agree that there are many factors involved, it's not 100% me. Although I feel like I need some distraction strategies to help me with the overthinking :/
