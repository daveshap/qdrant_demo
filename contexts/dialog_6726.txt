LO: Your father's men are still looking for you. They're still out there, circling closer.
JEN: Let them look.
LO: It is trouble for me.
JEN: Don't send me back!
LO: You must decide. You might get tired of this life. You might begin to miss your family. If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too. She would miss us. Jen... I want you to be mine forever. I will make my mark on the world. I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend. Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish. Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped. He didn't die. He wasn't even hurt. He floated away, far away, never to return. He knew his wish had come true. If you believe, it will happen. The elders say, A faithful heart makes wishes come true.""
JEN: Keep it safe. Return it to me when we are together again.
LO: I will.
JEN: If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
