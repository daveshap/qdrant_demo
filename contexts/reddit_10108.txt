Capstone on Athletics. Help?
I am beginning my capstone for my Master's in Higher Education soon and am asking for help with sources/topics. I am very interested in collegiate athletics and academics, such as how student athletes develop identities outside their sports, especially at smaller schools. I went to a regional DI school (5000 students) for undergrad and am now at a larger, research institution for grad school (25,000 students). Any ideas on how I could narrow this focus or sources to consider?
