NICKY: Motherfucker. Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
ACE: Nope, there's no way.
NICKY: Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
ACE: Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
NICKY: In other words, I'm fucked.
ACE: In so many words, yes.
ACE: It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
NICKY: I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
