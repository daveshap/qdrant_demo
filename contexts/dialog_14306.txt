MELANIE: Which one?
LOUIS: The roller disco one.
MELANIE: Fourteen.
LOUIS: You're fourteen years old here?
MELANIE: Yeah.
LOUIS: I thought you were sixteen.
MELANIE: I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
LOUIS: Were you a disco girl?
MELANIE: Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
LOUIS: So where did you go?
MELANIE: The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
MELANIE: That was taken at a place called Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?"
LOUIS: No.
MELANIE: Where were you?
LOUIS: Detroit.
MELANIE: With Ordell?
LOUIS: We had done time together already.
MELANIE: Were you a disco guy?
LOUIS: No.
MELANIE: C'mon, don't lie.
LOUIS: I don't like dancing.
MELANIE: Did you ever go I one?
LOUIS: I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars. Who didn't make the cut?
MELANIE: That's a picture of me in Japan.
LOUIS: You been to Japan?
MELANIE: I lived there for about nine months.
LOUIS: You lived in Japan, when?
MELANIE: About five years ago.
LOUIS: Who's arm is that?
MELANIE: That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
LOUIS: Must of made quite an impression.
MELANIE: I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
LOUIS: That sounds like a problem.
MELANIE: Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan. That's Japan.
MELANIE: Wanna fuck?
LOUIS: Sure.
