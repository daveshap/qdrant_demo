AL: You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
GUARD: I guess that's what he looked like.
AL: We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
GUARD: What'd he look like again?
AL: Short fella. Pale face.
GUARD: Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
AL: I didn't see nothin'.
GUARD: Okay. Go on.
