TRACY: I want you to do something for me.
JIM: Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
TRACY: I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
JIM: Oh, is this...? God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
TRACY: Would you sign it for me?
JIM: What a surprise.
TRACY: Take as much room as you want
TRACY: I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
JIM: You'll be fine.
TRACY: I hope so
JIM: You will.
