How do you test buffer overflows in the lab? I'm doing a lot of learning about buffer overflows, and BROP. My problem is how can I test against real software in the lab? I can find a lot of CVE's that contain sever bugs that are open to a buffer overflow attack but no way of testing. By default installing these on my own server will have buffer overflow protections enabled.I've created my own software to test against. That's easy, but I want to test against something real.Any ideas?
