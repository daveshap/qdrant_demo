OLDER WOMAN: Wait!
PUFF: Yes?
OLDER WOMAN: I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.
PUFF: Mother?
OLDER WOMAN: Yes... Derek.
PUFF: It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was... And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
OLDER WOMAN: Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
PUFF: Yes.
OLDER WOMAN: I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
PUFF: I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
GABRIELLE: Hello, my little boy.
PUFF: Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
GABRIELLE: Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
PUFF: Great. God, I've wanted you forever.
GABRIELLE: Say my name.
PUFF: Gabrielle.
GABRIELLE: You remind me so much of Nathan.
PUFF: Like father, like son.
GABRIELLE: You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
PUFF: Woof.
