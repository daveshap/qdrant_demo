Serious question- do kids at your school cheat?
I was curious because I recently found out a former friend of mine got into a T5, and they're the type of person who cheats to get a 100% in a class instead of a 96% (Even though they are both high As). They're very smart, albeit not very kind, they just happen to cheat a lot to keep a 4.0. They're just the type of person to sneak in the ACT math formulas, even though they are good at math, if that makes sense. 

I honestly didn't even realize how big of a thing cheating was until AP World junior year, when people would whisper during the test for answers and get mad if you didn't reply. Students would also brag about how good they are at cheating. 

Anyways, how much do people cheat at your guys' school? And how much do you think it affects their GPA?
