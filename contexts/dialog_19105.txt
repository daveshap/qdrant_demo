SUELEEN: No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
WADE: You think I got any kind of a voice?
SUELEEN: You sure do it loud.
WADE: Is that good?
SUELEEN: It's not bad.
WADE: You think I should take lessons?
SUELEEN: If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
WADE: You serious?
SUELEEN: Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
WADE: Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
SUELEEN: You think it will?
WADE: Sure thing.
