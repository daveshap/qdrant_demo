Since winter break, my friends and I have been writing, voicing, programming, and composing music for a video game that parodies our experience applying to college this year. Hereâ€™s the trailer!

After many months, my friends and I are proud to present a preview of our upcoming game: "Admission Revolutionnaire!" All the writing, voice acting, music comp, and programming is by us. We've been working on this project as a sort of "last hurrah!" before we all part ways for college. It's our way of giving back and saying thanks to the a2c community for all the laughs and guidance over the last \~2 years. I've been a frequent (like x3 / day / every day obsessive) lurker, and I really owe my entire understanding of the application process to you guys. So thank you for being part of this community and making it the ðŸ¤¡y place it is.

So..... what is *Admission Revolutionnaire*? It's what happens when you mash a dating sim with Ace Attorney, sprinkle a little bit of Majora's Mask on top, and resolutely adhere to your theme of making  an "admissions" based game.

\- The game begins Dec. 31. You have 72 hours to apply to all of your colleges! Luckily, your high school counsellor negotiated a special deal with the Elite Admission Officers. Theyâ€™re letting you do 3 days of interviews *instead* of supplements!

\- The Elite Admission Officers are personifications of T20 colleges. Win them over by answering their questions favorably! Increase your chances of getting accepted to their school.

\- **Yale interview dating sim!!!**

\- Investigate the USC admissions scandal! With Paul Ledesma's help, you'll surely blow it wide open.

\- Cleaning your room before recording your Brown video interview minigame.

\- Spreadsheet-creating action. Portal link organizing.

\- A look into the life of CMC and her 4 twin sisters.

\- Last minute scrambling to get Princeton their graded paper.

\- "Why does Columbia want NO context for why I love 'The Perils of Windmills In the Modern World'?"

\- Sit down with your AO and determine which hospitals are your viables and which are your reaches

\- Freaking out when you accidentally send Harvard a pdf that opens, "Congratulations, your computer is equipped with a PDF (Portable Document Format) reader!" instead of your real supplement.

\- And so much more!!! (including an original soundtrack and voice acting!)

If interested, to keep current with game updates, put in your email or phone number [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc9zS6YmHAOjW7ub-mnqEsW2p1kR5JlVk6YzxNG0oK2igA41g/viewform) and I'll  send you a message when there's news.

I really hope you guys enjoy this preview and my friends and I can't wait to share more in the future. If there's enough interest, we might launch a Kickstarter to help realize features we've conceptualized that aren't currently feasible... one of us just needs to be 18 first (which happens in about a week)!

Anyways, good luck over the next two weeks everyone! No matter where you all end up, I'm sure you'll do great! Thanks for making this subreddit so awesome. =)

Edit: Btw, since a handful of artists reached out -- yes, it'd be awesome to have some more artists on the team! Send me a Reddit DM if you might be interested!

Also, if you enjoyed, please consider retweeting on [Twitter!](https://twitter.com/AdmissionRevol1/status/1239238303561306112) Hoping to spread the word there too. :P
