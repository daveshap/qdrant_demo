Why does it seem like no schools publish how much GAs make?
I’ve been admitted (thankfully) to two programs and in looking at GA spots, they finally made the list of opportunities public. There was no indication though of how much they made. These schools are well-known but it does me no good to know that I can get a GA but not afford school. 

The closest I have gotten is a generic paragraph that says “some GA spots can make 50%-100% of tuition and a stipend” but being in a major east coast city (both schools are in this environment) that can be everything. 

Does anyone know of a website where people discuss these or have everything organized to an extent?
