Starting Over
Greetings!


I’m a 34(m) currently working as a freelance comic book cover artist living in the US. Got my permanent resident card a couple of months ago but I’m not planning on continuing in this industry for much longer. 
I have a high school professional diploma in graphic design however, this is something I really do not enjoy doing and, whenever I get recruited by some agency it always has nothing to do with what my resume mentions.
Anyways... Going straight to the point, I’ll be pretty much homeless in a matter of months if I can’t find a job that pays at least 30k a year. Doing all my budgeting, this would be the bare minimum I could get to “survive”. It would obviously depend on city/state since 30k in SF is absolutely nothing, but kinda doable in Seattle. (I currently reside in Florida btw). Does anybody have an idea of what sorts of jobs can I find that allow me to basically live by myself? Right now I’m just trying to go through all my options. I’m good with my hands and I’m confident I could put them to very good use with the proper training... Just don’t know where to look or where to start.

Thanks in advance!
