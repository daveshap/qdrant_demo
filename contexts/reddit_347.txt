Scared to Talk in Class...
Hey guys!

So I need some help. Theres this cute guy in my philosophy class and originally we didnt talk, but one day he started talking to me and we became friends. I started to like him, but I realized he was not interested in me (never really waits for me after class, doesnt really talk unless I start the convo). Since then I havent contributed to class discussions because I dont wanna looked dumb in front of him. How do I stop being nervous and giving this guy so much power over me? I dont want my grade to suffer because of this.

Thank you!!
