HARDY: Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
OSBORNE: I don't know.
STYLES: Tom, where are you going --
HARDY: Home, I'm done.
STYLES: What about the confession?
HARDY: You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
STYLES: What the hell are you talking about --
HARDY: I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
OSBORNE: Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
HARDY: You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
OSBORNE: Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
HARDY: Watch me.
OSBORNE: You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
HARDY: West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
OSBORNE: You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
HARDY: Phenomenal at taking bribes, right?
OSBORNE: I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
HARDY: Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my great second chance"
OSBORNE: But you will.
HARDY: Why do you care?
OSBORNE: Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that. We can do this, Hardy.
