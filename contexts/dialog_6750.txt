REYNOLDS: Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
JACK: What for?
REYNOLDS: For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
JACK: I don't gamble.
REYNOLDS: Ever?
JACK: I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
REYNOLDS: Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
JACK: We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
REYNOLDS: This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
JACK: Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
REYNOLDS: We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
JACK: How?
REYNOLDS: First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again. There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
REYNOLDS: Girlfriend?
JACK: Yes.
REYNOLDS: She's not in the gaming business is she?
JACK: No.
REYNOLDS: This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
JACK: Very impressive.
REYNOLDS: We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
