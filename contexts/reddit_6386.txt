I got hired! Plus- my tips on filling out a memorable (min. wage job/retail) application!
I was underemployed, working part-time retail at a clothing store at the mall.  I've been looking for a second job for months, and finally got hired!  I am now also a cake decorator at a local grocery store.  I had work experience working in a bakery but no cake decorating experience but applied anyway even though they were asking specifically for "experienced cake decorators."  I'm very excited!  Today I finished day two of training.

It's rough looking for minimum wage jobs.  It takes a lot of time.  It's a pain in the ass!  

**Here are some tips I have and things I've done that have helped me get (retail) jobs:**

* Keep applying!  Don't bank on one job.  Put in as many applications as you can.  

* Make a professional looking resume, and staple it on top of your application.  You can even make a cover letter, too if you'd like, but I never did.  (In some cases, I guess a cover letter might be over-kill for this type of job, but I don't know.)

**When you're ready to turn in your application:**

* Go to the store in person dressed very professionally.

* Smile and be nice to everyone you see.  Try to be confident.

* Ask for the manager.

* Shake his/her hand and introduce yourself.  Give him/her your resume + application.  "Hello; how are you.  I'm so-and-so, I'm a student here/new in town.  I'm applying for the [whatever] position."  Smile your face off (but not in a [scary way](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mag4auYoHa1qcja3b.jpg)).  
EDIT: If you're not applying for a specific position but are willing to do whatever job they give you, that can be a strength.  (Some people thinks it's a weakness because it makes you seem direction-less, but it's only a weakness if you let it be.  Realize that if you're open to any position, it can help the company out.  I mentioned that I'm willing to work in different departments, so if a cashier calls out, they can call me in to cover for them, which will help your employer out a lot.)  


**On the application:**

* Write as neatly as possible.  Seriously, take your time.  I have good hand-writing, but I really slow myself down on the applications to make sure everything's clearly legible and spelled correctly.  Use white-out if necessary.

* Of course, fill it out as completely as possible.  

* Sometimes the applications will have optional questions like "What other skills or technical training do you have that could be relevant to this job?"  DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE CHEESY!  I don't have technical training, but on my application, I wrote "Teamwork!"  It's cheesy, sure, but it's also true- in my past jobs I've had to work on teams, and I'm good at it.  You could also write hard-working, fast learner, determined, ambitious, or something along those lines.  If you fill out more info than necessary on the application, it shows that you really do want the job and are willing to put time and thought into your app.

* Also, on some apps, there will be a space with a question like "Why do you want this job?" or "Why do you think you'd be good for this position?" or "Why should we hire you?" or something like that.  Tell them!  They want to know that you want the job for more reasons than just "I need money."  If you like the products they sell or the atmosphere of the store, tell them that's a reason.  If you could be passionate about the position, tell them!  On my cake decorator application, I knew I was lacking the experience they wanted so in this section, I wrote a short paragraph something along the lines of: "I loved my time working at [competitor] in the Bakery.  I liked the work, and it's given me relevant experience.  I wasn't a cake decorator; however, I had some experience baking/icing cupcakes/writing on cakes/blahblah, and I really want to be a cake decorator.  I may need some training, but I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  I'm reliable, and always show up on time.  Thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you."  <- I think that answer is what got me the job.  When I came in for my interview, it wasn't really an interview.  We chatted casually for a bit, talked about what I'd done before in the bakery, and then she showed me the area, introduced me around, had me ice a cake, and then gave me my uniform!!  

* Be genuine.  Don't take my advice and say you're great at teamwork if you go into the interview and can't back up that claim with a story about how you once had to be a team player in some work scenario.  Just be honest, be yourself, and be willing to try new things.  

Well, I think that's about it.  I hope some of these tips help any of you looking for retail jobs.  These are tips I've acquired within the past two-to-three years of looking for work and working.  :)
