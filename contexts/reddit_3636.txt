A kind gesture turned into a date.
Ladies â€” being open and present is your best asset. 

I was at a street fair/festival this afternoon. Mind you, Iâ€™ve never been in this city and Iâ€™m here for several days for work. I wanted to check out the fair. Very crowded and hot. I was standing at a pub table watching the next band set up their equipment. Just hanging out and people watching. 

I noticed a man in front of me who looked appealing. He seemed alone, so I got his attention and asked if he was solo. He was, so I invited him to post up and share my table (a place to set his beer, etc). 

We had a very nice chat and he asked me out to dinner. Simple as that. 

We exchanged numbers and have plans for him to take me to dinner later or tomorrow night (depends on my work schedule). 

He gave me his full name and place of employment (so I can look him up and make sure heâ€™s not a creep â€” his suggestion). 

All because I was open and saw an opportunity to make a connection. 

He thinks Iâ€™m cute, too. ðŸ˜Š
