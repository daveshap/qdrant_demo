How bad is WEP security presently? I just discovered that a wireless network that I frequently connect to still uses WEP security. How bad is this for me, the end user of the network? What steps should I take to secure my devices, accounts, etc. until such time as the network switches to using WPA?EDIT: I do not have control over the network's security, I am an end user and I wish to protect myself from the implications of using a network with WEP. I do not care about issues that the access point faces, only the issues that I might personally face as a person who uses the network. I also do not care about theoretical exploits (such as traffic being decryptable) as much as specific things which might be different (such as people being able to steal my login information).
