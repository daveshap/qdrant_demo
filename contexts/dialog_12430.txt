LARRY: O.K.
FRANK: Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
JULIA: Keep your voice down.
FRANK: Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.
JULIA: You're hurting.
FRANK: You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
