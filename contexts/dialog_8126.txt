BUD: Where's the other guy? Buzz.
PATCHETT: He no longer works for me. Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
BUD: Thanks, but no thanks.
PATCHETT: Against your code?
BUD: I don't have one. Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it. How come?
PATCHETT: Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
BUD: No.
PATCHETT: Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
BUD: That's right.
PATCHETT: Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it. I run call girls. Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well. I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt. I sense you share this feeling.
BUD: Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
PATCHETT: I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket. She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
BUD: You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
PATCHETT: Wait. Our deal still holds?
PATCHETT: I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
BUD: What little studio?
PATCHETT: There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner. Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake. I use girls who look like movie stars. Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
BUD: That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
PATCHETT: No, Mr. White. Pierce Morehouse Patchett. Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you. If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address? I doubt she knows anything, but --
BUD: I got her address.
PATCHETT: Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
