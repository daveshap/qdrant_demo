DIETER: I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
DIETER: If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.

DIETER: Me.
BURR: No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
DIETER: I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
