SEAN: No. Thank you.
WILL: Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
SEAN: Only if you grab my ass.
WILL: See ya.
SEAN: Good luck.
LAMBEAU: Will.
WILL: Hey, how you doin'?
LAMBEAU: You know, you're no longer required to come here.
WILL: I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
LAMBEAU: Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
WILL: Thank you.
LAMBEAU: I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
WILL: Bullshit.
LAMBEAU: This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
WILL: I appreciate that.
LAMBEAU: Yes.
WILL: Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
LAMBEAU: Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
LAMBEAU: Hello, Sean.
SEAN: Come in.
LAMBEAU: Sean...
SEAN: Me too.
LAMBEAU: So I hear you're taking some time.
SEAN: Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
LAMBEAU: Where're you going?
SEAN: I don't know. India maybe.
LAMBEAU: Why there?
SEAN: Never been.
LAMBEAU: Do you know when you'll be back?
SEAN: I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
LAMBEAU: I got one of those too.
SEAN: You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
