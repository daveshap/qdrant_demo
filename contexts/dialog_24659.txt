NICK: The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
KAT: Oh, no.
NICK: Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnâ€™t be violated.
