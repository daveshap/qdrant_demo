Probability of a measurement with uncertainty covariance being generated by a normal distribution I have the following situation:A set of Kalman filters with the same model, each with its owncurrent estimated state and state covariance.A measurement with a covariance matrix expressing its uncertainty.And the following problem:I want to decide to which KF to assign the measurement based on the likelihood of the measurement being generated by the random distribution, represented by the current state and state covariance of the KF.I know about the Mahalanobis distance, but that doesn't take into account uncertainty covariance of the measurement, only covariance of the random distribution.I also know about the Bhattacharyya distance, but if I understand it correctly, that measures the similarity of two random distributions, and I'm not sure if that's the same thing as what I want to do.Is there a way to calculate the likelihood of a measurement with a known uncertainty covariance matrix being generated by a random distribution?If possible, can you suggest a better metric to decide to which KF to assign the measurement?Thank you.
