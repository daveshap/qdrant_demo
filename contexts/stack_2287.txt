How to save soldiers mind controlled by the warlock in Xcom 2 war of the chosen? So i'm doing a retaliation mission and my colonel reaper(elena dragunova) is mind controlled by the warlock. the problem is he is immune to flashbangs. Also waiting 4 turns for the mind control to be over is not an option since the dumb resistance  soldiers keep shooting her just like they would shoot a regular enemy. i alt-f4'd the game(ironman/legend) which i am not proud of. i do have the frost bomb but i don't think freezing the warlock or elena is going to help me. the worst thing is she is not going to bleed out since technically she is an enemy(i'm assuming this).How do i save my reaper? :(EDIT: I have no psi operatives, all remaining 5 soldiers have plasma,beam weapons and of rank major with bladestorm and untouchable abilities.No mind shields, no grenades.3 berserkers, 2 mutons,2 codexes,a chrysallid producing thing, a faceless, warlock with 50hp and 7 armor.On a More Important Note: The Objective here is to keep her from dying, everything(and i do mean everything) else is secondary.
