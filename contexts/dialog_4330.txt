ROBERT: Feeling better?
FRANCESCA: Much.
ROBERT: Is the dizziness gone?
FRANCESCA: I think so.
ROBERT: I better go. You sure you're all right? It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
FRANCESCA: I feel so embarrassed.
ROBERT: Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
FRANCESCA: But I... We don't even know each other.
ROBERT: You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
FRANCESCA: Would you like to stay for dinner? There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
ROBERT: That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
