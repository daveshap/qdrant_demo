Rejected within 3 Minutes ??
I applied for an entry level job. Not my words, the job description said it is an entry level job, for this BIG social media company and according to me I was alright candidate (enough for contesting in interviews atleast) if not good. After applying, I checked my email to star the notification so that i can keep the record of the emails but I see the company has already sent me a rejection email.   


I found it so weird.   


The application had no question which would have an "automated rejection" just my CV. I applied for higher positions in the same company (twice) before also and they rejected me.   


My question is Did they read my CV in 3 mins. and reject me (If yes then is being "Overqualified" a thing) or big companies have the policy of rejecting applicants if they reject them once.
