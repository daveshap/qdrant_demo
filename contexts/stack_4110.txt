OFAC declaration for travelling to Cuba from US I will be travelling from New-York to Cuba as my flight back to Europe is from Havana. I will buy the tourist card from the US airlines I am traveling with but I need to select one option in OFAC form out of 12 options. What should I select? I will be in Havana for tourism for three days before as it seems tourism or transiting is not an option.
