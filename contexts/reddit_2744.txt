Quit My Full-Time Job For Mental Health. Happy Now, But Not Proud of New Job. Does Anyone Else Feel This Way?
I quit my full-time (dream) job a couple of weeks ago after only 8+ months there. While it was within the publishing field that I had always dreamed of working in, it also came with a lot of stress and it took its toll on my already flaring anxiety and depression. Not to mention the pay was low with very little potential for advancement. 

Cut to the present, I am now working a simple full-time job (not complex in any way) in a vastly different industry with even less pay and no benefits, but...I am so happy! I originally meant to work there part-time but the full-time just kind of landed in my lap. I barely have anything new to learn and my brain has time to relax. I can actually come home with energy! 

Does it suck not having benefits and extra perks? Yeah, but the mental and physical toil I was in forced me to go to the doctor more anyways. 

I think the only aspect that really has me hesitant...is the fact that I'm not really...PROUD of the current job I do. Its not what I pictured for myself and certainly not at this age. Its not a "young professional" type of career. And I don't really want to tell anyone about it.

Does anyone else feel this way?
