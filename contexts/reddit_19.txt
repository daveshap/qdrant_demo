Im a straight, white, cis male. Help! (?) [Rant]

First off, I know that I’m probably going to get a lot of hate for this post, but Im asking for advice here, not to be shamed for my race and gender I was given at birth. I also want to say that I do not mean to offend anyone, as I am a strong supporter of women’s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and right to any and all other groups. I have many friends from all different groups and love all of them equally. I recognize that all of these groups face tons of oppression regularly, and I hate that they do.

Now to the hard part...

I am a white, straight cis male. I am quite comfortable with who I am. I am also hated on regularly because of they way I was born. People say that I don’t know what its like to truly be discriminated against, and they are right. But that doesn’t mean that my feelings can’t be hurt if the gender I was born with and identify as tends to be seen as non-oppressed. I have been told by many people that my opinions or value to society is non-existent because of who I am. These people tend to be major LGBTQ+ supporters or strong feminists, even though I agree with them. My romantic partner is a gender-neutral-ish but significantly more on the side of female (I dont know the proper term) and bisexual person with strong latin roots. I would do anything to protect or stand up for their rights and love them indescribably. However, I also want to stand up for my own social rights and have a voice. I want to have a value to society. So, as a straight, white, cis male, what should I do/say to get through life without being ridiculed?
