WAITRESS: No substitutions.
BOBBY: What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
WAITRESS: No. We have tomatoes.
BOBBY: But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
WAITRESS: Only what's on the menu... A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
BOBBY: I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
WAITRESS: I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
BOBBY: Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
WAITRESS: I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
BOBBY: What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
WAITRESS: Would you like to talk to the manager?
PALM: Hey, mack!
BOBBY: Shut up. You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
WAITRESS: I don't make the rules.
BOBBY: Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
WAITRESS: One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
BOBBY: Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
WAITRESS: You want me to hold the chicken.
BOBBY: Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
