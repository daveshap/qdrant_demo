Listing research in progress on CV for job search
I'm in Computer Science and hoping to graduate this year. I'm looking into starting the job search soon and looking for research positions in industry.

Would it be advisable to list work in progress under Publications as "In Progress"? My dissertation publications are pretty backloaded in that my most important work will be submitted just before I defend, so leaving them out of my Publications section will make my CV look very weak. Is there any additional value added to the CV if I wait until the work is submitted to put "In Submission" instead?

Thanks in advance!
