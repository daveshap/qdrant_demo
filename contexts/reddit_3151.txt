What counts as "job-hopping" and how much of a killer is it when applying new places?
I had one position I was at for four years and since then I haven't stayed at a place longer than 9 months due to a place going out of bushiness, a toxic work environment(when asked in interviews why I left this job I lie and say something nicer), and just one job that was part-time to earn money while I looked for a better job. I'm four months into a new position and am really miserable because they lied heavily in the job description, this place is definitely going out of bushiness soon, and my boss is a narcissist. I have been looking for new jobs on the side and at one interview for a job that I was overqualified for they told me no due to job-hopping. I haven't heard back from many places that I'm qualified for and I was wondering if my work history is killing my chances and how to best deal with?
