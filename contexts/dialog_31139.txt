RAY: You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie. You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
SUZIE: You got something against cigarettes?
RAY: Yeah, they're bad for your health. I'm tryin' to look out for you...
SUZIE: That's cop bullshit.
RAY: Well, you're half right. Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
SUZIE: About what?
RAY: Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts. Somebody's got to go.
SUZIE: Is this supposed to mean something to me? What triangle?
RAY: You, Kelly, Sam.
SUZIE: I don't have to listen to this. And you can't shove me around. I have friends now...
RAY: Is that what you think? You have friends? Is that what they told you?
SUZIE: I don't mean who you're thinking. I have other friends...
RAY: Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to. We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
