ETHAN: What did you think you were doing!
NYAH: I wasn't thinking! Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
ETHAN: - you who don't have a conscience.
NYAH: I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
ETHAN: No.
NYAH: Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late. Before I start killing people.
ETHAN: No.
NYAH: I'm infected with Chimera. You know you don't have a choice. Just do it now.
