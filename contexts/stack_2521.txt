Performing COST PATH in ArcMap? I have a tiff raster dataset serving as cost raster, created a start point and destination point serving as feature source data for performing COST PATH in ArcMap 10.4.Since the tiff raster layer contains no attribute table, I performed INT to get one. However, this new-made attribute table does not contain the value for each pixel.I have also performed RASTER to POINT to get the value of each pixel. But I cannot join this table to INT attribute table.  I am wondering if this is the reason I failed to get a normal result of COST DISTANCE  and COST BACKLINK.Besides, I have already tried performing PATHWAY in IDRISI. But it failed too.
