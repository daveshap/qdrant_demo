Removing summoned ender dragon (Minecraft.) I summoned an ender dragon in minecraft realms (in the overworld) and it just sits there and makes a lot of noise. I have tried many things to remove it but it will not work. (Cheats are on!) It does not move or shoot fireballs it just makes a lot of noise and stays in one place. Please someone help me I really need to remove this...
