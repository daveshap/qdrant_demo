BOND: He survived?
M: The doctor who saved him couldn’t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he’s a dead man.
M: The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
BOND: ‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
M: Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
BOND: He’s not through yet. Renard doesn’t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there’s more coming in. He’s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline. And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
