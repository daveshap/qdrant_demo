What are the legal differences between the Pennsylvania lockdown that SCOTUS supported and the Wisconsin lockdown that their state Supreme Court struck down?
Here's the situation I'm curious about:

On May 8, 2020, Governor Tom Wolf was sued by several businesses that essentially argued the following:

> The Pennsylvania businesses argued Wolf's lockdown order was unconstitutional and filed an emergency request with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court arguing it went beyond Wolf's authority.

The Supreme Court [unanimously declined to lift the order](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-pennsylvania-stay-at-home-order-businesses/)

Fast forward to today, [Wisconsin's Supreme Court just ruled that Governor Tony Evers' stay-at-home extension was unconstitutional.](https://www.nbc15.com/content/news/Wisconsin-Supreme-Court-blocks-Evers-stay-home-extension-570448161.html)

In light of the recent Supreme Court decision, I have a lot of questions about these cases because I'm admittedly not an expert on the legal surroundings of either, but I'm curious how the results can be different.

1. Are these cases arguing two different things, which is why the courts came to different conclusions?

2. What *are* the differences between these cases, or is this something that will be appealed up to the Supreme Court and ultimately the same ruling will apply?
