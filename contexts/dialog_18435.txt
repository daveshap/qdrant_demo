CEDAR: Newspaperman?
COBB: Wants to know who the heir is.
CEDAR: Hang up.
COBB: Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorneyâ€”
CEDAR: Hang up.
COBB: Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days. Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
CEDAR: I'm not interested in the newspapers.
COBB: But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
CEDAR: Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
COBB: It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
