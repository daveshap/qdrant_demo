If I want to be a pilot in Europe will I basically be okay if I don't have a college degree?
By the way I don't necessarily want to be an airline pilot, I am okay with many different pilot jobs, so long as it's not military. My eyes are mostly on Ireland and the UK. Do you guys think I should be good there if I don't have a college degree?
