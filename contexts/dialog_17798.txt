RICH LADY: Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
JOE: Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
RICH LADY: I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
JOE: You sure are a pretty lady.
RICH LADY: You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
JOE: No, ma'am, I'm not.
RICH LADY: Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
