How do I tell my current supervisor?
Alright, I’m currently a grad assistant with conferences at my school. Conferences is a pretty big program within Housing and yet, it’s literally composed of my supervisor, who is the Assistant Director, and 2 under grad students, and me until the summer begins and we hire the conference assistants. 

This is my first semester in grad school, educational counseling program. A speaker came to my class and advertised an immediate position with the Counseling and Psychological Services department called Community Mental Health Coordinator who would work with her to push an initiative on suicide awareness and train 10k students. The speaker got the grant for this 2-2.5 year position that pays $18/hour for 20 hours a week, she also offered being the mentor of the person offered the role. 

My current supervisor and I have planned the whole semester of how to recruit for summer and we’re currently interview interns, but this assistant position is not direct experience. It pays less and I work less hours. 

The thing is, if I get this job, my supervisor will be left by herself to do everything.

I’m going to apply for the new job because nothing is certain until I’m offered the role. I did my undergrad here and have experience/skills. 

How do I tell my supervisor about this possible opportunity?  Do I wait until offered the role?
