Help for measurable PIP objectives for ‘subjective’ performance?
Advice and examples for drafting up a PIP for ‘hard to measure’ objectives? 

Eg -, autonomy, accountability, decision making and problem solving?


I really want to help this person to perform and nothing I am doing is working so far. They seem to not understand the basic elements of their role, and can’t do things without a lot of micro management and hand holding. This is hindering their own progress and despite coaching I can’t get them out of this mindset. HR have asked for a PIP and I haven’t done one before. HR agreed it’s tricky because it’s not the output of their role, it’s about their performance level required enact the role . 


They are completing the outputs asked so I can’t base it on that. It’s just that output is low because of their behavior. E,g  primarily it’s the amount of documentation and hand holding that’s showing they are not performing at a level required. (Need ‘how to ‘ documents for basic tasks, are asking me to make decisions for them consistently despite various coaching, and also behaving in a negative manner when interacting with others or receiving feedback)


However I don’t know how to phrase that in a PIP?

How can you show/ give the opportunity for them to improve on what seems to be intangible outcomes?

Ideas for actions they can take and ways to measure improvement? 

Any examples desperately needed.
