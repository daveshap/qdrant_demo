Have any older-ish(35+) adults used a career guidance counselor/professional to help you decide on a new career or a career direction? If so, what was your experience?
I’m almost 40 and I’ve had a bunch of random jobs, but never really any career direction. I’m not an overly passionate person and and I’ve never really felt any urge for a specific job or career path. 

With that being said, I’d like to kinda settle down and stop skipping from job to job and find something I like. 

Has anyone used a professional career advisor and if so, did it help/was it worth it?

Thanks
