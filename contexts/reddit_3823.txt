Ladies, have you ever just picked on the fact that one of your guy friends like you without them telling you and what gave it away?
Iâ€™ve heard some girls are oblivious but some girls can tell pretty quickly. For those of you that could tell a guy is into you without him telling you, how did you pick up on it?
