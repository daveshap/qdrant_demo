\"increased no cost\" vs \"did not increase the cost\" I think this sentence is correct:<blockquote>  This action increased no cost.</blockquote>I can say the same as:<blockquote>  This action did not increase the cost.</blockquote>I prefer the former, because it's shorter.  However, could one claim that the latter is preferred?
