ED: Goddamn landlord.
DOLORES: I told you this was gonna happen.
ED: Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
DOLORES: That's moronic. Why would a bit player impress a backer?
ED: Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry? I blew it! I thought she was rich.
DOLORES: That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
ED: <u>I didn't dump you</u>! Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!
DOLORES: You're a fuckin' mess.
ED: So WHAT?? Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
DOLORES: I'm going to my mother's.
ED: Does she have room for me?
