CHRISTY: Is this all the food I get?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Yes. Until breakfast.
CHRISTY: That's tomorrow! Don't you have any snacks? Machines?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
CHRISTY: My what?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Your cell. Your room.
CHRISTY: You were right the first time. Is this like, solitary? The cooler? Where's the furniture?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Our lives are simple. We have little need for material possessions.
CHRISTY: Right, sure thing. But what about, like, appliances? Like a little color portable? Boom box?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Useless distractions.
CHRISTY: It's like the Stone Age. The room time forgot. What about a phone?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: And whom would you call?
CHRISTY: Oh, I don't know... Satan?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Your cell is more than adequate.
CHRISTY: Right. So what do we do now? Ping- Pong? Row over to the monastery?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: It is nine p.m. Pleasant dreams.
CHRISTY: Wait. No. You're kidding. Lights out? At nine? My day's just starting.
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I'm sure. If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life. And its direction. Or lack thereof.
CHRISTY: What's wrong with my life?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: From all I've heard, just about everything. Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.
