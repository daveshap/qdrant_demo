Received my tax refund and am debt free!
Tax refund was deposited this morning.
Paid off every credit card and put $1k that was left over in my savings/emergency fund.

We've been living a frugal lifestyle and selling on ebay on the side. Our goal is to be homeowners by 2021. Paying my cards off will boost my FICO to over 720.

Yes I wanted a newer tv but don't need it. Yes I want to splurge on a new phone. But my current one is fine.
