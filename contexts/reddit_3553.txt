Asked for some answers and got it... :-(
A guy was giving me mixed signals so I straight up asked him what his intentions were and he told me “isn’t it obvious?” Blabla but eventually told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship but still wants to remain friends. After this whole convo, the next day he barely talked to me and our dynamics were different. Pretty sad about it but whatever! Entering the new year with some clarity! No to mixed signals in 2020!
