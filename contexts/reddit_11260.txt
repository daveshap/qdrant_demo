I created a chatbot to help people with anxiety and stress!
He guys! I have been working on this project for a while now and wanted to share it with you guys:

[www.iamfeelinganxious.com](https://www.iamfeelinganxious.com/)

It’s a digital coach that helps in difficult moments – whether it’s feelings of stress or panic, losing sleep, repetitive worrying or procrastinating.

The chatbot guides people through quick and easy-to-use exercises, such as short meditations, mindfulness and CBT techniques. The goal is that when you leave the site, you should feel a little better than before.

I hope I can help out a lot of people this way! :)
