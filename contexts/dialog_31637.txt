SKY: French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
XANDER: Alright, so I'll get more.
SKY: It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
XANDER: Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
SKY: What...?
XANDER: I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
SKY: You're serious?
XANDER: Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
SKY: This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
XANDER: I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
SKY: You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
XANDER: You're not exactly going anywhere" yourself."
SKY: You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
