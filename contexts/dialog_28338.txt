MAGDA: I'm buying bananas tonight.
MARY: Why?
MAGDA: Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
MARY: Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
MAGDA: Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
MARY: So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
MAGDA: Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
MARY: Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
MAGDA: Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
