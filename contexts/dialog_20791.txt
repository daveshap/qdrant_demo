ANDREW: You survived your first gay party intact.
JOE: Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
ANDREW: Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
JOE: Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
JOE: When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
ANDREW: Uh huh...
JOE: Beckett?
ANDREW: Charles. Okay. Miller?
JOE: What?
ANDREW: Do you... pray?
