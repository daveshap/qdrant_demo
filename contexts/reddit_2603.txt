Has anybody had career setbacks due to mental illness?
I'm currently working two jobs, a custom framer at a craft store and as a childcare worker. I have a BA in psychology, and I did well in college despite having a mental illness. I got an internship as a case worker for the county and have worked as a behavior therapist. As the years went by my mental illness got worse and I wasn't able to function. Symptoms of mania got worse. Depression got worse to the point where I was hospitalized twice. It was very difficult. When I worked psychology-related fields I found out that the field was too overwhelming for me. I just couldn't handle it. It's been 5 years since I graduated, and I've been stable. I go to therapy and take my medication. I use coping skills. I've been able to hold a retail job for 2 years and have had my childcare job for 3 months. I have an internship in an office as a development associate. I feel very lost because I struggle with money alot, and this stresses me out alot. I hope to find a job in an office soon, so I can have some stability. Eventually I would like to go back to school to become a speech language pathologist or an accountant. I'm not sure yet. 

Again, I feel lost and behind in life, but I'm trying really hard.
