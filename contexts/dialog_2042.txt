CAROL: You wanna dance?
MELVIN: I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
CAROL: And?
MELVIN: No... ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
MELVIN: No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
CAROL: Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
MELVIN: That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
CAROL: That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
MELVIN: Okay.
CAROL: And mean it...
MELVIN: Can we order first?
MELVIN: Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer. Baked or fries?
CAROL: Fries.
MELVIN: One baked -- one fries.
