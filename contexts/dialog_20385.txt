KAREN: Leave it where it is.
CHINO: Wait. You not Adele?
KAREN: I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest. Put the gun on the table. I mean, now.
CHINO: Oh. Then this must be Adele...
KAREN: Put it down or I'll shoot.
CHINO: You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
KAREN: What do you want to bet?
CHINO: I could walk out of here.
KAREN: If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
KAREN: You can live or die, it's up to you.
CHINO: Oh, is that right? You going to shoot me? Nice girl like you? I don't think so.
KAREN: You don't, huh?
