Can't connect to Steam servers and other gaming servers on Windows 10 I have been having an issue with Steam. Whenever I try to log into it, it tells me that it is having trouble connecting to the Steam servers, and won't let me log in. I used to be able to use Steam perfectly fine, but I started getting issues after I moved. I have tried re-installing, deleting ClientRegistry.blob, and everything else. I even tried replacing my router, as it was a bit out of date. Despite all of these, none of them have helped.I am also having issues connecting to the Warthunder servers outside of Steam.  It says I have limited Ethernet, but I am able to use the internet on my computer. Another thing that is not working are .io websites. I am unable to connect to them.Despite these things, I am able to use the browser version of steam.
