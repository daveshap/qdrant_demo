What would happen to 2 separate photons on an uninterrupted path So I am a middle schooler and from what i understand, photons can interact with surrounding particle via gravity. If this is true, would 2 photons on an uninterrupted and completely isolated path eventually gravitate towards each other and pass each other, then gravitate again in an oscillatory fashion, while the distance from an imaginary midpoint slowly decreases. If this would happen, wouldn\u2019t we be incapable of telling this combination of two photons apart from a single photon other than its increased energy than a normal photon and increased gravitational pull.
