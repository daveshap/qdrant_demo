Is the bar really this low?
I'm a 21M guy and I think I look alright but kinda besides the point.  I feel like every girl I go out with is so ecstatic to have a dude that isn't making lood comments right off the bat, or super awkward or just normal for the most part.  Like I don't think I'm a superhero by any means but dating has just seemed so easy lately.  Is it just my age range, is it being in a big city?  Has anyone else male or female noticed this?



Edit: I truly did not know this would be so divisive.  I also have never written out lewd before so pls forgive me.
