VERONICA: How much money did you leave up there?
DANTE: Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
VERONICA: You're trusting.
DANTE: Why do you say that?
VERONICA: How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
DANTE: Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
VERONICA: Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
DANTE: I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
VERONICA: Do you think anyone can see us down here?
DANTE: Why? You wanna have sex or something?
VERONICA: Ooh! Can we?!
DANTE: Really?
VERONICA: I was kidding.
DANTE: Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
VERONICA: Typically male point of view.
DANTE: How do you figure?
VERONICA: You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
DANTE: Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
VERONICA: Be there?""
DANTE: Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
VERONICA: How flattering.
DANTE: Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
VERONICA: Oh, you think so?
DANTE: A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
VERONICA: And I actually date you?
DANTE: Something wrong?
VERONICA: I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just being there"-as you put it-is not enough."
DANTE: I touched a nerve.
VERONICA: I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
DANTE: It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
VERONICA: You were making a generalization about broads!""
DANTE: These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
VERONICA: How many?
DANTE: How many what?
VERONICA: How many girls have you slept with?
DANTE: How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
VERONICA: We might have; I don't remember. How many?
DANTE: Including you?
VERONICA: It better be up to and including me.
DANTE: Twelve.
VERONICA: You've slept with twelve different girls?
DANTE: Including you; yes.
DANTE: What the hell was that for?
VERONICA: You're a pig.
DANTE: Why'd you hit me?
VERONICA: Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
DANTE: Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
VERONICA: Three.
DANTE: Three?
VERONICA: Three including you.
DANTE: You've only had sex with three different people?
VERONICA: I'm not the pig you are.
DANTE: Who?
VERONICA: You!
DANTE: No; who were the three, besides me?
VERONICA: John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
DANTE: Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
VERONICA: I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
DANTE: Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
VERONICA: Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
DANTE: They put up the least amount of struggle.
VERONICA: After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
DANTE: All right. Name it.
VERONICA: I want you to come with me on Monday.
DANTE: Where?
VERONICA: To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
DANTE: Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
VERONICA: It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
DANTE: Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
DANTE: Shit! Why are we getting up?
VERONICA: Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
VERONICA: Willam!
WILLAM: Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
VERONICA: No, I'm just visiting my man. Dante, this is Willam Black. This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.
