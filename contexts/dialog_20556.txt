GABRIEL: He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
SUSAN: He left us.
GABRIEL: I know he did and he's sorry. He'll come back as soon as he can.
GABRIEL: There are some letters here from him. Some are just to you.
SUSAN: I don't care. I hate him.
GABRIEL: You don't hate him.
SUSAN: Yes, I do. I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
MARION: She spoke? Susan spoke?
GABRIEL: Full sentences. As if she had been speaking all along.
MARION: I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it...
