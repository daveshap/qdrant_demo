LOTTE: Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
MAXINE: Hi, uh. Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. Ever want to be someone else?" No
CRAIG: Why aren't you at work?
LOTTE: I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing. I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
CRAIG: What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
LOTTE: Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
CRAIG: This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
