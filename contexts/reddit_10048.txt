Resume help!
hello hello!

So I'm starting my M.Ed in Higher Education program starting in May and I've already landed a great graduate fellowship advising position (yay!). Looking at my resume, I have some jobs I worked when I was a teenager (working cash registers, as a barista, etc.) still listed on there. I've been in job interviews where I've been asked about these positions, but I've also heard that having these jobs listed is unnecessary/annoying in the job application process as well. 

So my question is: should I still include those jobs on there, or should I only include things relevant to Higher Ed? 

Thank you!!
