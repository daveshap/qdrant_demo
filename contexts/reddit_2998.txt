If you had a good relationship with your boss, would you let him or her know that you are looking for another job?
For context, I have no complaints about my job other than an the unexpected 2 and a half hour minimum commute after the company (acquired company in a large single branded portfolio company, still being held by the acquisition company) last minute relocated the office. It used to take me 5 minutes to get from home to office before the relocation.

Edit: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has responded - a lot of great insight and advice and it's so appreciated!
