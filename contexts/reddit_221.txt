HELP ASAP
ok so my “friends with benefits” boyfriend’s birthday is on Friday and I have no clue what to get him! He told me today that his birthday is on Friday so it’s super duper close and have no clue what to do! We enjoy the office (the show) but none  of the stores have what I want  and he likes legos (lol he’s turning 15 and is a geek hahaha) but they’re way too pricey in target and Walmart. So please could someone give me ideas on what to give him it would mean the world to me, thanks!
