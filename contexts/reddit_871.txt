Do you guys need constant reassurance that everyone is not mad at you?
I always assume the worst. And now that we’re have to practice social distancing it’s making it a lot easier to think negative thoughts. I know they are irrational but sometimes my mind just convinces me that they are true. I feel like I need constant reassurance from my friends so I know they aren’t mad me even though it makes no sense for them to be mad at me because there has been no actual conflict between us. I guess since I haven’t physically seen any of my friends it has gotten really had to stay on track mentally. Like before of this quarantine started we use to spend almost all day everyday together, now everything is through text and for me, I would rather talk to someone face to face so I know what their tone of voice is. Sometimes my mind just thinks really stupid things and it’s really hard to stop it. Does anybody else feel this way too?
