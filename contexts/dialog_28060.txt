MAX: Not impressed, are you?
LUCY: Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
MAX: So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
LUCY: You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job...
MAX: But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
LUCY: I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children. Work with kids in some way. Teenagers, maybe. And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
MAX: Yeah. Runaways, mostly. They come from all over. Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean. Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
LUCY: I hear this is the decade for cute.
