If someone says to you that they had a good time and want to see you again etc, PLEASE say it back to them if you feel the same way
I met up with a guy last week and it went really well and we’re still texting. I keep telling him that I want to see him again and that I miss him and can’t wait to hold him again and he just replies with stuff like “You will again soon” and “Awwww you’re so cute”. I just want to know that he feels the same way about me so I said to him “So you don’t miss me thennnnn” in a jokey way and he said that he thought it was just a given that he misses me too. No it’s not a given. Sometimes you just have to say things explicitly otherwise they will never know. Just wanted to give this small bit of advice to people.
