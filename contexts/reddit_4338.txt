I wanted to kill myself, now I'm the happiest I've ever been... My Battle with depression.
I made a video on my YouTube channel talking about my lowest point and talking about this wasn't easy but I feel that I had to share it and overcome it. I was in a place where I was genuinely tired of living. After lots and lots of trial and error, I pulled myself out of that and now I am the happiest I've ever been. I became a YouTuber. No not famous of "successful" by other people's standards, but I use my platform to talk about mental health, self-growth, and I challenge my audience to get out of their comfort zone, because the more you experience the more you grow as a person. When you grow as a person you start to identify who you are, what you like and what actually makes you happy, inevitably "curing your depression" I've seen this work so many times but I was too blind to notice it while I was suffering, then I dedicated myself to study philosophy and psychology. I make films trying to help people and as long as I can affect someone positively, I consider that success. I encourage you to check out this video, and if you enjoy it please subscribe more stuff will be coming soon.
