NILES: Looks all right. It's big enough and off the street.
GARFIELD: I don't know. This is kinda short notice. I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
NILES: Got to. Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century.
TWIST: We'll take it. You manage the building at the end of the alley?
OLD MAN: For fifteen years.
TWIST: I'll need a room over there that faces this way. How much a week?
OLD MAN: Only rents by the month. Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
TWIST: This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
OLD MAN: Never heard of the place.
GARFIELD: Been a while since I stocked a wire store. Not many mobs playing that anymore.
NILES: All we need is the bookie setup for now. We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
GARFIELD: All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand. That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand. I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
NILES: C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
GARFIELD: You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya? It's gonna take hours just to clean it up. Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item. Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
NILES: Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
