CATHERINE: That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
BOBBY: Thank you.
CATHERINE: I was really very moved by the way you...
CATHERINE: Is that funny?
BOBBY: It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
CATHERINE: Why?
BOBBY: Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
CATHERINE: It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
BOBBY: I didn't have any.
CATHERINE: You had no inner feeling?
BOBBY: None.
CATHERINE: Then I must have been supplying it.
BOBBY: Wait...
CATHERINE: Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
BOBBY: What?
CATHERINE: At being a fake.
BOBBY: Catherine...
CATHERINE: No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
