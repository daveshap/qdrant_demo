I hate that even when I am being rational in my head and know I'm not *actually* upset about something, there's nothing I can do to not have the physical feeling of anxiety. My chest tightening, having a hard time breathing, the nausea.
Like wtf if I can soothe myself in my brain and know I'm good why can't my body agree !!!!!!!
