PHIL: Hey, shut up will ya?
CHUCK: It was a bad dream...
ROBIN: It was so real...
CHUCK: Here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up! You'll be out of it. You'll wake up.
ROBIN: Who told you that?
CHUCK: My dad.
ROBIN: It works?
CHUCK: Swear to God. Only good advice he ever gave me. Now, go back to sleep.
