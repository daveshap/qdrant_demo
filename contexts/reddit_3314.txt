I hate my job, is it worth pursuing meaningful work again?
I work for a high end sales company in a really beautiful location which I initially thought was the perfect job. It's been about half a year now of working there and I have begun to detest it so much. I am trying to gain clarity on my next move. Here are the reasons. 

1. You get talked down to and shouted by rich people almost everyday, which is incredibly frustrating especially when you're from a poor background.
2. The business in general is very discriminatory. They only hire white, attractive people (usually females) for customer facing work. Whereas anyone of colour - or anyone who doesn't fit into this category is hidden away - which is something I hate being a part of.
3. The company's customer care is incredibly poor. You essentially have to ask for contributions from the customers if something goes wrong which is very awkward and you get a lot of abuse for it. The business is only about money and it is glaringly obvious. I do realise this is what business is all about. However, I am not money orientated and is draining me to the core.

I started this job because I wanted to open an ethical clothing chain - because I hate fast-fashion and I thought it would be good to get more of an insight into business. However, I'm starting to think that business is not the right path for me.

I used to work as a Support Worker for children with disabilities and wanted to go into mental health work. I am considering trying this again because I get no satisfaction from my work at all.
