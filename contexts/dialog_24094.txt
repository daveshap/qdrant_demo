VINCE: Well?
JOEY: It didn't work, Vince.
VINCE: You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
WILLY: We both missed.
VINCE: Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
JOEY: Right.
VINCE: So, take it off.
WILLY: Strip down a nun? You want us to fry?
JOEY: For like, twelve zillion eternities?
VINCE: I'm telling you, she's not a nun! Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
JOEY: Maybe pants.
WILLY: A sweater.
JOEY: And then we can ice her. No nun, no evil eye.
