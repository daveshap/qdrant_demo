Is \"stew away\" a valid English expression? In a biographic interview with a person from the United States (New York resident and native US citizen) I hear the following: <blockquote>  So, I decided I can either stew away and feel sorry for myself for the rest of my life, or I can... </blockquote>I am not sure if I hear \"stew away\" correctly. If not, what could the proper reading be? Second, if \"stew away\" is anyway correct, what is the meaning? I do not find it in dictionaries. From context I imagine it should mean something like be angry, be filled with bad feelings, but do not do significant moves to change the situation. (Note: consider that I simply could have mis-heared this, or be sitting on my ears and not hear the obvious. The interviewee talks very quickly, and the interview was recorded via telephone. On the other hand, record quality is pretty good.)
