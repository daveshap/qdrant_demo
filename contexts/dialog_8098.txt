BYTES: You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
BOY: Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
BYTES: He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
BOY: He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
BYTES: If he does it's his own fault! But I'm not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
BOY: What are you going to do?
BYTES: I'll show you! I'll show you!
BOY: Don't!
BYTES: Shut up!
