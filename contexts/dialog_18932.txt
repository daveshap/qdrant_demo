VADA: Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
PHIL: I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
VADA: Maybe.
PHIL: Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
VADA: A secret, I like that.
PHIL: This is it I guess.
VADA: Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
PHIL: You want me to come with?
VADA: I should do this myself.
PHIL: Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
VADA: Okay.
