SHARON: How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
DULANEY: He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
SHARON: If he files are you going to take the case?
DULANEY: I don't know yet. I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
SHARON: What's she like?
DULANEY: Attractive. Bright. Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
SHARON: She sounds like quite a woman.
DULANEY: Yeah -- but can she cook?
