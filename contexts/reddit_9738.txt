Anyone with live-in experience?
Hi! 

I just wanted to reach out to see if anyone has had experience being a live-in professional staff member such as a residence life coordinator or director?  I have worked in higher education on the academic affairs side (admin, outreach, and advising) for over 5 years but I am currently applying to live-in residence positions with little knowledge of the field.  I would love to know more about what it was like to live on campus and ask questions if any of you have had a similar position! 

Thanks :)
