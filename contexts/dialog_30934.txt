JOHN: I cheated to get on the boat!!! All right?!
CHUCK: What?
JOHN: I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut. I'm a moron, okay? You satisfied?!
CHUCK: You're not a moron.
JOHN: Wanna bet? Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about. You know why it takes me so long to write papers? because I can't spell. While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
JOHN: Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
PHIL: I can show you how to use a slide rule.
ROBIN: How long you been standing there?
PHIL: Long enough.
JOHN: They were gonna put me into special- ed this year. I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding. I'll never pass the boards.
CHUCK: Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades. We'll start a private study group. Nobody knows. You'll ace that test.
