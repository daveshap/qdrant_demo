Going through hell atm
I am the worst I have ever been in a long time. My cat has been missing for almost 5 weeks and I feel dead inside. I dont know where he is, if he is alive. He was my best friend. on top of that I am already depressed. I don't even have enough energy to cry anymore.

I have cleaned my room, done a rerun of my favourite tv show, and I don't start school for a fortnight... my next psych appointment isn't for another 3 weeks.. and I don't have any friends to comfort me.

I feel like I am suffocating in despair, I don't want to be conscious. I have spent the whole of June sad and right now I'm so stressed I feel nauseated and panicky.

No idea how to calm down or numb the pain. :(
What in gods name can I do to feel okay, I am on the verge of a breakdown.
