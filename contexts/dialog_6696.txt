DANIEL: I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
BONANNO: I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
DANIEL: He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
BONANNO: I assume you want something?
DANIEL: We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
BONANNO: You want me to help you get out of the country?
BONANNO: And for my help I would get what?
DANIEL: Half the tapes.
BONANNO: And the other half?
DANIEL: I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
BONANNO: I only have your word for that.
DANIEL: I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
BONANNO: Where are you staying?
BONANNO: I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
DANIEL: How about if I call you?
