They’re not “that” busy.
I had to remind myself tonight that no one is truly *so* busy that they cannot make time for you. No matter what. 

I’ve been pursuing a girl for some time now, but I’m calling it quits. We had good chemistry, but I haven’t seen her in months. She makes excuses on every chance to get a drink, coffee, go out, etc. However, she goes out every weekend. There is no excuse you can make to make it seem like you are *that* busy. 

Don’t let someone have your time of day when they won’t even give you theirs. It’s not worth it. Cheers to you beautiful ladies and gents of Reddit. On to the next one
