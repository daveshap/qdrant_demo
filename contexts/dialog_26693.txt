HUNSECKER: If looks could kill, I'm dead...
STEVE: No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic. My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
HUNSECKER: And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately? Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
STEVE: Why? Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice? Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...? You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
HUNSECKER: Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns. So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
STEVE: But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
HUNSECKER: Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
