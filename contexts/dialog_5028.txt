BUFFY: How are you doing?
PIKE: Oh, I'm good. I'm good. Kind of miss my knees, though.
BUFFY: You want some water or something?
PIKE: Water. Okay.
PIKE: Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
BUFFY: Not exactly.
PIKE: They were vampires, weren't they?
BUFFY: Yeah.
PIKE: God! Unbelievable. Vampires.
BUFFY: You had a car full of stuff. Were you leaving?
PIKE: Yeah, I was bailing. I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess. Bad scene.
BUFFY: Well, stay here tonight.
PIKE: Thanks. Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus. I'm gone.
BUFFY: Where are you gonna go?
PIKE: Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
PIKE: Hey, jeez are you okay? You need a hand?
BUFFY: It's nothing. It doesn't hurt.
