LOUISE: Shit. I'm gettin' tired.
THELMA: Are you alright?
LOUISE: I think I've really fucked up. I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed. Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
THELMA: You know why. You already said.
LOUISE: What'd I say again?
THELMA: Nobody would believe us. We'd still get in trouble. We'd still have our lives ruined. And you know what else?
LOUISE: What?
THELMA: That guy was hurtin' me. And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse. And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night. And they woulda made out like I asked for it. And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now. At least now I'm havin' fun. And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me. And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise. Thank you for savin' my ass.
LOUISE: I said all that?
THELMA: No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
LOUISE: Whatever.
