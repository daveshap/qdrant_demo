I asked four of my friends about the worst moment from their alumni interviews.
We all fuck up in interviews.

I personally have a few moments that occasionally keep me up at night. Not just from college interviews – I'm a bungling buffoon during internship interviews, debate tournaments, and class presentations. I figure, though, that I can't be alone. Haven't we all experienced that one cringeworthy moment, that instance of instantaneous embarrassment we so zealously yearn to retract? If you answer "no," you're probably just not self-aware.

As such, I asked four of my friends about their interviews. Each of them are bright, talented, and entirely worthy applicants for their schools, but each can be a stumbling bastion of bumbling ineptitude at a moment's glance. Unsurprisingly, then, we all fucked up during our interviews. I rank them below in order of ascending stupidity.

**#4: Mixing up the Colleges** 

This guy's first choice was Duke, with Middlebury being a rather close second. These are, as y'all know, two very different schools with respect to location, athletics, and (especially) size. He had conducted due research on both, and emphasized components of each college which appealed to him. For Duke, he loved the large class size. For Middlebury, he loved the small class size.

The doofus forgot which college he was interviewing for. 

It went a little something like this –

**Doofus:** "Middlebury's large size deeply resonates with me. I enjoy having several opportunities available to me on campus, and socializing with new people each day. I think it'll be integral to my college experience, and Middlebury offers just that." 

**Interviewer:** "Middlebury, uh, Midd's class size is about 2,500–"

**Doofus:** "Exactly. But the breadth of opportunities available at Middlebury – their clubs, intramural and varsity sports, teacher-student interactions – makes it feel big. There's an opportunity for each student, the ability to explore several directions, hence why I say 'large size.'" 

Honestly a remarkable save, in my opinion. He remarked that the interviewer bought it too, as they began talking about which clubs interested him. He got deferred from Duke ED and is waiting on Middlebury RD. 

**#3 Just a Terrible Answer** 

Interviewing for Vanderbilt. She said her interview was going smoothly enough, nothing remarkable but hardly any mistakes. Their conversation was winding down and she was handling the stereotypical exit questions, principally "what do you look forward to doing the most at Vanderbilt?" 

What would you answer? Probably something safe like engaging in Vandy's education training program, relaxing in the library, seeing the first snowfall, etc. Not her, though, for she is a nincompoop.

**Interviewer:** What do you look forward to the most at Vanderbilt?

**Nincompoop:** Attending one of the frat parties, putting myself out there... Vanderbilt's party scene is a major selling point.

**Interviewer:** Oh –– I was looking for something academic, but that's a unique answer.

Not too bad, but certainly not the ideal way to end an interview. She got accepted into Vanderbilt, though, so I guess something clicked.

**#2 Really Weird Wording**

This friend has a particular penchant for writing. He's able to string words together eloquently and impactfully, in a way where he invokes emotion. Sometimes, though, he misuses words or inadvertently creates really fuckin' weird pictures, as he did during his Dartmouth interview.

He said it was going pretty well, they were conversing about teacher-student relationships and the importance of accessible professors. We all attend a pretty small and progressive school, and routinely consult our instructors outside of class. So this lummox says:

**Lummox:** Maintaining relationships with my instructors is just indispensable for college. I feel Dartmouth has that. At [high school]... we have deeply intimate relationships that extend beyond teacher and student.

**Interviewer, thinking:** *this guy's gonna fuck every professor at Dartmouth* 

Rejected from Dartmouth ED. Guess the fertility rate in New Hampshire's high enough already. 

**#1 Insulting your Fucking Interviewer** 

Williams College up in Massachusetts has a pretty good XC program, believe it or not. This friend is "the guy" on our cross-country and track team, and he was interviewing with some Williams alumni. They got to talking about the athletics program at Williams, namely the success that their XC team had this year (they made nationals, I believe). 

I should add that his interviewer was a rather large woman.

Everything was going smoothly, he says, until this dunce whips out this gem:

**Dunce:** Running's a major part of my day-to-day life. Practice starts at 4:00, and it usually takes two hours between running, stretching, and weight training. But I love it – the competition, the drive to better yourself – it's just something I need to continue in college.

**Interviewer:** That's refreshing to hear, having a passion and sticking to it. I personally don't run–

**Dunce, smiling cordially:** Yeah, I can tell 

**Interviewer:**

**Dunce:**

**Interviewer:**

**Dunce:** I am so, so sorry 

The conversation continued awkwardly thereafter, and neither side brought it up again. I asked him just what the fuck he was thinking, and he had nothing. 

He did not get into Williams.
