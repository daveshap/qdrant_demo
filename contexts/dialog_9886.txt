CLIFFORD: Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
FRANCES: I'm not!
CLIFFORD: You're afraid!
FRANCES: I'm not!
CLIFFORD: You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
FRANCES: God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
CLIFFORD: Good, good. Give them that.
FRANCES: What?
CLIFFORD: Madam...?
FRANCES: Thank you.
CLIFFORD: Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house... her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
FRANCES: Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
CLIFFORD: Okay, but come here first.
FRANCES: Huh.
CLIFFORD: Come here. I want to show you something.
LAWYER: And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
BEBE: I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
LAWYER: Excuse me, sir?
BEBE: I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
LAWYER: Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
BEBE: That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
LAWYER: Oh. I mean, good.
BEBE: I think it's time to take the gloves off. Get me some reporters. Particularly Louella Parsons!
