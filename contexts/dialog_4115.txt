ESCOBAR: So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
GEORGE: Actually, it was three.
ESCOBAR: The man who gives us the airplanes. The man from America. The mafia. Chicago. Boom boom. Hollywood. You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
GEORGE: It would be my pleasure.
ESCOBAR: Good. Very good. Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
ESCOBAR: The man in the garden. He was full of courage.
GEORGE: Un sapo?
ESCOBAR: Un rata - no good. But he could have run, fled the country. Gone to the policia. But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
GEORGE: Yes.
ESCOBAR: But, never mind. I am thinking we can do much together. This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business. To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem. And I don't like problems.
GEORGE: With all respect, Padrino. Diego is my partner. I do not do business without him.
ESCOBAR: I like you, George. You are loyal. That is good. That is rare. Maybe crazy. Yes. I can tell already. You are like me. I look at you and I see myself. It's in the eyes, no, George?
GEORGE: Yes, it is.
ESCOBAR: So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
GEORGE: Yes, sir. As much as you can give me.
ESCOBAR: As much as I can give you? Ha ha. Very good. I like that. Come, George. Let us drive. We have much to talk about.
ESCOBAR: I like to come up here. To make the decisions. To be one with nature.
GEORGE: It's beautiful.
ESCOBAR: People tell me that I am crazy. That my business will never work in your country. What do you think, George?
GEORGE: What do I think? I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
ESCOBAR: Yes. I do not know, either. What do you want, George?
GEORGE: I want money.
ESCOBAR: Yes. Money. Which is what, George?
GEORGE: Freedom.
ESCOBAR: Power?
GEORGE: Yeah, maybe.
ESCOBAR: Family.
GEORGE: Sure.
ESCOBAR: Beautiful girls?
GEORGE: Keep them coming.
ESCOBAR: Keep them coming? Ah, yes. Ha ha. You are right. But money.
GEORGE: Money.
ESCOBAR: And Diego?
GEORGE: Diego is my brother.
