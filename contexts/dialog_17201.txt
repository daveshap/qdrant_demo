VIRGINIA: Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
THOMAS: All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it. I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night. Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
VIRGINIA: Tommy...
THOMAS: I don't wanna talk about it!
THOMAS: I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
VIRGINIA: Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
THOMAS: Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
