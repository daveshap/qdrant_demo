How to cope with a breakup?
hi, first post! please be nice I'm baby.

anyway so my bf of 19 months (16m) just broke up with me (16n) and has taken my (previously our) whole friend group with him. 
i'm struggling to buckle down and focus on my classes (which require a lot of focused study) because i keep thinking about him and us and all my messy drama feelings. 

my family doesn't know I was even dating him, so I can't ask them for support. i have a couple online friends but I don't want to rely on them to be my whole support system. I'm in therapy, but i don't have another appointment until mid-January because of christmas etc.

I'm looking for no-bullshit advice to be able to just set aside all of my drama and concentrate on schoolwork, something I have a hard time doing normally let alone now (ADHD/autism/mental illness is fun). i really need to just focus on my classes for the next year and a half so I can get into a good college, and im struggling to support and motivate myself even with the knowledge that studying now will help me later, because what does it even matter if I'm completely alone? ugh, teenage drama.
 
anyway, anything helps. if you don't have any advice I will also accept fun science facts. biology-related facts preferred (it's my favorite)
