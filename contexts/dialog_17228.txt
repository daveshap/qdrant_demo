DUKE: You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.

HENRY: Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours. Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
HAWKEYE: About that chest-cutter...
HENRY: I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
HAWKEYE: We don't want any more than that. Right now.
