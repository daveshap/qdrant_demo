SF novel, starts w/ actor & widow meet timetraveling husband, there was a party, bankruptcy then scene set on the moon I havent finished this book. I forgot a lot about the specific details but I remembered how it started. A popular actor (?) went to this lady's house in a car and she was described like a widow. It was because his husband was timetravelling and can only show up on a specific date and time.  They meet the time traveling husband and turns out it\u2019s the last time he can show up. The husband told them something important.  I'm not sure what it was,  something weird like, the actor and his wife should end up together. The actor person went home, was distraught, had a luxurious party and woke up bankrupt.  There was a bit about some not human partners disguised as a couple who wanted to catch/kidnap someone. Then a scene on the moon.  A weird name and a punishment that amounts to forgetting something.
