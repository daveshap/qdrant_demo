Will workplaces start spying on us?
Based on the new normal for most office/corporate workers, do you guys know/think that HR or even managers will be able to remote view employees at any time?

Is there some sort of law or regulation preventing this?

Im kind of paranoid because I like to take long breaks and pretend im working..I still get everything done but idk..

Appreciate it

EDIT: What I mean is, do they care if we take long breaks?
