I deactivated my Facebook and my anxiety had decreased by so much!
The daily pressures of seeing everyone’s posts and keeping up on every ones lives. I’m over the drama. I feel great no longer having Facebook! I highly suggest taking a break from social media for a while if you’re feeling overwhelmed with life.
