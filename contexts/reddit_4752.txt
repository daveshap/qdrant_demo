No point on living like this anymore I can't stand loneliness anymore.
This is really ruining me. I hate myself for being the way I am. A shy introverted guy like myself has no future in this world full of predators ready to harm other in the pursue for success. I really wish I could change how I am, I'd really like to have that common thing wich is the ability to talk to other people and make friendships and getting good jobs and (hate to admit it) have a sex life, I don't even have a sex life, and maybe I shouldn't say that because that could get me labeled as  a creep but whatever, I'm already labeled like that by other people I guess, or maybe I'm just paranoid, I hope so.
Anyway that's the thing. I wish I could change it but honestly I don't want to get hurt in the process. Haha my god. Grow up kid!
