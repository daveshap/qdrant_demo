Breaking into an Academic Advising Career
Hi all, 

A little background about me.  I have a B.S. degree in Biological and Conservation and Environmental Sciences.  The past three years after college I have either spent unemployed, working for academic research centers, or working for municipalities doing environmental work.  After doing some reflecting, Im realizing that the science fields are too strict and impersonal for my taste.  I am considering doing a teaching residency, but I am not sure how I feel about working with children.  I would love to stay in Academia though, so Ive also been considering Academic Advising.  

I was hoping to get some insight on Academic Advising.  What are the main functions of the position? Does it require a Masters Degree, and if so, why?  I have read that people have a better chance of working their way into an Academic Advising role by starting off as an admin assistant at a college and just getting to know people.  Ive also read that Academic Advising is flooded with people with PhDs that didnt make it in their respective field and effectively block anyone else from entering the field.  

Through my past jobs I got some exposure to interacting with clients (supervisor event production job in college) and some PR work (showing investors, future students, and visiting professors around our research facility), so I feel that I could effectively communicate with students about colleges and the paths they can take, especially if its in the sciences.
