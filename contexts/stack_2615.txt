Keeping raster table values in new vector file in ArcMap? I have calculated the time cost of a series of paths from prehistoric sites to their nearest water sources using the cost path tool.I now want to convert the raster outputs I created to a vector polyline, but when I do, the new vector table doesn't keep the \"PATHCOST\" raster values and I am left only with the shape length.I could copy the data I need manually, but I would have to do this hundred's of times. How can I do this Automatically?
