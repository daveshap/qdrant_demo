DR. MAXWELL: Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
BETSY: I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
RAND: We're all in it. There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use. Say something, Paul! You've always been good with words. Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
MRS. RAND: You're wrong, Wesley. The guilt is mine -- all of it.
RAND: Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
MRS. RAND: Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort. Tell them what you saw there.
BETSY: Mrs. Rand...
MRS. RAND: You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
BETSY: Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night. But there's nothing wrong with that. She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people, to help them.
