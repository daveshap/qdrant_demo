HAROLD: It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
BEN: Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
HAROLD: It was all junk!
BEN: Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
HAROLD: Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
BEN: What?
HAROLD: Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
BEN: That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
HAROLD: I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
