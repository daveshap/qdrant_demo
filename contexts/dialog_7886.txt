ED: Bela, what happened?!
BELA: I didn't feel well...
ED: Let me take you to the hospital.
BELA: No hospital. Just take me to the couch...
ED: Should I call a doctor?
BELA: Nah. This happens all the time...
ED: Is there anything I can get you? Water? A blanket?
BELA: Goulash.
ED: I don't know how to make goulash.
ED: What's in the needle?
BELA: Morphine, with a demerol chaser. Eddie, I'm so broke. I don't know what I'm gonna do...
ED: Don't worry. I'll do something.
ED: I'm no good.
DOLORES: Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
ED: Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going... But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
DOLORES: That's ridiculous.
ED: All I wanna do is tell stories. The things I find interesting...
DOLORES: Well maybe you're not studio kind of material. Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
