LOOMIS: I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
BRACKETT: Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
LOOMIS: I am. I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
BRACKETT: What do we do?
LOOMIS: He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
BRACKETT: I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
LOOMIS: If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
BRACKETT: I'll check back in an hour.
LAURIE: ...how now
TOMMY: I don't like that story.
LAURIE: But king Arthur was always your favorite.
TOMMY: Not any more.
LAURIE: Why are they under there?
TOMMY: Mom doesn't like me to have them.
LAURIE: 'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
TOMMY: Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
