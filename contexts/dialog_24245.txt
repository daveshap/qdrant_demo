WOOLRIDGE: You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
MARSHA: I knew he slept in a toolshed.
WOOLRIDGE: His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
MARSHA: Before they were married?
WOOLRIDGE: I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin."
MARSHA: That's really strange. What does it mean?
WOOLRIDGE: One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
