Can someone report you to the police for an online argument. Details below:
So basically I was arguing with a random person on the internet about politics. I had messaged her first after she had put something on her story about a political party and I disagreed. We argued for sometime after she continuously insulted me and questioned my mental state. I on the other hand kept to the argument and never personally insulted her. Later on when she was loosing the agreement she said I was harassing her and asked how? She then told me to leave her alone and I asked how? She then told me to leave her alone and I replied ok sorry you felt that way. The last message she sent was her saying I am reporting you to the police for harassment. I am now shit scared and worried if she can take it to the police. I doubt she can as I feel like iâ€™ve done nothing wrong but some assurance would be nice. I live in the Uk as well.
