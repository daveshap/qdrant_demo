Need Help Developing a “Analytical” Research Question for my exit paper.
Hey, I am desperate and need some help/ feedback. I am on the verge of completing my Masters in Educational Leadership and need to write an exit paper. The main topic that I am looking at is the Achievement Gap that exist between student, however I am having a difficult time forming a question around that topic that doesn’t turn into a descriptive paper. 

Another top that I was interested in was focused on teacher perceptions and it affect a academic outcomes. 

Any advice would be welcomed.
