How much did you have saved for grad school?
I got accepted to my top grad school in the Spring! I deferred my acceptance for a year solely to save money. I’m starting in Fall 2020 now and I’m obsessing over nickel and diming everything I do. By the time I move I will probably have anywhere from 10-15k saved but I feel like it’s not enough. Mostly I think I need a little validation. I’ll have to pay for tuition as well as housing... moving costs to a new state... it’s a lot to think about. 

How much did you save before grad school? Was it enough? How much do you wish you saved? Etc etc.
