What are some behind-the-scene jobs in the entertainment industry?
I'm writing this for a friend of mine. She's been struggling to find her path in life, bouncing around from one idea to another.

She has an amazing voice, great personality, fantastic storyteller, and comedian! Maybe I'm biased. She's expressed that she's always wanted to get into the entertainment industry, but has lacked the confidence to pursuit it.

She would never post on Reddit, but I wanted to see if I could gather some interesting career paths in the entertainment industry for her.
