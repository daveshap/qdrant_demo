Are the resignations of State Department officials under Trump normal for a Presidential transition?
I just saw this pop up on my Facebook timeline.

The post brings up that they served both Republicans and Democrats. That leads me to believe these types of resignations are abnormal during a transition,  but are they? I assume with major shifts in ideologies that mass resignations in government departments would be normal. Does anyone know if there have been more resignations under Trump than with prior Presidents not just limited to the State Department?
