DR. MANHATTAN: I'm not here. I'm still on Mars. I've come to collect you.
LAURIE: Collect me?
DR. MANHATTAN: In the immediate future we're on Mars. I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
LAURIE: Jon, no -- I can't --
DR. MANHATTAN: It will happen, Laurie. I've already seen it. Neither of us can do anything to change it.
