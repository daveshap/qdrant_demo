REILLY: So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
RICE: Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
REILLY: You don't fish.
RICE: How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
REILLY: You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
RICE: One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
REILLY: No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
RICE: Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
REILLY: What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
RICE: I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
REILLY: She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
RICE: What was it this time?
REILLY: She wanted to cook me breakfast.
RICE: We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
REILLY: Nah, let's just take a look-see.
