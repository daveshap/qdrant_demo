SAM: Have you seen my wallet?
JONAH: It might be in the kitchen.
SAM: I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here. You'll have a swell time. You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
JONAH: Are you going with her?
SAM: Yes.
SAM: I have to have a life. I have to do things that I want with people my own age. It's none of your business who I am going out with. I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
JONAH: This is the one I like.
