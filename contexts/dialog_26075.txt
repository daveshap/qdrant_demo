MAX: Picture it... I feel like I gotta share this with somebody. It's too perfect.
LENNY: I won't say anything.
MAX: I know. So, I'm working for this puke, right? And he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker. But also I gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control.
MAX: Only he doesn't know about me and Faith. So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else. And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase. So to buy time, I do the skank. I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall. And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
LENNY: And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
MAX: No plan is perfect, Lenny. Hey, cheer up. World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
LENNY: You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
MAX: You got froggy on me a couple times.
