GRAHAM: Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
MORGAN: Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
MERRILL: I'm sorry, what book is this?
GRAHAM: Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
MORGAN: They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
GRAHAM: What's two?
MORGAN: They win.
GRAHAM: What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
MORGAN: Sounds made up.
