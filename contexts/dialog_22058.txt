JACK BANGS: There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
YOUNG GOVERNOR: We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
JACK BANGS: Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
YOUNG GOVERNOR: We're aware of your position.
JACK BANGS: Because down there this is money. Up here this is heat. You wanted Vegas quality, I brought it to you. You wanted Vegas press, I gave it to you. But guys, please, guys... I can't get you Vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
