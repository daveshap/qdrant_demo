PENELOPE: And this is my son, Paul. He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
PAUL: He's coming back, Mom! He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
PENELOPE: I told you this was a simple-minded play.
PAUL: Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
PENELOPE: I know.
PAUL: Stay home tonight!
PENELOPE: Oh, Paul--
PAUL: You're married! You've already got a husband!
PENELOPE: He's a ghost!
PAUL: He's alive!
PENELOPE: Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
PAUL: If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad? Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
PENELOPE: Thank you, kind sir.
PAUL: A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
PENELOPE: A what kind of doctor?
PAUL: A fairy--a queer. Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
PENELOPE: That's an interesting piece of news.
PAUL: You're the only woman he ever took out.
PENELOPE: Not true.
PAUL: Still lives with his mother.
PENELOPE: You know she has no feet! You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
PAUL: How did she lose her feet?
PENELOPE: In a railroad accident many years ago.
PAUL: I was afraid to ask.
PENELOPE: Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose. As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
PAUL: I didn't know that.
PENELOPE: A lot of people don't.
PAUL: J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
PENELOPE: I don't really know.
PAUL: To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign. Peace. Peace. Peace, everybody.
PENELOPE: I hate that thing.
PAUL: It's beautiful.
WOODLY: Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
PAUL: You're taking Mom out tonight?
WOODLY: You're going out?
PENELOPE: Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
WOODLY: Take plenty of cigars.
PENELOPE: We made the date three months ago.
WOODLY: I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun. I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
PENELOPE: She quit this afternoon.
PAUL: We don't have a maid any more.
WOODLY: Oh?
PENELOPE: The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
WOODLY: I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry. I don't cry, of course. Not manly, you know. Did she try antihistamines?
PENELOPE: They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
WOODLY: Throw out all this junk. Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
PAUL: Everything stays as it is!
WOODLY: A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
PAUL: My father!
WOODLY: I apologize. But you didn't know him, and neither did I. How's your asthma?
PAUL: Don't worry about it.
WOODLY: How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
PAUL: It's fine!
WOODLY: It's jungle rot! This room is making everybody sick! This is your family doctor speaking now. Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
PENELOPE: War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely."
WOODLY: No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
WOODLY: I hate that thing.
PAUL: Keeps fairies away!
SHUTTLE: Hi kid. Would you look what the car dragged in.
WOODLY: I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
SHUTTLE: Is that a fact?
WOODLY: That maid just quit. The place is a mess. You can start in the master bedroom.
PENELOPE: Please--
SHUTTLE: He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
PENELOPE: I'll get ready, Herb. I didn't expect you this soon. Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
