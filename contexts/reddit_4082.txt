Victory in a grocery store and a date the same night
(31 F). Did my typical grocery shopping on the weekend. I needed a new pillow, so I was looking around and ran into a guy. He asked me questions about memory foam and air mattresses. He was going on a trip with some friends. 

I made conversation and kind of threw out a vague “Oh are you going with your wife/gf?” Since he was older he caught on to what I was doing. He asked me why I asked. I told him he was attractive. I didn’t expect him to ask for my number immediately after. Never in my life has this ever happened. I feel very proud of myself. 

Not going to lie I was a bit nervous as I just met him and didn’t know much. We ended up going on a nice date to get some food and go see a movie. He touched me the majority of the movie. It felt so nice to actually have affection. (My last relationship had no affection and was very verbally abusive) 

We ended up kissing at the end of the night. I text him as a courtesy to let him know I had a good time and to give him a compliment. He did text back. I’m not going to read to much into this as I know how dating is now. 

We both aren’t seeking a relationship, but I do eventually want one just not anytime soon. 

Regardless of the outcome I’m very happy it happened. (I’m a pretty positive person, but my assumptions will always go to “Yeah that’s gonna be it.”) 

I’m trying my best to play it kool and not stress if I don’t hear from him at all, but I don’t want to come off as uninterested. Should I just lay low and not text anymore until I hear something? 

Another thing ladies. Just go for it. If you get rejected oh well. Or you might be surprised. After years of off and on OLD I told myself I would never do it again. I’m glad I stuck to it. 

Edit-Thanks for gold! You guys are awesome. Love ya all! ❤️

Update 1-He never texted today. :( It’s all good though! Small victories and just means I’m capable of doing something like that again. :) will update if it changes.
