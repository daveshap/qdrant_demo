Today is a really, really, really, hard, no good, bad day.
And, like GAD always is, I have no fucking reason to feel so guilty and scared. I just do. I hate this sensation. I'm hoping to lose myself in work and exercise today so I can just go to sleep again once the day is over. 

I'm thinking of everyone who struggles with this sensation like me, and I'm giving you all a huge hug. I just keep repeating that I/we're gonna get through it, and it's all going to be ok.
