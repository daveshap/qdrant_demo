I've been reading this sub for the pass 4 hours, and think I don't want to kill myself anymore.
I might be a waste of space and money to everyone I love

But I feel , I don't want to kill myself about it.

 I think tomorrow, I will try to work on it, and hopefully,become something worth loving again : )

Edited: 

I really appreciate your kind comments, but today was another awful day.

A lot of you asked me  to talk about it, so here is more background

 I have to admit, I don't have the courage to kill myself, but I am still hating every minute my life now

My problem is simple. I am sick , not my body , but my mind. I can't fix it, my psychiatrist can't fix it, my psychologist can't fix it. Meds can't fix it neither.

I don't know what to do, I feel like I am impresioned in my own body. This is slowly killing everything nice I had in my life. 

I know you will say, *it's only your mind you can fix it!*. But I am being In this for 10 painful years and there is little to no improvement. Just pain, day after day

Every day , I have to look to ones I love and feel the disappointment. The rage, the sadness of my condition. Today, the same happened , the same way it happened day after day for a decade.

I don't know what to do. I would give everything to be okey again. There would be no price I would not pay, but I feel there is no real solution to my condition than an slow and solitary death
