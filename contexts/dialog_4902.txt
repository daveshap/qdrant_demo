TOM: Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
JANE: Okay. You didn't like the party, huh?
TOM: Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
TOM: I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
JANE: Eventually. Does it have to be right now?
TOM: Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
JANE: What?
TOM: I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
JANE: Well, what is it?
TOM: If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
JANE: Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
