DAVID: Wow ... That's pretty good ...
MR. JOHNSON: Thanks. But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment
MR. JOHNSON: Well don't you?
DAVID: I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
MR. JOHNSON: Really?
DAVID: Yeah.
MR. JOHNSON: Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
