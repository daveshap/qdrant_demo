ALICE: Where are you going?
MARK: I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
YVONNE: You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby?
ALICE: I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
YVONNE: Oh, Alice...no. Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
ALICE: Mark knows I'm not crazy. Ask him to show you his hands.
YVONNE: I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
ALICE: I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
