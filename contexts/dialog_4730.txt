LONGSHANKS: Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
EDWARD: The Scots will fight for us?
LONGSHANKS: What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
EDWARD: But if we have not caught Wallace --
LONGSHANKS: He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
LEPER: I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
ROBERT: He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
LEPER: So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
ROBERT: He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
LEPER: We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
ROBERT: In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
LEPER: All men lose heart. All betray. It is exactly why we must make the choices we make.
