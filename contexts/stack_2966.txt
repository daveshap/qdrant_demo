What part of special relativity is factored in in relativistic redshift velocity equations? While doing research into redshift equations (doppler redshift and cosmological redshift), both types of redshift had two equations for finding recession velocity: a 'non-relativistic' equation and a 'relativistic' equation. I looked up SR, and found out about time dilation and length contraction. My question is which of these phenomena have been factored in in relativistic equations (maybe both, or possibly a third phenomena I'm unaware of?)I'm doing this for a high school project, so please explain in very simplistic language. Also showing a bunch of complicated equations will seriously fly right over my head, so I'd greatly appreciate it if you could please use words only :)
