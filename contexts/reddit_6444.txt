Is it weird to contact a company you're interested in even if they aren't hiring?
Hello,

I have an odd question. A friend pointed me in the direction of an interesting company that relates to my background experience. They do not appear to have any jobs available or any "careers" link on their main website. Would it be inappropriate to reach out to them via the email they provide in the "contact us" section to see if I can get information about their hiring practices or if they hire during certain times of the year, etc.?
