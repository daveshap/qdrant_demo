CICI: Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I thought you were someone else.
MAN'S VOICE: That's okay.
CICI: Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
MAN'S VOICE: Where is everybody?
CICI: We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
MAN'S VOICE: Why aren't you there?
CICI: I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
MAN'S VOICE: That's too bad.
CICI: Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?"
MAN'S VOICE: What if I said you?
CICI: What if I said goodbye?
MAN'S VOICE: Why would you wanna do that?
CICI: Why do you always answer a question with a question?
MAN'S VOICE: I'm inquisitive.
CICI: I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
