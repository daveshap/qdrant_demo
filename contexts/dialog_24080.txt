CHRISTY: It's contraband. Don't ask. But I wanted to give you a treat. A sort of... thank-you gift.
MARY ROBERT: A thank-you? For what? You're the one we should be thanking.
MARY LAZARUS: Is there any syrup?
CHRISTY: Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular. I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful. Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
MARY ROBERT: Mary Clarence, don't be silly. You're an example to us all. You've taught us so much. We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows? Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
MARY PATRICK: Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
MARY LAZARUS: We could cut a demo. Look for a label.
CHRISTY: That's true, wouldn't that be great. Of course, we never know when things are going to change. Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
MARY ROBERT: Are you leaving us?
CHRISTY: Oh no. We'll always be together.
