Is it normal to not receive a raise after 10 years when your salary is the industry average?
My mother is an RN in the private sector as a home nurse. She started with the company in 2010 at $30 an hour. It's been 10 years and they never offered her a raise. Not once. Nothing. She recently asked for a raise and they offered her a measly dollar. The problem is wages in the private sector are right around $25-$30 an hour for my state. She's definitely in the top 20% of salary earners but it's pretty demoralizing knowing you're making less money than you were 10 years ago when you adjust for inflation.

How do companies go about handling raises for tenured employees? After all if they can get a young RN and pay them $25 an hour why would they want to pay my aging mother anything more than $30? Is this a problem with the company or just the economy in general? I feel like going 10 years without even a small raise to compensate for inflation is just god awful for a company to do to an employee.

Should she try to find another job or just stay put? Obviously wages have to get raised eventually. She shouldn't be making $30 in 2010 and then $31 in 2020 and $32 in 2030. Somethings got to give, right?
