Introducing new flair!
We're introducing a new flair, "PM me!", available to anyone who wishes to indicate that users can privately message you about problems, concerns, or even just to talk. It's a different sort of idea that we'd love to see expanded, so feel free to comment with suggestions for this (or other) flair templates that you'd like to see added. Thanks!  
**Edit: Due to the positive response, I've made it public! Look under the "X users, Y talking it out now" display in the sidebar and add that flair!**
