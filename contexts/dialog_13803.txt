LOWELL: ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
RICHARD SCRUGGS: That's right...
LOWELL: Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
RICHARD SCRUGGS: What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
LOWELL: Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
