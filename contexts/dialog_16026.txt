CLAUDE: For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
DAISY: Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
CLAUDE: Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
CLAUDE: Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line. What's wrong, baby?
DAISY: I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
CLAUDE: Engagement ring!
DAISY: That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
CLAUDE: Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
