ROY: Lucky? You call that lucky?
LILLY: He let me live. He let me be his friend.
ROY: You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
LILLY: You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
ROY: I tripped over a chair.
LILLY: Get off the grift, Roy.
ROY: Why?
LILLY: You don't have the stomach for it.
LILLY: I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
ROY: That's right.
