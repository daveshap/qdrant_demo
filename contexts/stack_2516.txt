Joining table of single house layer to zone layer by location using ArcGIS Pro? I have a layer which shows all the single house polygon. I also have a zone layer which shows the boundary of different regions.I would like to see which region each single house polygon is in, like having a field in single house polygon attribute table, stating which region does it fall to.If the polygon falls under 2 regions' boundaries, i want it to belong in the region with the larger section of the house polygon.Tried spatial join however there are no matching fields to do so
