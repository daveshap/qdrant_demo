How do large organisations manage access for their Instagram account? A platform like Facebook has fairly standard access management for Facebook pages - where multiple individual user accounts can be assigned to roles with varying privileges on the Facebook page, and the person(s) with the admin role can revoke those privileges. Instagram on the otherhand, has a strict one username/one password access model. Where content management can be abstracted using a tool like Buffer or Hootsuite (which allows content to be scheduled and queued via a desktop browser application), in order for someone to actually post to Instagram they need to use their phone, with the single username and password, to post the content.This seems sketchy - a large organisation that is perhaps providing customer service via their instagram account, would need multiple people having access, and there's what to do when someone gets sick etc. But if they all share the password - it seems a recipe for being locked out of your account, an employee going rogue etc. Is there any literature around how large companies are dealing with this currently? It seems that Instagram just doesn't lend itself to use by an organisation - and I'm wondering how organisations deal with this.
