My job stated they're signing us all up for enemployment. Should I go ahead and sign myself up anyway?
My job as moved to partial hours. I went from 40 hours per week to 16. They stated they will sign us all up for unemployment, and will have more information for us later. My question is, should I still sign myself up for unemployment as well? What will happen if I'm approved for both?
