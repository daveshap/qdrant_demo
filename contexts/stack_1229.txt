How to Use OPENROWSET function within a Transactional SSIS Package I have an SSIS Package and one of its components is \"Execute SQL TasK\"and I've written an OPNEROWSET query inside this task.  When I configure the transaction option of the whole package from \"Supported\" to \"Required\" I receive this error:<blockquote>  The requested operation could not be performed because OLE DB provider \"Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0\" for linked server \"(null)\" does not support the required transaction interface.</blockquote>When you want to configure the Transaction in SSIS you have to run the service\"Distributed Transaction coordinator\" and it seems that this service is in conflict with openrowset. What should I do?  Has anybody come across this issue?
