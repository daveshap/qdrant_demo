GRAHAM: ...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
MOLLY: You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us. And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay... He's after you now, isn't he?
GRAHAM: It's a precaution... Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
KEVIN: I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
GRAHAM: What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?' He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
MOLLY: He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
GRAHAM: Good for him. Thanks a lot, Freddie! Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
KEVIN: Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
GRAHAM: No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are.
KEVIN: Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
GRAHAM: Yes.
KEVIN: I figured I'd ask you...
GRAHAM: I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
KEVIN: I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it. This guy wants to kill you?
GRAHAM: We don't know that.
KEVIN: Are you gonna kill him?
GRAHAM: No. It's just my job to find him. I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
KEVIN: How did it happen?
GRAHAM: Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
KEVIN: How?
GRAHAM: With a knife. I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar. I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying. I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
KEVIN: You went in the apartment?
GRAHAM: Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
