First Debate Fact-Checking Thread
Hello and welcome to our first ever debate fact-checking thread!

We announced this [a few days ago,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/548hi7/announcing_our_debate_factchecking_initiative/) but here are the basics of how this will work:

* **Mods will post top level comments with quotes from the debate.**

This job is exclusively reserved to NP moderators.  We're doing this to avoid duplication and to keep the thread clean from off-topic commentary.  Automoderator will be removing all top level comments from non-mods.



* **You (our users) will reply to the quotes from the candidates with fact checks.**

All replies to candidate quotes must contain a link to a source which confirms or rebuts what the candidate says, and must also explain why what the candidate said is true or false.

Fact checking replies without a link to a source will be summarily removed. No exceptions.

* **Discussion of the fact check comments can take place in third-level and higher comments**

Normal NeutralPolitics rules still apply.
