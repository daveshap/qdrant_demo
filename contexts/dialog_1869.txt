KIRKEBY: -- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
DOBISCH: Who?
KIRKEBY: Kubelik.
DOBISCH: No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
KIRKEBY: Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
DOBISCH: A.W.O.L.?
KIRKEBY: What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
