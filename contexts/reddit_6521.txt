Why do companies use staffing agencies to hire permanent full-time workers?
Question as stated, what is the average amount a company pays a staffing agency in the event a candidate is hired, on top of whatever the candidate gets paid?

Just sorta seems to me that companies only 'see' candidates from staffing agencies as a method of getting a run of the field for people to interview, so they can severely lowball on salary for those not going through agencies...But I'm likely wrong here in some fashion.

Context : I'm going through a staffing agency for a coordinator position, company doesn't seem THAT large that they'd be particularly interested in paying salary + whatever cut the agency gets on top of that. I'm not taking it especially seriously, though - I've got other stuff going.
