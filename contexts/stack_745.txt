Laptop with external HDMI monitor: screen off/on loop I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 on my laptop, and I have an external monitor connected via HDMI. Normally, my screen turns off after 10 minutes of inactivity or after I lock the screen. This sets off a series of events:The laptop screen turns off.The external monitor goes to sleep.Ubuntu seems to think the external monitor has been detached, and it refreshes the display.My laptop screen turns back on, in single display mode.The external monitor turns back on, and the display refreshes again to dual display mode.After a period of inactivity, repeat from #1.This happens over and over again indefinitely, preventing both displays from ever turning off. Since I rely on this feature to automatically lock my computer after inactivity, it's also a security concern.Is there any way to prevent this problem?
