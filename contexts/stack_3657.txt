Can using torrent help me obfuscate Tor-over-VPN traffic? There is tremendous misinformation about Tor in my country's mainstream media so, even though i use Tor for everyday surfing, I'd like to hide it from my ISP.Currently, I use a VPN whenever I am online, tunneling also other traffic such as torrents.I am in a 14-eyes country, but my VPN server is not.I know that using a VPN I should be covered, but I fear that this could not be enough.Here is my question: If I generate heavy loads of traffic with p2p protocols (e.g. torrent) while I am surfing with Tor-browser, everything over the same VPN, can it gives me privacy benefits?In other words, will my ISP have to try harder in order to discover that I am using Tor?
