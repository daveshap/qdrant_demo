I want to see my infant son
Hey reddit,  I have a son who is just over a year old.  I have only met him once when he was 3 months old,  his mother hates me,  has blocked all ways of communications,  sued me (and won) for child support, Not that I mind I'm more than happy to support my son.  She won't let me see him,  I live 7 hours away and all I want to do is see my baby boy I love him so much it breaks my heart,  I'm ignoring all grammar rules right now that's how much I don't care I just want my son I could cry. I took a loan for thousands of dollars and hired a lawyer,  I sued for basically joint custody or visitation,  pretty much whatever I could get,  she in turn counter sued me for full custody,  claiming I'm unfit to be a father,  that fucking heartless bitch how dare she.  Tears roll down my cheeks as I type this reddit. I just want my son. After she counter sued I haven't heard anything back from my lawyer,  it's been a couple weeks,  never been more heartbroken in my life.
