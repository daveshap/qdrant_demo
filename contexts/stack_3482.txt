Any Alternative to Ngrok for constant Connection? Im trying to build RAT to test on my computer. I use ngrok for hacking on WAN. But ngrok has a problem of changing its subdomain once the connection is reset. So, I cant use ngrok for hacking over WAN. I tried using ngrok sub-domain, but now it has become a premium plan. Please suggest me some alternatives for ngrok which will provide me constant subdomain even if the connection is reset. Also, suggest if there are any other methods for hacking over WAN other than SSH Tunneling, Using VPN and port forwarding.
