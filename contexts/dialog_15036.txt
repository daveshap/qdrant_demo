NICK: That little black line?
SARAH: That little black line means death for this infant. The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet. The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
MALCOLM: Can you set up?
SARAH: It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
MALCOLM: Think fast, Sarah.
