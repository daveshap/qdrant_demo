I felt apart in front of her
We had such a great time in bed, just hanging around laughing and watching a movie. In one moment I just felt apart for no reason, I crashed, I felt so broken and started crying while hugging. I asked her if she could just hold me tight, as tight as she can and she did that. She said I love you.

For the first time in my life I felt safe while having a breakdown, all I did earlier was just getting shit for being such a crybaby.

I've never felt that much support and we've been together only for about 3 weeks, but when I'm with her I feel safe mentally, I feel like pieces of me are coming back together.
