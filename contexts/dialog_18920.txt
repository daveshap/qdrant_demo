VADA: Right.
NICK: And you'd be my cousin?
VADA: Yeah I guess...sort of.
NICK: But we wouldn't really be related right?
VADA: Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
NICK: Good. I mean...
VADA: Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
NICK: I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
