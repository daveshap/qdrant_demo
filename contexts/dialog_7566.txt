TARYN: <i>The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT </b> LOCUS FENDER is behind the wheel of the armored car. His unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.
TARYN: Where is the money?
DOMINO: I don't know.
TARYN: I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
DOMINO: You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.
TARYN: Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
DOMINO: Yes.
TARYN: You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
DOMINO: He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
