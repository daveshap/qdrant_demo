NICK: You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
JOYCE: Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
NICK: I need your help, Joyce.
JOYCE: Where's Ich?
NICK: Unavailable.
JOYCE: I've heard of Sugai. I've also heard of the emperor. They're both national treasures. One's a hood.
NICK: I need someone to translate for me.
JOYCE: My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
NICK: It's my last shot. I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
JOYCE: And I'm supposed to care?
NICK: You could fake it.
JOYCE: You're wrong to sell Ich short.
NICK: He drinks.
JOYCE: He's got a reason.
