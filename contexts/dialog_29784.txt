ELLIOT: What?
CLARENCE: Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
ELLIOT: No. No, you don't.
CLARENCE: Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
DICK: Clarence...
CLARENCE: Let me handle this.
ELLIOT: Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
CLARENCE: Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
