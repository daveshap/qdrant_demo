I need some advice
Yesterday i bunked school cause i did not study for an exam which was optional but my mother forced me to take it so i went to the park nearby and then today she found out so she completely insulted me calling me a fucktard and then she said she would kill herself and then said if someone with fape me and then said i dont need university and i should stay locked up in my room cause she dosent trust or love me anymore and called me an asshole and a fucking moron and this time she started hitting herself in front of me and this isnt the first she sweared at me she started swearing at me since i was 12 when i got a B in physics she also publicly humiliates me and on the other hand my dad is not saying anything acting like he us cool and says that im hopeless and i should just get married after school. My mom said i should just crush my life cause i dont have one now and so my depreesion has just added on as i kept enduring her harsh words where at this time i dont care what happens to me anymore. And the worst part is that my final exams are no less than 10 days and i have just given up in life now just like my parents did but u really am passionate of getting into a good university and becoming a successful architect but i dont know anymore sometimes my parents make me feel that i was a mistake the only reason for my happiness is my grandmother so i just keep crying in my room in the dark and now i really dont care what happens to me
