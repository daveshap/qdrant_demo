Should I leave this world?
My friends, my family, even my sister can't understand me. They made fun of me but didn't even know how much it hurts me (such as my study results, my hobby, my looks, etc). You can say they don't care about me, it's not wrong. Am I worth living in this life or I should end these long depressed days?
