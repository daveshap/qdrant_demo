Who has social anxiety or panic disorder but seems completely normal on the outside?
I Have a bit of social anxiety at certain times and my panic disorder comes on every so often as well. But from the outside I seem completely normal even like mid panic attack. Iâ€™m just curious to know how many other people I interact with on a daily basis that are working and living and doing things but still struggling immensely with anxiety ?
