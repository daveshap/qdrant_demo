GEORGE: We're all dying from the start. I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
SAM: You lied to me!
GEORGE: I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
SAM: This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here? Trying to get me to like you.
GEORGE: I never tried to get you to like me. I tried to get you to love me.
SAM: Well, congratulations! You fucking pulled it off!
SAM: Is Alyssa here?
COLLEEN: It's midnight. What's the matter, Sam?
SAM: Nothing. My dad's dying. I really need to talk to Alyssa.
