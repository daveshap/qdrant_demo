How to calculate secondary RMS current of each winding in multiplre output flyback converter? As I am designing multiple output flyback converter and I have confusion in selection of wire gauge of the secondary winding. There are 4 secondary windings and one bias winding. Mode of operation is CCM. V_out1  48  VI_out1  1.5 AV_out2  48  VI_out2  0.15AV_out3  25  VI_out3  0.7 AV_out4  25  VI_out4  0.3 AV_bias  16  VI_bias  0.05    A280 V dc input voltage. D_max=0.47, Lprimary=3.1mH, Fsw=65KHz
