VALENTINE: Adhara. I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
ADHARA: I used to hate it. Now I like it.
VALENTINE: Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
VALENTINE: Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
ADHARA: I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
VALENTINE: Gordon? He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
ADHARA: Then what good is he?
VALENTINE: Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
ADHARA: Is that a problem?
VALENTINE: Not for you, clearly.
ADHARA: I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
VALENTINE: Am I a thing?
ADHARA: Well, you're certainly not a person.
VALENTINE: I'm not.
ADHARA: No. You're not specific enough to be a person. You're more like a vibe.
VALENTINE: I'm so glad we're having this chat.
ADHARA: It's not a knock.
VALENTINE: It's not a compliment.
ADHARA: It's an observation. Like: I'm hungry. When are we eating?
VALENTINE: As soon as you get dressed.
ADHARA: What kind of food?
VALENTINE: Anything but Japanese.
ADHARA: Why?
VALENTINE: I'm not into finger foods. Too fussy.
ADHARA: Like you.
VALENTINE: I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets. Salad bars.
ADHARA: You demand to be served. A fork fetishist.
VALENTINE: It's just fuel to me. I'm not there for distractions.
ADHARA: For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
VALENTINE: That's what Gordon's always saying.
ADHARA: Oh, god.
