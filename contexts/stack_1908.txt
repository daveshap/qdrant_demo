Is \"propped up\" an adjective or a past participle? I am analyzing the past tense of \"simple past\" and I do not know if the form \"were propped up\" indicated in the sentence is composed of a verb conjugated in \"simple past\" and followed by an adjective, or on the contrary, it is part of a clause in passive.Her flat cloth slippers were propped up on a foot-warmer, and a cat reposed on her lap.
