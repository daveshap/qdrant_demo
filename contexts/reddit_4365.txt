Happy Valentines Day for all of those in struggle or are lonely.
Even though I have never had a girlfriend (mostly because how fucking weird/strange I am), I wanted to share the love this year. 

For all of those who are in the struggle together, or are very lonely, I wish you a happy Valentines Day, and I wish the best of all of you guys. May you find true love.

I always try to remind myself that nothing is certain, everything can and will change (for better or worse), which means appreciate the moment for what you have, and don't lose hope for what you want or need.
