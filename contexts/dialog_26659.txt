SIDNEY: You print them, don't you?
HUNSECKER: Yes, with your clients' names attached. That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world! Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
SIDNEY: I didn't say that, J.J.
HUNSECKER: The day that I can't get along without press agents' handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.
