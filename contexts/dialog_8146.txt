BUD: What's through here?
MRS. LEFFERTS: No! Please leave!
MRS. LEFFERTS: Don't mind the smell. I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
BUD: Easy. Tell me about the ruckus.
MRS. LEFFERTS: I came home that night and there was blood on the floor. Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself. They were acting nervous. And that Stens kept going under the house.
