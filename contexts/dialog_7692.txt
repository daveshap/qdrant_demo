GLADYS: ...Today's To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --"
IRIS: Nothin' too showy!
GLADYS: Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
IRIS: Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
GLADYS: Oh, my! Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
GLADYS: Iris, stop! It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
IRIS: That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
IRIS: Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
GLADYS: You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
IRIS: It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
GLADYS: I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
IRIS: All right, let's go.
