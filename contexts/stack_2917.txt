String theory and background independence I have read that string theory assumes strings live in spacetime defined by general relativity which make the theory background dependent (although general relativity is a background independent theory). Background independence dictates that spacetime emerge from more fundamental ingredient than spacetime. Quoting Brian Greene, \u201cThen, the theories ingredients - be they strings, branes, loops, or something else discovered in the course of further research - coalesced to produce a familiar, large-scale spacetime\u201d (Greene, The Fabric of the Cosmos, 2004: 491).My question: why couldn\u2019t spacetime just be spacetime, a fundamental entity? If so, string theory, based on general relativity, would not be a \u201cgreat unsolved problem\u201d facing string theory.
