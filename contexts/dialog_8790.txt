ARTHUR: I should have left you to fend for yourself.
MERLIN: I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
ARTHUR: So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
MERLIN: Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
ARTHUR: You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
LANCELOT: Good day to you, sir.
ARTHUR: Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
LANCELOT: I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
ARTHUR: I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
LANCELOT: I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
ARTHUR: --That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
LANCELOT: Not a boast, sir, but a curse. Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
ARTHUR: Move aside!
LANCELOT: I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
