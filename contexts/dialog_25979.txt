RACHEL: Just like to make sure. That your past. And my future. Are real different.
LUKE: Well, they will be.
RACHEL: Imagine my relief. So what's for dinner?
LUKE: Why in the world would she t...
RACHEL: You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
LUKE: I needed some time away.
RACHEL: ...while she watched the kids. Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer. But she said...
LUKE: '...the kids have camp. Their friends are here. Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know. My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.' Did it go like that?
LUKE: She called it a fight. <u>The</u> fight.
RACHEL: What do you call it? You told her you had doubts.
LUKE: Can we go sit somewhere?
RACHEL: Let me put it this way. Hell, no.
LUKE: I told her I loved her.
RACHEL: By way of saying you were unhappy.
LUKE: Restless.
RACHEL: Excuse me. 'Things are so confusing for me, Jack. Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able. It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules. When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
LUKE: '...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said. But I didn't leave.
RACHEL: No, she threw you out. What a difficult woman.
