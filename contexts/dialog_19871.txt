MARTIN: Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it? Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr. Or at least I think it was Ringo. It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
WILLIAM: Topol.
MARTIN: That's right -- Topol.
WILLIAM: But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
MARTIN: No, well... he was quite a long way away.
WILLIAM: So it could have been neither of them?
MARTIN: I suppose so.
WILLIAM: Right. It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
MARTIN: Not classic, no.
WILLIAM: Right -- want another one?
MARTIN: Yes. No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
ANNA: Oh Jesus.
WILLIAM: Here, let me help.
