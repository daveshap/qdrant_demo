HUNTER: What's happening up here?
ROBY: I think it's fizzled out.
MELKONIS: I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
HUNTER: But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
MELKONIS: Hell of a defense mechanism. You don't dare kill it.
STANDARD: It's stopped?
MELKONIS: Yes, thank heaven.
STANDARD: We're just plain lucky. That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
MELKONIS: Reminded me of when I was a kid and the roof leaked -- everybody running for the pots and pans.
