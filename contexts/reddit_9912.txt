Question about a Magna Carta for university students
Background: I am studying at the University of the Philippines, where a new Magna Carta for Students is being written (by a congress formed of student representatives from all parts of the university), certain student groups are against the said Magna Carta due to a particular article: “Article X. Section 5. The Board of Regents shall be the final interpreter of the Magna Carta.”

Question: who do you think should be the final interpreter of the Magna Carta? Should it be the board of regents, the student council, or some other group? Why?

P.S. this is the first time I've visited this subreddit, and I'm sorry if this post doesn't belong in here (I really did try to find a suitable subreddit :D)
