How far would you let a job mentally break you before you quit?
I've been looking for something else since January and haven't had a single phone call back. I cannot mentally take being in my current job any longer. It's taking way too long to get something else. I still live at home so money isn't a big deal but I still pay my part. How far would you let a job mentally break you before you quit?
