Prom or No? Last semester I asked my crush to homecoming. She told me IDK (rejection). We are friends. I don’t know what to do, prom is in 2 months, I can’t make my mind up if I should ask her to prom. I don’t want to make anything awkward or anything. *BTW we are both juniors in HS*
EDIT* We are both DRAMA CLUB Kids
