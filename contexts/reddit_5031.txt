I didn't make past the personality test and I don't understand the results
So I was required to give a personality test for role that I applied for. The results were available to be immediately when I gave the test and they were really disappointing. I got 4 (out of 10) on focus and persistence, which I believe is too less. And I got 1 in teamwork. The test result stated that 'Mr. X would create more problems in a team than solving them'. I am not saying that I am a 10 in team work, maybe a 6 or 7. but a 1 ?! The results were really disappointing and I didn't get called for an interview. But I want to understand why did I get these results? What should I do for next time? Are these results a true reflection of me?
