My father compares me to my mother in arguments
(sorry I'm on Mobile)
 for some info: My mom walked out when I was about 7 and my father raised me since.

me and him aren't that close anymore and we got into a argument earlier(about a half hour ago) since  he thought I told him to leave me alone for awhile since I was stressed and he started screaming at me while I just sat there.
he started screaming something along the lines of "oh you're just like your mother, what are you going to do when you live with someone!" While walking around in the other room.
I just yelled back to him " dad I asked nicely and respectfully, neither of you ever have treated me with respect!" And he stormed upstairs without saying anything.
(I kinda find this ironic since I'm 15F and he's acting like a teenager, my grandmother also thinks he acts like a teen)
He also said beforehand "oh you would listen to (stepmoms name) !" Of course I would she's respectful and treats me like a person with my own thoughts and ideas.
