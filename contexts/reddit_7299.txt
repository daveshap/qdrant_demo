I am struggling in my new job and making constant mistakes because no one trained me. I feel like a failure.
I feel absolutely depressed and I don't know what to do anymore. I've been in this new job since October, I came to this department highly recommended and the managers fought to bring me over. It's a brand new job that I have no experience in but I guess they decided that since I excelled so much in my previous departments that I would just fit right in. They trained me for about 30 minutes my first day then immediately thrust me into making big decisions and doing big projects. I've done good jobs, but I've also done some bad ones that have had a lot mistakes. 

They are very nice about it and have admitted several times that I'm making mistakes because they dropped the ball on training me. My supervisor had a meeting with me and said that I came at a bad time when the department was swamped, which is why nobody trained me. But I still feel like a failure. I'm still making mistakes and every day I get discouraged further with every error that is brought to my attention by my team leads. 

This is really affecting my morale, I find myself questioning my abilities and wanting to leave this department. But they still insist on keeping me for some reason. I don't know what to do.
