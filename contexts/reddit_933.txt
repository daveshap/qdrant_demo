For every upvote, I will read one AOL Instant Messenger chat log from my high school days.
I just found a folder of my old chat longs from age 12 to about 20. There's hundreds of files here.

I already think so much about the embarrassing shit I did back in my teenage years. Why not ruin any chance or repairing my social anxiety by reading every single one and committing them to long term memory? It'll be like suicide for my sanity 

I already found one chat where I told one of my online-only female friends that I loved her... I was 13.
