Remote Job requesting I send I9 over email
Hello, so a recruiter is requesting I send an i9 form over email. From my knowledge this is insecure, however I know the  recruiting agency is reputable. I'm worried about my SSN leaking as a result, additionally they are requesting I send my DL and Social Security Card. The job is entirely remote. My sister is employed under this company, so I know it is a legitimate company but I am seriously concerned over sending personal information over email.

Anyone have any advice on how to approach this? I don't want to say something and lose this job opportunity, I already completed the background check and have this last "onboarding" process to do.

EDIT: I did a little more research into the job itself, I know for 100% fact this offer is real now. But, I still question the security of emailing my personal information.
