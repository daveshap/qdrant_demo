Post-apocalyptic novel with four female protagonists, one a marksman I spotted a book in Walmart a few days ago but forgot to note its name. It was either post-apocalyptic or set during the apocalypse. It has four female leads, one of whom was (I think) mentioned as being a marksman on the cover. A snippet inside the book mentioned a gun. The others were (I recall) some kind of biologist, and another a surveyor. It mentioned <blockquote>  \u201c...nature has reclaimed...\u201d</blockquote>and I know the author is a man. I believe the book is recent but I\u2019m not sure.
