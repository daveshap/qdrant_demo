EVELYN: Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
BATEMAN: Do...what.
EVELYN: Get married. Have a wedding.
BATEMAN: Evelyn?
EVELYN: Yes, darling?
BATEMAN: Is your Evian spiked?
EVELYN: We should do it.
BATEMAN: No-I can't take the time off work.
EVELYN: Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
BATEMAN: I don't want to talk about it.
EVELYN: Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
BATEMAN: Because I...want...to...fit...in.
