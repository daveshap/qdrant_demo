Which university systems pays the highest?
I'm in California and I've been applying for jobs as an academic advisor in various colleges. I'm just curious, between the UC , Cal State and community college system, which school offers the highest pay for an academic advisor?

I'm in SoCal OC area if that matters. Thank you!
