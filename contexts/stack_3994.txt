Is the sum of trends of two time series the trend of the sum of the time series? Let's say I have two time-series, A and B. I build time-series C as C=A+B.I estimate the trend of A, let's say I get +0.5 (Theil-Sen).I estimate the trend of B, let's say I get -0.4 (Theil-Sen).Can C have a trend estimate different from +0.1. Can it be negative?Can you give a simple example when this happens (negative C trend)?
