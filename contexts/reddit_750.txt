Lonely
(15, bi, female) I haven't dated anyone in over a year and I'm really missing the connection that I had with my last girlfriend. Several months after we broke up she reached out to me and we were like best friends again for a few months, and I fell for her again, but she's just stopped responding to me entirely like a week ago. It's really upsetting because I don't have many friends and it almost feels like she's just dumped me again. In english we had to write free verse poems and I unlocked my mind and wrote about what it feels like to miss her. Idk what to do, I really want a girlfiend but soo shy.
