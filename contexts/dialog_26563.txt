MACKELWAY: Look at this fellow... or this one.
KULOK: Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
MACKELWAY: He thinks he looks young.
KULOK: What's this country coming to?
MACKELWAY: Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
KULOK: My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
