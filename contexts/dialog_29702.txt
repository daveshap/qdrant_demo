JUNO: Do you like my tomb? The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
HARRY: It's certainly... dramatic.
JUNO: Especially in this light. This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place. I love all ruins.
HARRY: Is that why you got into this business?
JUNO: I've always been a collector at heart. When I see something I want, I have to have it.
HARRY: And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
