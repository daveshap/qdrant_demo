ANDY: But Mom, I can't find him!
MRS. DAVIS: Well, honey, just grab some other toy! Now c'mon!
ANDY: Okay...
ANDY: I couldn't find my Buzz. I know I left him right there.
MRS. DAVIS: Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
SLINKY: It's too short! We need more monkeys!
REX: There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel.
