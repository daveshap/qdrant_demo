BAILEY: We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
STEED: Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
BAILEY: Really?
STEED: Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
BAILEY: Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
STEED: Seriously?
BAILEY: Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
STEED: You don't say. How real does it feel?
BAILEY: As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
STEED: There are limits?
BAILEY: The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
STEED: No need. I'll call again.
