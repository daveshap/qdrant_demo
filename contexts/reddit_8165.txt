Are the allegations in the articles of impeachment released today factually and legally supported?
Today House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/politics/trump-impeachment-articles.html) the introduction of articles of ompeachment against President Donald Trump.

[Those articles of impeachment are available here.](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Articles%20of%20Impeachment.pdf) (PDF)

There are two articles.  I will briefly excerpt the core allegations from each:

* **Article I: Abuse of Power**

>Using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election. He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that included soliciting the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a political opponents, and influence the 2020 United States Presidential election to his advantage. President Trump also sought to pressure the Government of Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official United States Government acts of significant value to Ukraine on its public announcement of the investigations. President Trump engage in this scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit. In so doing, President Trump used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that compromised the national security of the United States and undermined the integrity of the United States democratic process.  He thus ignored and injured the interests of the Nation.

* **Article II: Obstruction of Congress**

>The House of Representatives has engaged in an impeachment inquiry focused on President Trump's corrupt solicitation of the Government of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 United States Presidential election. As part of this impeachment inquiry, the Committees undertaking the investigation served subpoenas seeking documents and testimony deemed vital to the inquiry from various Executive Branch agencies and offices, and current and former officials.  

>In response, without lawful cause or excuse, President Trump directed Executive Branch agencies, offices, and officials not to comply with those subpoenas. President Trump thus interposed the powers of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, and assumed to himself the functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the "sole Power of Impeachment" vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives.

The articles then proceed to describe the means by which the alleged actions were undertaken.  



*  Are the factual claims in the two articles of impeachment supported by evidence from testimony, documentation, or other sources?  Is there any countervailing evidence that shows them to be in doubt?

* Are the legal claims in the two articles of impeachment accurate? Do they comport with past cases of impeachment, criminal law, or other sources of law?
