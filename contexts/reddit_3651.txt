Guy I've Been Seeing for a Month Told Me I'm Too Fat for Him
After a month of dating and hooking up the guy I've been seeing told me his ideal partner is a 5'3 130lbs petite woman.  The conversation occurred because I had stopped doing/tracking my IF. I am not petite, and am working on being healthier but don't feel like my worth as a partner should be directly tied to how much weight I'm losing/not losing.  Any effort to explain how hurtful this was was met with "I guess I'm a bad guy for having sexual preferences."

ETA:  I am 5'7 so no matter how much weight I lost or didn't lose I would still never be his "ideal"

Just feeling a little sad and discouraged this morning.  Thanks for reading <3
