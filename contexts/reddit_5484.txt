How to move up at my job
So, I'm a 23 yo licensed histotechnician and I'm not making what I should be paid. I was hired as an assistant and proceeded through the schooling to become a lab tech. The only raise i received after spending $10k to go through school and pass a I internationally accredited test was $1.50. Normally, a lab tech makes 25-$30 per hour but I'm still in the mid teens with my pay. This has happened to another coworker who still works with me. It seems like they're farming us for our work without giving us a damn bone. After all I would hire someone for tech work at assistant pay. 


Also, they're arent any other jobs in my field posted on my area, so leaving isnt much of an option.
