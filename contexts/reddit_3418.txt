I am about to go on a date with a very pretty girl.
I am freaking out. She is definitely a 10. And I am like a 6 on a good day. She is funny, easy going, and very outspoken. I am more anxious than all hell. 

Wish me luck?

Update: Well for everyone telling me to stay home, good news! She stood me up, so I never left.

Update 2: Thank you for the platinum!!

Update 3: I work at a Walmart, by the way. I have a much lower chance at getting the coronavirus when going on a date for a couple hours with one other person who doesn't have it than going to work, where I am there for several hours 5 or 6 days out of the week. I'm sorry that you feel like this is reckless behavior, but I live in a small town and we weren't planning on going anywhere public. If you want to be upset at me for living my youth the best I can during this time, then you're welcome to do that. Also this isn't really pedestalling, I am just intimated by how I percieve her beauty. I'm sorry if you feel this is cringe-worthy but we can't all have high self-esteems.
