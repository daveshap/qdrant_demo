Special cases in friction Imagine that 2 objects are stacked. The friction between the objects is higher than the friction between the bottom object and the ground. Is it possible for the top object to be pushed hard enough to slide off the bottom object. The applied force is parralel to the ground, no angle.I have tried making equtions for this question, but they led to illogical conclusions (like the bottom object sliding faster than the top one). I asked many people and tried researching it but I cannot find a solid conclusion
