How would we calculate the dipole moment of a charge combination (of 3 or more charges) whose magnitudes are different but net charge is zero? How would we calculate the dipole moment of a charge combination (of 3 or more charges) whose magnitudes are different but net charge is zero?As a special case, what if the net charge is not zero? How would we calculate the dipole moment then?
