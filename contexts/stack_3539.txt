Revealing IP of an email recipient using remote PHP script or pixel tracking I read through the search items and similar threads but my query is rather specific.I know it's possible to reveal IP of an email recipient if we can get the person to click on an attached image or file and then using a remote PHP script running on a server we can extract info about him.My question is that which IP exactly is actually revealed if the person is using a proxy or even TOR.The person uses Protonmail, most likely as webmail.So basically, assuming we can get the person to click on the attachment image, which IP is revealed when:He uses a proxy website to access ProtonmailHe uses a proxy through browser settingsHe uses TOR browser bundle to access Protonmail hidden serviceThanks!
