GRACE: I shot him.
JOHN: You killed him!
GRACE: He was going to take the money.
JOHN: Thirty-thousand, that's all. We would have been free and clear. You didn't have to kill him.
GRACE: It's our money. He had no right to take it.
JOHN: You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?
GRACE: Just drive.
