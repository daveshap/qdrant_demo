MICKEY: I don't understand. I thought that you would be happy.
FATHER: How can we be happy?
MICKEY: Well, because I never thought of God in my life. Now I'm giving it serious thought.
FATHER: But Catholicism? Why not your own people?
MICKEY: Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know. B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
MICKEY: I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
FATHER: But why? We raised you as a Jew.
MICKEY: So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
