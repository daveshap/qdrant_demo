Custom small sized wallpapers in Ubuntu 17.10 When setting a wallpaper in Ubuntu 17.04 I could choose from tile, zoom, center, scale, fill or span options. Where can I found option for 'center' wallpaper behaviour in Ubuntu 17.10?Background: I use two monitors with different resolutions. So I was more than happy to use small image as a wallpaper with white colour filling the rest of the screen. This was done through All Settings -> Appearance -> Look tab in Unity, where I could select option \"center\" and white colour to fill the rest.After updating to Ubuntu 17.10 I was not able to select my custom wallpaper from Background -> Wallpaper menu, so I went to the directory with the image and tried to \"Set as Wallpaper\" option in the menu, but it zoomed image to every screen resolution (it looks awful).So I wonder - How can I set wallpaper to be centred without zoom and to use plain white colour for all the space left?
