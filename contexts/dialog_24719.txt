DAVID LEE: See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
MRS BOATWRIGHT: David!
DAVID LEE: Yes, ma'am...?
MRS. BOATWRIGHT: I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
DAVID LEE: Thank you, Miss Boatwright!
MRS. BOATWRIGHT: Don't mention this to anyone! You hear me, David!
DAVID LEE: Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
REBECCA: Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
CHARLIE: I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
MRS. BOATWRIGHT: Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
CHARLIE: Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
