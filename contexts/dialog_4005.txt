ABBY: ...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
RAY: Yeah? What happened?
ABBY: Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
RAY: ...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
ABBY: Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
RAY: Uh-huh.
ABBY: I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
RAY: What'd he say?
ABBY: Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
RAY: Thanks.
ABBY: Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
RAY: ...Mm-hmm.
ABBY: When you don't they're usually nice.
RAY: ...You ever get tired?
ABBY: Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
