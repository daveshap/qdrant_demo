I'm in love with my bestfriend
I've known her for six year but only recently realised how much I love her. I think I'd rather not tell her than risk ruining our friendship. I can't imagine what my life would be like without her. It's 5 am and I can't stop thinking about this whole situation and about her but I honestly don't know what to do. I hope I don't regret my decision either way.
