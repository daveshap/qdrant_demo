VAMPIRA: Who?
ED'S VOICE: Ed Wood! You came to my party. I directed Bride Of The Atom"!"
VAMPIRA: Oh. Yeah. You.
ED'S VOICE: Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
VAMPIRA: You mean like a date? I thought you were a fag.
ED'S VOICE: ME?! No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
VAMPIRA: Isn't that the same thing?
ED'S VOICE: No, no! I like girls. So how 'bout Friday?
VAMPIRA: Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type. But keep in touch. Let me know when your movie opens.
