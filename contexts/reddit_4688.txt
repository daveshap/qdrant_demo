My life is in shambles and I just want to feel happy again...
So about two years ago, my parents forced me to move cross country to accommodate for my dads new job. Now, I’m 25, am a year away from losing my parents health care, jobless, and am isolated to the point where the depression I have is only getting worse by the day.

Now, the things that used to keep me temporarily happy aren’t filling that void anymore. Help.
