how do you get over a boy that doesn’t like you back?
the first time i met him my friend called dibs and told me she wanted him so i backed off and let her have her shot. i got really close with him and we were great friends, hanging out every minute we could. i stupidly caught feelings when i knew my friend wanted him so once again i didn’t act on anything even when he kept giving me signals. i fell in love with him and we would cuddle and makeout sometimes which didn’t help me. he always said he was going to be there for me for anytime i needed him and told me several times he was going to marry me one day and then one day it just stopped. he stopped talking to me stopped hanging out with me. i went from seeing him every day and every night to never because he found a girl he wanted to fuck. he was one of my only friends and i don’t know how to get over him and i’d really like to.
