FRANK: He killed her John. He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
JOHN: It's not your fault, Dad.
FRANK: Yes it is...we did this. We changed everything. I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire. I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
JOHN: No.
FRANK: This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
JOHN: I know... But Dad, you can't go back. You didn't die in that fire. And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that. So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
FRANK: I don't think I can. I'm not a cop. I can't. I can't stop this guy.
JOHN: But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
FRANK: Johnny, I know, but...
JOHN: I need you to believe in me. To believe that we can do this.
FRANK: John, he's got my driver's license.
JOHN: What?
FRANK: He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
JOHN: He took your wallet?
FRANK: No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
JOHN: He touched your wallet! Where's your wallet?
FRANK: In my pocket.
JOHN: We got him! Dad you got him!
FRANK: What?
JOHN: His prints. You've got his prints. I'll run them through criminal index. You gotta get me that wallet.
FRANK: How the hell am I gonna do that?
JOHN: Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
FRANK: What...
JOHN: Please, Dad, just do it.
FRANK: Okay, okay...
FRANK: I got it.
JOHN: Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
FRANK: Huh?
JULIA: Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years! Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
FRANK: I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
JOHN: It's gonna work, Dad. We're gonna stop him.
FRANK: Hang on.
