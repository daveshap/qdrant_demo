ROBERT: You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
FRANCESCA: No. I'll do them later.
ROBERT: Francesca?
FRANCESCA: What?
ROBERT: Are you all right?
FRANCESCA: Yes.
ROBERT: Francesca?
FRANCESCA: What?
ROBERT: We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
MICHAEL: He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
CAROLYN: Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
MICHAEL: Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
CAROLYN: I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married. At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
MICHAEL: I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
CAROLYN: Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
MICHAEL: Then why do you?
CAROLYN: And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
