JERRY: How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
ADAM: I was thinking of selling all the cards.
JERRY: Really? No kidding?
ADAM: See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller. Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
JERRY: I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
ADAM: Oh, that would be wonderful!
JERRY: Well, we're here to help!
