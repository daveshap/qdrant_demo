FRANKLIN'S VOICE: Hello, Joseph, trouble?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Looks like we'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: Yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: You sent for me, sir?
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Splendid! Is he sick?
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: What's that book you've got there?
CLARENCE'S VOICE: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
FRANKLIN'S VOICE: Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Poor George . . . Sit down.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Sit down? What are . . .
JOSEPH'S VOICE: If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Well, naturally. Of course.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Where? I don't see a thing.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Why, yes. This is amazing.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Oh, wonderful!
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Hey, who's that?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: That's your problem, George Bailey.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: A boy?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
