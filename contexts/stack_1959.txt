What does \"pans\" mean in this passage? I am currently translating a book called \"#GIRLBOSS\" by Sophia Amoruso and there's a phrase I can't clarify its meaning.\"I was proud of my video project, which was a series of pans with Bad Religion's angst-ridden song \"Infected\" as the soundtrack. Bam, shot of the Nike factory outlet store. Bam, shot of money. Bam, shot of graveyard.\"I've scanned each and every meaning of 'pan' to no avail. I think the word is describing the images of Nike, money, graveyard etc in whole, but I can't see the connection between them.
