A Tip on being at the top. It got me my current job, and I only did it for a couple of days.
After being unemployed for about 4 months, I decided that what I was doing wasn't working. I was just applying at websites using their long Application Form. It just wasn't working well at all, because you spend about 10 minutes filling it in and they look at it for 5 seconds and click Next.

So I got this idea. I went on Gumtree (Go to your equivalent website, so like Craigslist or something), sort by your area and then click on Jobs. Put on a film, and every 2 minutes, just click Refresh. You'll see the new jobs up, which is when you apply with your usual CV and Cover Letter. I had made about 4 different cover letters depending on the job I was applying to and copy and pasted it from Notepad. That way, when you apply, you're usually the first one they see and they will click you.

In my previous job, we did recruitment via Gumtree and that's how I did it. I just looked at the first few before I realised I couldn't be bothered to look through them all and only chose the first few.

Doing this landed me my current job as a Hotel Manager, so hopefully it'll work for you!
