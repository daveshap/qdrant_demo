BEE-BEE: That was really great.
SOOZE: Was it okay?
BEE-BEE: Yeah!
SOOZE: What did you guys think?
BEE-BEE: Slides go with it.
SOOZE: Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
JEFF: Was that supposed to be me?
SOOZE: No.
JEFF: Yes.
BEE-BEE: It's called Burger Manifesto
SOOZE: Why is everything about you, Jeff?
JEFF: No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
SOOZE: Man?
JEFF: Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
SOOZE: It's a piece.
JEFF: Your sure as hell right about that.
SOOZE: I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
BUFF: Ah, you know people there?
SOOZE: I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
JEFF: The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you."
SOOZE: I don't want to hear it anymore.
JEFF: No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
SOOZE: Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
JEFF: Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
SOOZE: Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
TIM: Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
SOOZE: At least I have a point of view, you know?
BEE-BEE: Uh-huh.
SOOZE: I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
JEFF: What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
SOOZE: So you can give me more shit?
JEFF: No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
SOOZE: I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
BEE-BEE: Mn-hm.
JEFF: Burger Manifesto
SOOZE: Yes, you asshole.
JEFF: About what?
SOOZE: About things that are important to me.
JEFF: Like what?
SOOZE: Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
BEE-BEE: Um-hm.
JEFF: Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
SOOZE: Of course I do!
JEFF: Name one.
SOOZE: God, KAREN JOHNSON.
JEFF: One!
SOOZE: Your completely missing the point.
JEFF: Hey!
SOOZE: I'm talking about idealism.
BEE-BEE: Responsibility, progress.
SOOZE: Yes.
JEFF: No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
SOOZE: No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
JEFF: No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
SOOZE: But do you stand for anything?
JEFF: Yes, I stand for -
SOOZE: What? What do you stand for?
JEFF: I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
SOOZE: Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
JEFF: Can I talk here? Let me talk.
SOOZE: You know, all you know is what's good for you.
JEFF: Can I talk?
SOOZE: Typical male.
BEE-BEE: Typical male.
SOOZE: Typical male.
BEE-BEE: Typical male.
SOOZE: Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
TIM: Seriously? It's a great idea.
SOOZE: Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
TIM: I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
SOOZE: I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
JEFF: Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
SOOZE: Um, because you didn't want to go.
JEFF: Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
SOOZE: Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
