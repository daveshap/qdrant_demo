HENRYK: You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
SZPILMAN: You're out, aren't you?
HENRYK: Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
SZPILMAN: I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
HENRYK: What did you pay him?
SZPILMAN: Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
HENRYK: I can look after myself!
SZPILMAN: They were taking you away.
HENRYK: It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
SZPILMAN: You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
HENRYK: That's also my business.
SZPILMAN: What's the matter? Are you sick?
HENRYK: Hungry.
SZPILMAN: What's that mean, no employment certificate?
HENRYK: You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
SZPILMAN: Otherwise what?
HENRYK: You'll be deported.
