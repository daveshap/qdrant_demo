KIT: Hi.
VISITOR: Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
KIT: Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
VISITOR: Really?
KIT: Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
VISITOR: No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
KIT: Well, he didn't have it last night.
KIT: What's that?
VISITOR: Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
KIT: Sure.
