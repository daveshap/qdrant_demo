Too many people post their successes without posting advice/tips/strategies. This place is becoming a huge circlejerk.
Iâ€™m happy that so many of you can get out from under your debts. Screenshots are great. Congratulations. 

I just wish there was more discussion of HOW you managed or budgeted or saved, etc.
