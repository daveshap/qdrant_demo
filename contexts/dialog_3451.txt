EDWARD: Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
KARL: Really?
EDWARD: Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
KARL: I can.
EDWARD: So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
KARL: You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
EDWARD: What's your name, Giant?
KARL: Karl.
EDWARD: Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you. You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
KARL: You don't like it?
EDWARD: I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this. So what do you say? Join me?
KARL: Okay.
EDWARD: Okay.
