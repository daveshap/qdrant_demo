"Why don't you get a girlfriend?"
What the fuck.

What the actual fuck.

HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU BE SO FUCKING CASUAL ABOUT THIS?

I've heard this from counselors. I've heard this from therapists. The cocksucking psychiatrist who diagnosed me with PTSD, MDD and BPD ("borderline traits") told me this.

How the actual fuck can people be so fucking casual about a romantic relationship?

Do y'all mfs just think I can go to Amazon and order one?

I- I don't get it. I don't get it.  I DON'T FUCKING GET IT. WHAT THE FUCK.

LIKE I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST GO UP TO A GIRL I LIKE AND SAY "hey i like u let's date because my psychiatrist said so" FUCK YOU YOU TRIVIALISING PIECES OF HUMAN TRASH.

fuck you.

fuck you for telling an ugly fat incel to go get a girlfriend like it's no big deal.

fuck you for treating the idea of a girl's love like it means nothing.

and fuck you fuck you fuck you for even trying to tell me that there's any chance in the fucking world that a girl can like anything about me, because i can guaran-fucking-tee you that in the 5 years since i first went on meds, since i first went to therapy, after all the working out and hospitalizations, I've only become worse.

Fuck you for not listening to me and gaslighting me whenever I say I'm unlovable you fucking "professionals". 

Fuck you for not taking me seriously when I literally carved the word "unlovable" all over my body.

Fuck you for trivialising and reducing love down to nothing.

Because guess what you fucking sorry excuse of a mental health system, some of us don't get love or kindness just because we need it. 

I didn't go to you just because I saw and experienced a lifetime of emotional, mental, physical and sexual abuse. I didn't go to you just because I was and still am constantly bullied for the way I look and act. 

No one will ever fucking love me for any part of what I am or do, and your amazing lack of sympathy and downright intolerance for that fact, the kind of intolerance that lead you to actually get angry at me at even suggesting the idea that girls don't like fat, ugly guys, you fucking "professional", it's truly incredible. Leaving meds and help behind didn't make my life better, but it's really amazing how little leaving medical help behind affected me; life was and is getting worse, I was and am and will be unlovable, I should've and need to kill myself as soon as fucking possible


So stop treating girlfriends like it's just another pill you can prescribe. Not only is it not a poor girl's job to "fix" me or handle the burden of my bullshit, it's certainly not your right to tell me to find love when I'm SITTING AT YOUR FUCKING DESK BECAUSE LOVE AND KINDNESS WON'T EVER BE A PART OF MY LIFE YOU IGNORANT FUCK I HOPE SOMEONE FORCES YOU TO EAT THE CURB MAY YOUR JAW TURN TO ASHES
