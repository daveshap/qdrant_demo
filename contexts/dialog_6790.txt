JANI: Is it yes?
JACK: Yes.
JANI: Thank you.
JACK: It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
JANI: Well, life's not fair. We know that.
JACK: It's all relative. I need the money too.
JANI: Do you?
JACK: Yes.
JANI: The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
JACK: That bruise has cleared up nicely.
JANI: Bruise? Oh, yes. It's better.
JACK: I've still got mine.
JACK: And your hand too.
JANI: I took the bandage off yesterday.
JANI: Would you like a drink?
JACK: No thank you.
JACK: I don't think we should meet again.
JANI: It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
