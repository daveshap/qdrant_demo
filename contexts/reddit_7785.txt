Looking for Remote Research Opportunities. What should I do?
Hey! I'm a final year Undergrad student pursuing Psychology. 

I want to pursue research in the long run, but I feel like I don't have the skills or knowledge at the moment. I've read a lot about STEM research but couldn't find enough information about Social sciences. 

So I was wondering if there are any Remote Research internships or opportunities in social sciences that I could take up to improve my skills and learn. 

I find research intriguing but also intimidating. Any tips on improvement? 

Your help is much appreciated! Thank you!
