JOHANA: Thanks for helping with the bag. It looks great!
JACQUES: I thought it was a nice place. Isn't it?
JOHANA: I'm being a pain in the ass. It's beautiful here.
JOHANA: You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
JACQUES: I don't know... why?
JOHANA: Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
JACQUES: Yes... Maybe... I don't know. I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun. Don't you think?
JOHANA: I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
JACQUES: Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it. It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
