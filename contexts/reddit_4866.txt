I feel like I'm being replaced again and it hurts so much.
We used to hang out and talk all the time, now it takes weeks for my friend to message me back, and it's almost always a one or two word response. My friend doesn't hang out with me anymore, they hang out with someone else now. I feel like I'm slowly being forgotten. This has happened to me before, so I was sort of expecting it to happen Again, but it still hurts so much. I don't want to go through this again.
