BOWMAN: Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
HAL: Sure, Dave, what's up?
BOWMAN: You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
HAL: Yes, I know.
BOWMAN: You probably also know that we found them okay.
HAL: Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
