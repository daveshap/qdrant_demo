LESTAT: What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
LOUIS: I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
LESTAT: What do you imagine you are Louis?
LOUIS: I don't pretend to know.
LESTAT: Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
LOUIS: Lestat, she's alive!!!!
LESTAT: Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
LOUIS: The girl, Lestat -
LESTAT: I know. Let her alone.
