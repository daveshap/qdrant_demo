How Not to Pick Up Girls.
I'm a bartender in a small town. Two decently attractive girls come in and order their drinks. An hour or so later a guy comes in, orders, then starts to attempt to chat them up. They are uninterested, he doesn't get the hint. He goes to the bathroom, and while he's gone they zip-the-hell out of there.

Next day I get a call from the bartender that is opening. 

"Do you know the blonde girl that was sitting on x side of the bar?"

 "Who?" (I was napping)

"Some very attractive blonde girl was in the bar last night"

"I guess"

"Do you know her?"

"Nope"

"Well, if she comes in again there's an envelope under the register for them"

"Ok" (Let me sleep)

So obviously what happened was, mister catch-a-hint brought a letter that morning. They steamed that shit open. Inside: 

"you two are the most beautiful girls I've ever seen blablabla next time you drink is on me" *leaves 20$* for them.*

As deliciously cringe and cheesy-stupid as that is, he left the same kind of note to one of our neighbor bars about a different girl, on the same day!

We did get the letter to the girls, they laughed.

Moral of the story, take the L when it is handed to you nicely. Returning for the second round douch-o-rama, Not effective.
