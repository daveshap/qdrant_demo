SALESMAN: Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
WOMAN: Can't you please finish your drink?
MRS. BUNDY: That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
SALESMAN: They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything. They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
MRS. BUNDY: The point is that no one seemed to get upset about it. They were gone the next morning, just as if nothing at all had happened. Poor things.
WOMAN: I'm leaving! Are you coming?
SALESMAN: All right, all right! Hope you figure this out, folks.
