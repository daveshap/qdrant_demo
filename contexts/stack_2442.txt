Get sum of a field for each element of overlapping paths I've used the very useful Openroute service to develop a number of routes which I have populated with traffic numbers (on each route). I want each section of road to present the total of a field (across multiple records) on each segment of road. The routes fan out like tree branches so the routes close to the point of interest have many individual paths overlying one another, until it gets a to point on the network where just the destination is on a route. I've tried a few ways but I either get a sum of the whole dataset, or a sequence of numbers on all the underlying routes. I can get the answer the long way around by selecting the underlying routes and then inspecting using the Statistics Panel 'Sum' but I'm sure there must be a much easier cleverer way of doing this. FURTHER INFO: It\u2019s difficult to visualise as the routes often overlap, but let me try to describe it differently. I have undertaken a set of route plans using open route service. These are sometimes overlaying and sometimes separate. Each individual route line has 4 values attached to it, AM IN (Arrivals in the morning peak), AM OUT (departures in the morning peak), PM IN (arrivals in the PM peak) and finally PM OUT (departures in the evening peak).I want to present vales on the plan that show the total value on each section of the routes, summed together. So for example if routes AB,AC,AD all ran over an element of common route the sum of their values would be presented. For each section of road I want to show the specific value of AM IN /AM OUT on that section of road. Essentially if i select the routes and use the Statistics panel the sum of selected routes shows me the right answer - but this is laborious.
