Starting a 100 hour work week starting tomorrow- Need tips
I'm in a situation where I absolutely need the second job right now. The 2nd one I recently got is 10 hour shifts and the original is a typical 8 hours a day. The 1st job I have Mondays and Tuesdays off, and the 2nd has Saturday and Sunday off. So my real struggle days will be Wednesday through Friday because I work both those days and I'll try to make up the lack of sleep on the days I'm just working one job.

My first job is flexible so I could try doing something like 6 hour days and/or 4 days a week to help a bit. I'd still have 80+ hours. I have to do this because my transportation situation right now is crap and I don't have reliable people to take me to work. Uber/lyft everyday is expensive so if I just work one job I'll literally have no way to ever save for a car. I thought I would have a roommate so I wouldn't have to do this but they flaked out on me.

Also they're both the "physically demanding" type of jobs but I'm used to that by now. The main thing I'll be doing is fighting my sleepiness. I also posted in r/productivity but only got one response so far from someone who clearly only read the title.
