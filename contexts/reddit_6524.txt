Started new job & feeling so lost! Is this normal?
I came from a company which is pretty easy but for the pretty easy work we only get paid 14 dollars. We never had any meetings daily or conference calls daily. Wasn’t really corporate. Just a basic desk job. 

I found a job through my best friend. She’s my trainer & my boss is awesome. We are part of a really small team in a pretty big company. It’s my second day and both my best friend & my boss said it’ll take a month to learn everything. But I have no clue how. The information. There’s so many little steps I have to remember. All these rules for different accounts. Ten accounts or more. I haven’t started training classes yet but I am sitting with my best friend & she’s showing me what she does and is giving me the training. I know it’s only the second day but I’m freaking out silently. Yes I’m taking notes and yes I’m listening into calls. But I feel useless because I’m not doing anything really. The information is sometimes confusing. There’s so many emails being sent out. Documents. Files. 

The office environment is great. People are super nice. Love the space. I am used to the office environment. And can deal with the rules (it’s more lax here) 

I’m just freaking out it’ll take me longer than a month to learn all this stuff.  I feel totally lost. My boss understands & so does my best friend but I still feel bad. 

Any advice? Stories? Help!
