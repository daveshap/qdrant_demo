LYMAN: Is it for real?
SHERMIN: Get Fox.
SHERMIN: It's real, George.
FOX: There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
SHERMIN: I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
FOX: Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?

FOX: Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
SHERMIN: Neither did I.
FOX: We're going... Damn! We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?

FOX: Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
SHERMIN: We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
FOX: I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
SHERMIN: Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?
FOX: Contain it and get back to me.
SHERMIN: What do you mean by 'contain?'
