MARSH: There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
HARRY: Now who are we talking about?
MARSH: Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
HARRY: Wasn't Hocker lynched?
MARSH: You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
HARRY: What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
