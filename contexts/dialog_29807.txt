LEE: Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
CLARENCE: Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'. Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit. He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
LEE: Why does he trust you?
CLARENCE: We grew up together.
LEE: If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
CLARENCE: I bullshitted him.
