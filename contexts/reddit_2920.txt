Recruiters, what does it mean when you ask - "Are you currently pursuing any other jobs/opportunities?"
Recruiters, HR and hiring managers, I've started getting a lot of phone screens and interviews and have been asked if ive been applying to other roles. 

What do they mean by this? 
Is there an ulterior motive? 
Do some recruiters exclude candidates who are applying elsewhere?
How should I respond?
