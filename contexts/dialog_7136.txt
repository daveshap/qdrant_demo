REED: What are you gonna do?
BOB: I'm going to kill him.
REED: You can't kill a President.
BOB: He's not a President! He's an ordinary person. I can kill an ordinary person.
REED: Bob...
BOB: I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
REED: He's only doing what you told him to.
BOB: What I told him to?
REED: I heard you. You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
BOB: Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
REED: He was only doing his job.
