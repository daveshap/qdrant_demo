Does really bad weather soothe anyone else's anxiety?
For a very long time now any time there's a bad storm or something, it makes my anxiety go down so much. To the point I like to put on storm sounds when I sleep at night. I really don't get it, I was deathly afraid of storms when I was a kid. But I check the weather all the time to see when it's going to storm. I sleep better and even feel better and more energized all day. I hope I'm not alone.
