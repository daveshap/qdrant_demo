Install alongside windows option ubuntu 18.04 low swap I have a ThinkPad P1 with 64GB ram. I have installed Ubuntu 18.04, and selected install alongside windows option to leave Ubuntu to handle everything during the installation on 1TB SSD which I have allocated 450GB to Ubuntu.Once installation completed, I have checked the system and noticed ubuntu only gave 2GB to the swaps partition. I was wondering if this is normal. What if the system requires more SWAPS, what would happen then?Thx
