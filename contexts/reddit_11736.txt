I want to switch career choices. But none of my superiors agree.
So I was into music the past about 2 years in school and another 3 before that in guitar. (that I never really enjoyed) I play the alto sax, am good at playing it, reading the music, but am not really all that good theory. 

Other the summer I got a job working at a factory and my father holds a high level position there so I was able to have some time doing maintenance work even though it was not what I signed up for. I enjoyed it. A lot. And there are far more jobs for this than in Music.

I'm thinking of switching because I don't want to sink tens of thousands of dollars into university were I would most likely hate the courses, sitting there listen to a prof ramble on for hours on music theory etc, when I can go to college, learn a trade which I like doing, hopefully find a good job somewhere and live comfortably. 

I'm afraid to tell anyone I want to switch career choices because they all feel like I'm some amazing player who deserves to be living in vegas with a million dollars at all times in my bank account. *of course that was exaggerated* But you get the point. I kind of told my music teacher this and she got rather course with me, and I can't even begin to think of how to tell my parents. I am unsure of what to do here.

TL;DR Was into music, tried Mechanic/trade work, loved it, want to that instead because it has a more certain future than going to uni for music and trying my entire life to make a solid income. Don't know how to break the news to my superiors/supporters.
