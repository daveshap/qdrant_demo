Should I email another HR rep?
I've been waiting to get a start date for my new job for about 5 weeks. The only reason I've waited this long is because it would be the best job I've ever had, in an industry that I'm super excited to get into. I've been trying to get in touch with one HR rep that I've met in person, and that I passed all my paperwork into.

So, I've emailed the first HR rep twice, the first time I got no response, the second time I emailed her after I was notified that I was registered w the state, and I wanted to know if there was anything else I should be doing. The response was very generic/vague. Pretty much just said my paperwork is under "review." Didnt answer my question, if anything it left me more confused than before.

This other rep I'm thinking about emailing has been out since july 3 and is back tomorrow. I emailed her once, and got am auto response saying shes out. Sucks, but whatever.

I have it all written out, pretty much saying that I got the register email, but I'm not sure what I should be doing now and that the first HR rep didnt really give me an answer. I also say that it's been a long process, I'm frustrated, and I'm going to considering another offer because I still dint have a start date and I would just like to know where my employment stands and what I should be doing now.

So, i guess my question is, is this like.... too Dramaticâ„¢? Part of me says be as assertive as I f-ing can be, but I'm really afraid of risking my chance at this job bc like I said, very good job in an industry I'm very passionate about and I really want the gd job ðŸ˜­
