Just had my first kiss(es) at the age of 20
Last night I went on the first date with my gf since we had recently became official, and towards the end of the night we went to a Walmart,  fucked around for like an hour, and when we got back in the car, it finally happened and I had my first mouth to mouth kiss. Well, technically there was more then just one, and believe me I wish we could’ve just sat in that car and did that the whole night but she’s going out of town tomorrow and had to b up early today so I had to take her hm shortly after. However, I got to kiss her some more before she got out when I dropped her off, so that was good.

Honestly as a 20 year old who had nvr even held a girl’s hand (let alone kiss one) up until this girl I’m with now, it’s all a bit surreal. Nvr could picture myself in a relationship before, just seemed so out of reach for me. But it finally happened, and if it can happen for my romantically hopeless ass, it can happen for anyone who was just as hopeless as me up until not so long ago. Don’t be discouraged, Ik it’s cliche, but it’s true; the right person will come along.
