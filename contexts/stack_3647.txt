Is there any methodology to detect smart deauthentication attack? I'm a project student in IIT-Hyderabad. I have been working in Wifi security domain for my M.Tech. In particular, I chose de-authentication attack.Whenever I sent De-Auth frames continuously to APs  for limited time I got detected by IDS. But When I sent limited frames randomly I was not  detected. I am curious to know if there is any methodology to analyze this kind of smart attack using techniques like machine learning/ wavelets/signal processing etc.   Can any one please suggest papers to read on Wireless IDS for detecting the attack if attack is done randomly or periodically  (when attacker sends limited frames less than or equal to the threshold value of detector).Thank You.
