Minecraft wrong FPS I've played a bit with Minecraft Windows 10 edition which is awesome fast and fluid.I've then tried the demo version of the original game, but it happens to feel laggy.What I don't understand, is that the FPS counter ingame (F3) shows a nearly constant 60FPS (drop sometimes to 59).My screen is a 60hz screen, so I don't understand why the game feels so slow.Is the FPS counter in the game accurate ? My hardware is a decent laptop Core I7 6700HQ, 16GB of RAM and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M.I also tweaked the computer with:JVM arguments to increase RAMinstalled latest Java runtime, and made the minecraft launcher use thissetup in the NVIDIA control panel to use the GPU and not CPU on the javaw process (F3 shows me the correct GPU)
