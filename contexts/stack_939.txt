Shorcut to insert bullet point \u2022 into text in Linux (Ubuntu 18.04LTS) I am new to Linux and I would like to insert the character that corresponds to the bullet point \u2022 when typing text.I know that I can to do by typing (Crtl+Shift+u and then 2022) but that is quite a tedious solution and I am looking for a easier way to do so (on my macbook, running OSX, it is Alt+8 for instance).I am running Ubuntu 18.04LTS.Thank you for your help!
