BRIAN: Yeah. Big fan.
SWAYZAK: And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
BRIAN: Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
SWAYZAK: No need to be modest, Brian.
BRIAN: No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
SWAYZAK: -- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
BRIAN: Every little boy's fantasy.
SWAYZAK: Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
BRIAN: I have a job.
SWAYZAK: This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
BRIAN: Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
SWAYZAK: Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
