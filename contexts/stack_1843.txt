Why are 'quarts' called 'quarts'? I read the poem 'A Roadside Stand' by Robert Frost, and I have accumulated a few questions through the poem. So, I will be posting some questions from the same poem, if you can please answer my other questions as well. Thanks to all :)See the quote below. In this, the writer has used the word 'quarts' for most probably the wooden boxes in which strawberries are kept. When I searched on the internet about 'quart', I found that it is actually by definition a unit of measurement. So, my question is that - Are quarts (i.e the boxes) called quarts because these boxes are of 1-quart volume? or is it called a quart for another reason? Can I call any wooden box a quart?<blockquote>  The polished traffic passed with a mind ahead,<br>  Or if ever aside a moment, then out of sorts<br>  At having the landscape marred with the artless paint<br>  Of signs that with N turned wrong and S turned wrong<br>  Offered for sale wild berries in wooden quarts,<br>  Or crook-necked golden squash with silver warts,<br>  Or beauty rest in a beautiful mountain scene</blockquote>
