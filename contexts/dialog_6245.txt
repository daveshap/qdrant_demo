MAX: He fell on my cab! From up th-th-there.
VINCENT: You always stutter?
MAX: Yeah, yeah. Shit, man. Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.
MAX: I think he's dead.
VINCENT: No shit. Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
MAX: You - you killed him?
VINCENT: No-no, I-I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him.
