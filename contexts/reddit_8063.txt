MSF Programs... FSU & USF. Need help differentiating
Hi, I got into the MSF programs at both FSU and USF. I wanted to reach out and see if anyone had any experience with these programs and any advice about what makes them unique. I am having trouble differentiating the programs and what would be best for me. Additionally, does anyone have any advice on what factors to take into account when making the final decision? I currently am a senior at FSU and enjoy it, but am completely open to attending USF. Just trying to make the right decision... Thanks for your help.
