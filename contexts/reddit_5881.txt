College Degree
I’m thinking about a degree in economics/finance/management. (US)

Do you think these fields will be in demand for the next 5~10 years? What is the typical salary earned by graduates of these majors?

I’m thinking of becoming an investment banker. Is this job in relative demand? Any other jobs that would be profitable in the future?

If you took the time to read this, thank you! 

All answers are definitely appreciated.
