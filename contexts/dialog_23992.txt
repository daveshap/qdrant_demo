VIKTOR: Thank God for you, Faith. I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in. You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
FAITH: No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky. How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
VIKTOR: You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er... ... scent.
FAITH: Of course.
VIKTOR: You look so, so...
FAITH: ... so much like her?
VIKTOR: Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
FAITH: I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
