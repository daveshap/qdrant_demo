MacBook Pro question on former owner I have a used MacBook.  The former user was still the admin so I Googled and followed instructions to remove his password and get myself in as admin.  I then deleted his user account.  I just looked at my settings on my iPhone and saw under messages \"share with FORMER USERS NAME MacBook\"How do I get his name off of everything?  I don't see him at all under user accounts. I don't have any discs, install media, etc.
