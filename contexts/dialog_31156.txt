SAM: Yeah, well, you fixed that. What the hell happened, anyway?
RAY: The bitch shot me, is what happened.
RAY: Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
SAM: Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something? You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
RAY: Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle? Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it. We should be celebrating. This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
SAM: Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed. What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
