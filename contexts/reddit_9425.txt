Tips for getting out of poverty.
I’ve been really hesitant to post this because I’m worried about backlash but I thought I should share what I’ve taken away over the years and hope this would benefit others. I’ve been a longtime lurker with random posts sprinkled around but I wanted to share some tips in hopes that it can give someone out there guidance on getting out of poverty.

Some background real quick, I’ve grown up a minority in poverty with a younger brother and a single mom.  I worked in fast food starting at $6.25/hr and banking from the age of 15 till late college. In the last 7 years I’ve graduated from college ended my full-time teller role and have been fulfilling my career choice as a designer throughout multiple roles. I live in an area with an average cost of living making close to six figures with plenty of room to grow. Here are some tips for things I’ve learned throughout the years that might be useful for people looking to break out of poverty, I hope it can help someone.

Quick Note: There is no guaranteed list of tips that you will make it out of poverty, regardless of how hard/smart you work. There are plenty of factors of which you can't control, and many people are unfortunately and unfairly chained in place because of the society we live in. I hold the opinion that you do have a say in how much you let it affect you mentally and emotionally, and those thoughts can and will adjust your advancement through life.



**Tip #1: Health is your first wealth**

Stay healthy, keeps your mind fresh and body strong. Hopefully, less doctor visits too! This should really be the longest paragraph as it’s probably the most important but we all know the benefits of a healthy lifestyle. I do not mean you should be an all-star athlete, but somewhat conscious about what you put into your body and what your daily routine entails.



**Tip #2: Counter lifestyle/expense creep**

When new monthly expenses come up try to pull funding from something else; do you have a monthly payment plan for a medical bill? It may be time to shop for new car insurance plans, look at phone plans, lower internet speed plan, cancel cable, try a cheaper gym, or maybe cancel Netflix, Hulu or Spotify. Do not continue to tack on expenses without trying to balance out new expenses with old ones. It may not always be possible to balance out new expenses but it helps. This is a habit I follow to this day and it has definitely limited me from an unhealthy lifestyle creep.



**Tip  #3: Workplace loyalty is worthless.**

I’ve literally worked myself to permanent damage to my body for a company that praised me, offered me a 5% raise and months later wanted to force me out because of stress-related health issues. I left and couldn’t be happier, but my illness will most likely stick around for life and is a constant reminder of what a stressful, thankless job can do. In 2 years since leaving I’ve found more meaningful employment, a 42% increase in salary, and amazing benefits.

As u/txdahlia mentioned, do not burn your bridges no matter how awful your time was, and if you have an exit interview, offer constructive feedback in a professional manner. It is not a good idea to quit your job if you do not have another one lined up.



**Tip #4: Strive to be the best version of yourself, and be a little social.**

Be the best at what you do, that includes your job, but as noted before don’t get carried away. Strive to be the best friend, brother, uncle you can be to others by lending an ear, spend time with the family, go out with coworkers or invite them to a game night. This is more for building self-confidence, especially as an introvert.



**Tip #5: Be uncomfortable**

Push yourself to be uncomfortable positions. When I started working it was fast food from high school through most of college. I knew I was limited in my earning potential and then a friend of mine got a job at a bank and I thought “If he can do it, so can I”. I knew it’d be stressful, I’d be uncomfortable and would do things I’d never done before. It scared me to death to touch money (I was a cook in fast food), so much that I even bought Monopoly money to practice counting. I took it on and that position helped me gain soft skills in talking to people in all kinds of situations even to this day. This was my first real experience with trying something new and it paid off, don’t ever get comfortable.



**Tip #6: Learn from your mistakes / It’s ok to fail.**

What I didn’t tell you was that I horribly failed my first bank teller interview, I was the youngest person in a group interview and inexperienced as can be, what I did learn was what the interviewers responded positively to and how to take that to my next bank interview. I ended up getting that position that lasted me through college. Today I learn from my mistakes in other ways but that was the start.



**Tip #7: Invest in yourself**

Most people think of investing as stocks, and bonds. The truth is unfortunately most people aren’t in a position to get into buying company shares and that’s fine for now. Invest in yourself by learning new skills that will make you valuable in your career path or daily life. Listen to podcasts about leadership, money management, read a bit about human psychology, the list goes on and on.



**Tip #8: Invest in yourself, again. (Stocks this time)**

If you’re still hung up on investing with money, please first look into having an emergency fund, pay off high interest debts, joining your companies 401k plan, opening a Roth IRA, and then maybe, start something like M1Finance which will let you get started with a few bucks, don’t expect much though. Investing is about time in the market not timing the market. I highly recommend investing early, something I wish I started doing in college but didn’t really start doing until my late 20’s.



**Tip#9: Try to make your “wants” correlate with your needs.**

I wanted a decent camera for a long time so I took a photography class as an elective in college that required a mid-grade digital camera. I spent a pretty penny and still use this camera today. It really wasn’t high-end back then and definitely isn’t today, but since I’ve bought it I’ve made the initial cost of the camera and lenses back ten times over, in fact I’ll be shooting an event this weekend, and getting paid for a hobby I took up in college, it’s also been helpful in my prior workplaces as well. (This is an example of Tip #7)



**Tip 10: There’s a time for everything.**

There are some “wants” that never go away but it doesn’t mean you need to spring on them right away. Patience, friend. Understand most wants are not fulfilling and once you have it it’ll likely loose most of its shiny pretty quickly. Instead set a goal date, maybe create a goal savings tied to it, if your item costs $100, try to save $200 before buying your item to ensure that you have some money left over if an emergency suddenly comes out of nowhere.



**Tip #11: Shop for mid-grade items if possible.**

You don’t always need the best, but that doesn’t always mean you should get the worst either. As we know cheap items don’t last long. Shop for mid-grade products if you can afford them, they’ll most likely last as long as the high-end product, or work just as well.



**Tip #12: Hide money from yourself. (If you can)**

I’ve noticed that when my bank account balance starts increasing so do my spending habits, for that reason I have multiple savings accounts and only use a local account for bills. I usually make sure to note upcoming bills and create a buffer before doing this; you do not want an overdraft.

An easy way to start this is by keeping your change in a drawer or setting aside $20 at your own frequency. I know this is especially tough for some people here but try not to get discouraged, you’ll get there.



**Tip #13: Medical bills**

Always call the finance department if you land in the hospital, if they can’t lower your bill based on your income, they will at least allow a payment plan.

If something looks wrong on your medical bill fight it, learn to talk their language, speak their terms, understand your rights. I once had a bill go to collections that I fought for months with my insurance company, It went from $1000 to 0 and erased from my credit.



**Tip #14: You don’t need to go to a private college.**

Go to a community college or a public state college or university, it’s cheaper and you’ll come out with much less or no debt. My public university cost around 4K a semester, and through work and Pell Grants I was able to graduate debt free while living at home. No one cares about what college I went to, they just know I’m good at what I do and my experience in the field. Also, buy used books if you can.

Expansion on this tip. (Thanks, u/socialmeritwarrior)



14B: Be smart about college

If you go to college, make sure you're going for something that earns money. Why go from making $12/hr to making $12/hr with $50k debt?



14C: Don't go to college

Go to trade school! Not everyone can hack college. That's OK! Trades can pay very well, and some are in very high demand! Many other users have mentioned getting into sales as well.



**Tip#15: Live at home as long as you can**

If you’re able and willing stay at home as long as possible, this kept my college expenses low and I was able to give back to my family while living at home in the form of buying groceries and doing house chores, my last year of college I was able to start actually saving money that gave me a good buffer once I moved out.



**Tip #16: There’s always a time to move on**

Before I had my child I was pretty happy with my first career job earning an entry-level wage of $14 an hour with $0.25 raises right out of college for a few years, mostly out of ignorance. Then my wife got pregnant and we looked into the cost of childcare. I realized there would be little to no savings per month, and if we’re being honest we’d for sure go negative. It was time to move on. I found a job in my field that doubled my salary after about a month of searching. After a few years in that position the next job search took about 5 days, and my most recent I was head-hunted/poached.



**Tip #17: Never stop looking**

You might be happy with your job, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t look at what’s out there, make it a point to look at openings every month or so to see skills required in your profession or what a senior role looks like in your career if this applies to you.



**Tip #18: Linkedin profile / Resume**

Always keep your LinkedIn profile up to date. I’ve been able to connect with industry leaders, make friends and even get a job all in my field by making sure I have an updated profile. If LinkedIn doesn’t apply to you try having an up-to-date Indeed profile, or do both!

Expansion to this tip: You should always talk about your duties or responsibilities but I find it helpful to also speak to your accomplishments in that specific role. Hiring managers want to know how you can help the company they’re hiring for and what you can theoretically accomplish for them if they hire you.

Note: Have a close family member or friend check your resume, ask for feedback on how it can be improved.



**Tip #19 Re-visit finances occasionally**

Once in a while, double check what you’ve been spending money on, see if you can cut back on eating out or gift shopping if that’s a problem by reminding yourself of what you could have saved. I like to use Mint to see my spending per category. Other people use YNAB (You Need A Budget).



**Tip #20: Disconnect going out from spending money** (Thanks, u/harrison_wintergreen)

You can still go out with friends even if you don’t have money, you don’t need to feel guilty for yourself for doing it either. You can let your friends know of your situation, or just let them know you’re not planning on spending any money and stick to it, if your having a problem with spending, keep your debit/credit card/cash away from you to make the temptation a little easier.



**Tip#21: Quit comparing yourself**

Quit comparing yourself to others, it brings undue stress and there is always someone doing better or worse than you. Life goes at a different pace for everyone. Focus on yourself, if you have trouble with comparing let it drive you to be a better person and reach that next goal.



**Tip#22: Ask questions**

Some people will tell you freely about how they reached success, ask them how they did it, a mentor is a great way to learn and grow!



**Tip#23: Don't give what you can't afford to give.** (Thanks, u/KnowanUKnow)

Try to be low-key about what you do have, because people will come asking. If you do have something to lend, expect it to be gone forever (money, credit \[i.e. co-signing\], items). There is no guarantee you'll get it back.



**Tip#24: Unionize or Join a Union**

I have no experience in this but some users have commented that this should be on the list and I agree. There are always benefits in joining people that have a common cause and your interests in mind.



**Tip#25: Do not squander opportunity.** (Thanks, u/nugdunk

Recognize an opportunity and take it. Everyone's opportunities will be different, it's important to recognize when they are available and take advantage.



**Tip#26: Prioritize your life.**

There are bills that you must prioritize, rent, and utilities are probably the most important. These are things you need to pay in order to survive. Pay them first.



26B: People and time are also a huge priority:

Figure out what makes the most positive impact in your life that's worth spending time/money on. Find out what costs the least to make the most difference in your life. If people are bringing you or your cause down, limit your availability or cut them out. Wasted time and 'wasted' people are not worth it.



That’s really all I have for now, I know this isn’t a catch-all for advice for people in particular situations but I hope this is useful to someone looking to get out of poverty.
