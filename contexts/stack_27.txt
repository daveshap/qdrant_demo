How to get Apple Music on iPod Touch 1G? I own an iPod Touch 1G and I'd like to listen to my downloaded Apple Music tracks on it. However, I can't do that since \"Apple Music songs cannot be copied onto an iPod\" (That's the message it shows me when trying to copy them on there) and I can't enable Apple Music on an iPod Touch 1G.Is there any way to get around that?
