Is there a related term "interactive process" or "Interactive accommodation process" (from the Americans with Disabilities Act) in other laws?
Such as Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities of the United Nations? Or the Equality Act 2010?

Also it looks like in the absence of a disability office, companies or universities refer to a [consultant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_accommodation_process).

Who should pay for the consultant?
