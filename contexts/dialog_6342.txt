GORDO: So that's it...
JAKE: That's it.
LUPUS: King ain't gonna like this.
JAKE: Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
LUPUS: What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
JAKE: Of what? They're both crooks.
LUPUS: Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
JAKE: My fucking heart bleeds.
LUPUS: Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
JAKE: Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
LUPUS: Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake.
BUTCH: So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
JAKE: I was doing it for them.
BUTCH: BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
JAKE: It's not true.
BUTCH: Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
