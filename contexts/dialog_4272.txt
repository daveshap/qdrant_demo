DULANEY: You'll be sorry?
DR. PALEY: I was angry.
DULANEY: You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
DR. PALEY: No -- she asked me about cocaine.
DULANEY: I suggest it never happened.
DR. PALEY: You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
DULANEY: No further questions.
DR. PALEY: I may have been infatuated with her - - but I wouldn't perjure myself.
DULANEY: That's all Dr. Paley.
