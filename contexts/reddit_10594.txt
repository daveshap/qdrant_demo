To my boyfriend
He's done more for me then he will ever know. I was planning to kill myself after school in early June. I planned it for almost a week. When the day came, I was still low enough to go through with it. I was set on it. However, during last period, he said something. He said he wanted to commit the act of falling on a sword (don't remember the word). He's suicidal as well, as well as most of my friends, so suicide jokes are common. What stopped me was what he said after. He said he would've done it already if it weren't for me. This changed my view instantly, and I didn't do it. It made me feel needed, and not completely worthless. The day after that day was actually a bit better, and it stayed a bit better. I haven't been that low since. It's still hard to deal with, but it's more bearable now. If I had actually done it, I would most likely be dead right now. I could never thank him enough, but I'll never be able to tell him. I love him so much.
