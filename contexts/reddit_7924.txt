Only a small number of people actually care about your research.
Does anyone get discourage by the fact that only a niche group of people actually care about your research? I’ve been thinking the last few days that all this time and effort I’m putting in to my research is going to be appreciated by few people. Mostly by those who are in a very similar field of research as me. My research probably will never reach the general public, and even if it did, few would even care.  It just sucks knowing that what I think is super important isn’t important to the majority of others.
