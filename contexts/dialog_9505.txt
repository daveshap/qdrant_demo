TYLER: If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
JACK: I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?!
TYLER: I want to hear the truth.
JACK: Fuck my life. Fuck fight club. Fuck you and fuck Marla. I'm sick of this. How's that?
TYLER: Why do you think I blew up your condo?
JACK: What?
TYLER: Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat! It's not a seminar! You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
