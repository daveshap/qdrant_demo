Unsubscribing because I need real help and this sub isn’t really supportive
Sure some special people get advice and then get upvoted due to crowd upvoting. I’ve posted multiple times and I feel stupid and like I’m screaming into a void. I’d go into what’s wrong but what’s the point. 

Thanks and hope other people have better luck.... they usually do.
