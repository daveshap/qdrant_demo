HUBERT: One minute! Just one minute!
TAYLOR: Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
HUBERT: Horace Mill--!
MCGANN: Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
HUBERT: Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
TAYLOR: Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket. Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
HUBERT: Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
