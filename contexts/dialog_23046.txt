TATUM: Do you believe this shit?
SIDNEY: What happened?
TATUM: Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.
SIDNEY: No way.
TATUM: And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
SIDNEY: Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
TATUM: Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
SIDNEY: Do they know who did it?
TATUM: Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
SIDNEY: They think it's school-related?
TATUM: They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than... Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
