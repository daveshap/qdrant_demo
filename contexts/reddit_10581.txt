My camp was destroyed, I'm going to hang myself
I went into the town centre today to hand my CV into as many places as possible, I managed to get a hot meal from a local church before heading home. 

While I was gone (9+hours) someone had broken into my camp and destroyed my tent with everything inside then lit it on fire...

Karma is a bitch. I deserve this.

I can't do this anymore, I don't have the energy to continue.

I take one step forward and it life sends me ten steps back.

I'm done, I'm ready to see my family again, I'll see them soon.

I'm going to use the spare cord from the tent that wasn't destroyed and hand myself.

This is goodbye, Andrew.
