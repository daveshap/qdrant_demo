TERRY: Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
EDIE: Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
TERRY: Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
EDIE: Why should I come hollering to you at all?
TERRY: Because... because... Listen Edie, don't get sore nowâ€” but I think we're getting in love with each other.
EDIE: I can't let myself fall in love with you.
TERRY: That goes double for me.
