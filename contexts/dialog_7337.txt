SHEPPARD: Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'? That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
SANCHEZ: This is the guy that killed my partner.
SHEPPARD: You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
SANCHEZ: Says here one of our boys brought him down. You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
SHEPPARD: Demolition Man.
SANCHEZ: What's it mean?
SHEPPARD: You never want to find out.
SANCHEZ: Take a look at this.
SANCHEZ: He had a partner. Our own Ray Gallagher. He tagged Wade dangerously defiant. Psychotic. Reckless. Seems our Commissioner didn't like him much. Busted his buns on a narcotic's violation. Wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
SHEPPARD: He went dirty and they made an example of him.
SANCHEZ: But he was such a good cop.
SHEPPARD: They always are.
SANCHEZ: Well I've got news for you. This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
