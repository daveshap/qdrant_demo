I feel hopeless, what should I do to help?
Recently I (F18) have been struggling to pay a medical bill from my car accident. Reapplied for health insurance because I was dropped and got denied because my parents make too much. It's so frustrating when trying to talk to them because it's either "everything will work out" or "don't worry about it because it doesn't affect you", when in actuality it affects me so much more then they know. It feels like I am talking to a brick wall.  I'm just lost on how to feel or what to do. I've been saving up to help with expenses but it is SO hard when I have no job or ways to get places.
