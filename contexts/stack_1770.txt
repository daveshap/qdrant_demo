Wire size question I am trying to figure out AWG from a European/German schematic. The wire is listed as 0,3mm. (That's 0 (comma) 3mm.) I can find wire for sale in this diameter, but I need a reference to AWG. Is anyone familiar this measurement? The circuit is two parallel 807 vacuum tubes. The wire mentioned above is to wind a parasitic suppressor in both of the plates of the tubes. Thanks.
