I GOT ACCEPTED TO COLLEGE!!
I got my first acceptance letter today!!! High school was a pretty shit experience for me. Anxiety held me back and lead to me missing things like football games and prom. It got so bad that I had to get home tutors for two years because I couldnâ€™t even manage to leave my house. For awhile I considered dropping out because I literally believed it was impossible to continue. But I couldnâ€™t be more proud right now. Iâ€™m IN school for senior year, I WILL be attending my graduation ceremony, and I AM GOING TO COLLEGE!!! Hell yeah!!! So if anyone feels like giving up, trust me if I can get into college with my attendance record looking the way it is, you can do pretty much anything.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who took time to share your experiences and congratulations. It means so much and itâ€™s encouraging to no end. You all are such lovely peopleðŸ’™ðŸ’™
