BEN: Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>. I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
JACKIE: Honey, this is Thursday. I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
BEN: And many meatballs.
JACKIE: You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
BEN: Is that like Luigi's?
JACKIE: Not a lot, sweetie. It's a country. Like Canada. Only smaller.
BEN: Where are you, anyway?
JACKIE: I'm somewhere, thinking of you. And meatballs. And you know what?
BEN: Yes.
JACKIE: Of course, you do. Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food. So, all the more meatballs for you. But you know what.
BEN: I did. Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
JACKIE: Do me a favor? Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay? Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
