Thinking about leaving home, need advice on how to do it.
Hi reddit! This is my first post, so I hope the formatting is ok, but here's my story


I'm the oldest of six (F17, almost 18) and the things that have happened in my house recently are pushing me towards leaving.


This started back in early 2018 when my parents took my phone and found out that I'm bi. They took my phone away for a year, screamed at me for hours, set content blocks and DSNs, and then said nothing about it for about two years.


Finally got my phone back just over a year ago and they still try to check/take it regularly, but I've been refusing to let them have it, and it's worked well, but I have just short of a panic attack every time mom asks.


Flash forward to the day before New years, a few days ago at the time that I'm writing this. My mom yelled at me for turning off my phone every time she walks in the room (a coping mechanism that I learned after the last time they took it away), told me that she refuses to pay for a phone plan (the only reason I have one is for driving because I have a poor sense of direction, and so I can call for help if I get stuck somewhere, and I have been trying to use it to get a job, to pay for said plan, car insurance, save up for college {something I don't want, but they do}, and move out). And told me that I was a sinner and evil and going to hell because she thought I was dating a "girl" (one of my non binary friends).


So I've about had it and I want to leave, but I don't know what to do or how to pull it off without ending up dead or something. I have a plan to try and leave on the 21 of Jan, but if things get worse sooner, I might have to speed it up.

What do I do?

EDIT: As of today, Jan 5th, I have decided that I will leave and I'm going to do it next week. I'm going to try living with my friend that I mentioned earlier. Thank you all for your kind words, it really means a lot to me!
