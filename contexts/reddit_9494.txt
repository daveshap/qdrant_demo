Should we make a r/poverfinance recipe book in the wiki? How to eat on the cheap?
When this place was first created, and everyone mentioned moving over from r/personalfinance, someone mentioned how frustrating it was to see someone asking how to save more money on their $100k annual salary when their problem is they have $3.75 in their bank account until Friday and want to know how to feed their family for the next week. 

Should we put together an r/personalfinance cookbook or recipe book of cheap meals we can link in the wiki? Meals for under $5? A quick search on reddit doesn't show any budget meal subs, so maybe create a sub under this one? r/povertyfinancemeals ? Is this something people would be interested in?

ETA: sorry for the typo in the title, can a mod edit?
