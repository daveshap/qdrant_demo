DOC: You're going to have to walk back to the border.
SLIM: Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
SLIM: Hope you get to where you're going.
CAROL: Thanks. Hope you do too.
SLIM: By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
DOC: Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
SLIM: Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
DOC: Go with God.
SLIM: One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
CAROL: Tell her you robbed a bank...
CAROL: Are we going to make it?
DOC: Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
CAROL: Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
DOC: Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
CAROL: I guess we are.
