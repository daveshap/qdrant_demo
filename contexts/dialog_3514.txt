WALTER: Yeah. So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
DUDE: Terrific, Walter. But you haven't told me how we get her back. Where is she?
WALTER: That's the simple part, Dude. When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat it out of him.
WALTER: ...Huh?
DUDE: Yeah. That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly. That's a Swiss fucking watch.
WALTER: Thaaat's right, Dude. The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong. If there's one thing I learned in Nam--
DUDE: Dude.
VOICE: You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar. Do not slow down. Vee vatch you.
DUDE: FUCK.
WALTER: What'd he say? Where's the hand- off?
DUDE: There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out of the car!
WALTER: Huh?
DUDE: We throw the money out of the moving car!
WALTER: We can't do that, Dude. That fucks up our plan.
DUDE: Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter! Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it! That's the beauty of it Walter!
WALTER: Wooden bridge, huh?
DUDE: I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
WALTER: The bridge is coming up! Gimme the ringer, Dude! Chop-chop!
DUDE: Fuck that! I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
WALTER: Okay, Dude. No time to argue. Here's the bridge--
DUDE: Walter!
WALTER: Your wheel, Dude! I'm rolling out!
DUDE: What the fuck?
WALTER: Your wheel! At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out! I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him! The uzi!
DUDE: Uzi?
WALTER: You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
DUDE: Walter, please--
