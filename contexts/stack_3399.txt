Fantasy short story collection, including a fire salamander girl, a were-cougar, an anxious girl turned into a rat, and maybe a half-bigfoot girl So, I'm looking for the title of a short story collection. I'm going to briefly describe a couple of the stories: A fire salamander girl getting stolen and taken to hell, where her creator had to rescue her. A were-cougar (?) has a child with a man and leaves him. I might be mixing up the genders.A modern girl talks with Ganesha and his rat and maybe goes on a ride down a New York Highway with him.A girl with anxiety or something similar is turned into a rat by a Japanese goddess and learns to love herselfAnd maybe (I feel like I am mixing this up with something else) a half-bigfoot girl tries to be human for a while.This book was sold at Ollie's Bargain Outlet a couple years ago, it was kind of thick, perhaps 3 inches wide, and it had a green dust jacket. I believe there was a cougar or perhaps a bear in front of trees with a human next to it. Non-realistic artwork, but well done.
