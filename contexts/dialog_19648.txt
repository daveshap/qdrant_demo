KOPALSKI: Yes, Leon...
IRANOFF: What is it, my boy?
LEON: About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
BULJANOFF: Leon... Leonitchka... Why are you so good to us?
IRANOFF: Leon, my little boy.
KOPALSKI: Oh, Leon, you are so good.
LEON: What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
IRANOFF: Razinin.
LEON: Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
KOPALSKI: You wouldn't like Razinin.
BULJANOFF: He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
IRANOFF: We don't like Razinin.
BULJANOFF: We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
