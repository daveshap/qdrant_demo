For grad students and new professionals - Tell your strategies for professional development
Hey all!

I'm going to be presenting on professional development for new professionals at a conference this school year. 

While I've discussed my personal strategies for professional development, I'm hoping to get some feedback on other ways that people go about it. 

My strategy is highly structured and task oriented, and I know that some folks do not function that way. 

Any and all feedback would be fantastic!
