BOBBY: No Grace, my hand's bothering me.
GRACE: You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
GRACE: Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
BOBBY: You could give me my gun back.
