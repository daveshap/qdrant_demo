I'm too mentally ill to be a "successful" person, but too competent to be a total disaster.
And I almost just wish I was a full on fuck up, you know? It somehow feels worse to sit at mediocrity.

When I entered college, I had elaborate plans to become a surgeon. I had good grades and I was motivated, even though I had been a little beat up by a rough childhood. Five anxiety disorders and two suicide attempts later, I graduated with a GPA so shitty that I will never even hope to be a doctor. Not only that, but my biology degree is useless. Still, the theme among therapists and everyone around me was "at least you graduated!"

Yes, that's what it's come to. At least I graduated. That's totally what I always dreamt my future to be.
