JEANNE: Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
DUNOIS: Yes... they were.
JEANNE: Good. Where are the English?
DUNOIS: Everywhere. Where is the food?
JEANNE: It's coming -- I rode on ahead. I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
DUNOIS: I know...
JEANNE: Good. Can you bring me to him?
DUNOIS: He's on the other side of the river.
JEANNE: So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
LA HIRE: Hey, my friend! I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
JEANNE: La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
LA HIRE: Sorry Jeanne... Did you both meet already?
