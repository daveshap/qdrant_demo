GEORGE: Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
LYLA: I SAID FORGET IT!
GEORGE: Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
BETTY: What do you mean? What did I do to you...
GEORGE: Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
BETTY: David, please --
GEORGE: STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
