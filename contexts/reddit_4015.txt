Don’t Give Up Guys, Keep Trying.
I’m single and it’s been awhile since I’ve been in a relationship. When I’m on this subreddit and I see some people giving up or have no hope, I just want to say don’t give up. If you’re not finding anyone, keep working on yourself and focus on your hobbies. Be good at something and you’ll all of sudden find someone. Sometimes love finds you in the weirdest places. So don’t give up, make sure you are the best person you can be and eventually love will find you. 

I know some people have it harder than others, but there’s really good qualified people who seem to be losing hope. Just be patient, do whatever you can do gain self-esteem and I think before you know it, you’ll find someone.

Have a good day. Take care.
