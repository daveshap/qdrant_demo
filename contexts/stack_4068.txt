Lufthansa & Dolomiti, Europe to Asia I am traveling from Prague to Hong Kong via Munich. It is my first time with transfers and I have no idea about the following.Transfer PRG (Dolomiti) -> MUN (Lufthansa) -> HKTime for transfer (not boarding!) is just 45 minutes. I read some advice (small airport, same terminal, no care of baggage - one ticket), but do I have to pass through security again (I read about transits, but is it also the case  in Munich)?Is it possible to be on time? (I supposed yes, if company offers the ticket).What is your experience with Lufthansa (Economic Basic) and this (or similar) flight?Transfer HK (Lufthansa) -> MUN (Lufthansa) -> PRGTime for transfer is about 6 hours. Could I leave (without baggage) the airport? This relates to the second question:Do I have to claim my baggage? Or does it \"wait\" 6 hours somewhere? If yes, can I reach it?Do I have to declare things like a bottle of alcohol, a mobile phone (200\u20ac) from HK? How much is it away from reality? It seems to me that everybody has something to declare... (I found the EU limit on alcohol is 1 liter. That couldn't be realistic).Thank you very much for any answer on above topics although it is clearly simple for others. I have little experience and I have to be prepared.
