Months, maybe years without my SO
Hello everyone, I am currently feeling not like myself (as a lot of people in this situation do) but i wanted to ask you for help. I am not in my right state of mind right now, and understanding or coping with informations is very poor. I would like to hear your opinion on this, thank you... Due to the Covid-19 outbreak in europe, almost every country now closed borders, including mine. I understand this precautions and their nesessity but I am still very anxious and sad that i won't see my boyfriend for some time... He lives in country right next to mine. It doesn't seem like our cases of covid-19 are severe like in other states, but I heard someting about borders being closed for couple months or years in our country depending on others states. It makes me very confused and anxious. Does it mean we will have to wait for more countries to open borders? That thought makes my already bad mental health worsen.
