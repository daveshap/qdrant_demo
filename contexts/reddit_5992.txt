Can my major GPA save me?
So Iv done pretty terribly throughout college, on and off academic probation, currently have a 2.4. Oddly enough though I actually do really well in the more challenging courses. Iv gotten plenty of Fs and Ds but they are mostly coming from classes like Rec and Leisure studies, nutrition, etc. I just lose interest in that stuff and flunk while courses like accounting and macro Econ I do pretty well because the challenge keeps me engaged. Iv also started medication for ADHD and I’m just blowing through courses easily now, I was getting B-As on finals with little study bringing up bad grades from missed assignments and what not but now medicated I do all the boring stuff, study and the tests are always easy As for me. 

So my question is how bad does this look and with continued success how much does it help. I’m starting 4th year and going to need a 5th to finish. I can probably get 3.5+ on major GPA and maybe list deans list student for 3-4 consecutive semesters. My hope is someone might look at my application and see GPA isn’t great but pulled it together at the end. Is that at all likely?

Finance major if that matters.
