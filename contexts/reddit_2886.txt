Having trouble settling into job roles, keep wanting to leave after less than a year is this normal?
Hello All,

To give some background, I am currently 23 and I've had 5 different job roles in the last 3 years. Not all of these have been change of employer, 2 of the 5 have been promotion/relocation to another team. 

My issue is that I can't seem to find satisfaction with the roles I'm choosing. I work in the IT sector and while I have been moving jobs my salary has increased and I am happy with that aspect of my career to be earning as much as I am at my age. 

However, my current job I have been in for 6 months I am already feeling bored and not challenged enough,same as I felt with my previous role where I stayed for just over 1 year, but had promotion in the middle of that time. When I joined my current role 6 months ago the start was very promising there was lots to do, I was given the freedom to innovate and establish processes which is what I love doing. However now I have finished all the important projects, the system I am responsible for is in a good state and I am left doing the boring day to day maintenance which is the part I dont enjoy. 

As a result I have found myself being attracted by LinkedIn adverts and recruiter emails promising better salary for similar/same job I am doing. Issue is, I don't want to be a 'job hopper'. I understand that it looks bad when you have 4 different jobs in 3 years even if you have been climbing up the ladder. Because of that I feel locked down to stay at this place for at least a year or two before I can allow myself to leave. 

I have tried taking onto new projects but the business simply doesn't have the need or resources to start new projects at this point. Am i wrong for feeling like leaving? should I just be "sitting it out" for another year and a half? If i was to leave because I have had so many job changes how do I deal with the inevitable stigma that this brings?
