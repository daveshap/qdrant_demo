RICK: Are my eyes really brown?
STRASSER: You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
RICK: My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
STRASSER: In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
RICK: Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
STRASSER: Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
RENAULT: Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
STRASSER: I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
RICK: You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
STRASSER: Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
RENAULT: You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
STRASSER: Perhaps.
