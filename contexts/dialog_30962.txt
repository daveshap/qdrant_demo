TOD: There's still a way.
BILL: What do you mean?
TOD: It's me, don't you see. Terry's right, I'm the escape hatch. I disobeyed order.
CHUCK: You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
TOD: They don't know that. We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right? I'm a kid.
CHUCK: But that's not the point...
TOD: That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
DOWNING: Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
TOD: I thought we'd have a better chance if I headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
DOWNING: But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
TOD: Twice.
DOWNING: Is that what you were trained to do?
TOD: No.
DOWNING: Then what do you think he was trying to do.
TOD: Let the blow drive the boat down wind. Neutralize our canvas.
DOWNING: So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
TOD: No.
