Displaying single symbol in legend for proportional symbol layer I'd like to be able to show just one line in the legend for my layer of multiple proportional symbols. Previously, my workaround was to create a secondary layer not displayed on the map, and to bring that into the legend to serve as a \"dummy\" symbol. But now, the client wants a .lyr file with symbology preserved, so I must be able to replicate a single-line legend feature. Is there any way to do this in ArcMap?
