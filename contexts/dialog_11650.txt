MARTIN: Debi's house.
PAUL: Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
MARTIN: No. You drove us here.
PAUL: Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
MARTIN: No.
PAUL: Ten years. What happened!?
MARTIN: I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
PAUL: Thank you.
