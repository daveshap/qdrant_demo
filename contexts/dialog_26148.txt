PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Yes?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the Leper Colony"
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Have you tried the recall again?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Yes, sir. We're still sending it. But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: What's the target.
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how. You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador. Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have. Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: General, stick to the point, please.
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time. A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard --- Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes! He has one hell of a chance.
