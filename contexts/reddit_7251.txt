Just starting a new job with some anxiety
Do you guys ever feel a little too vulnerable at a new job. I’m still training in a project management position but I feel like I may not be catching on quite as fast sometimes and think that my boss regrets hiring me instead of someone else more equipped for the job. 
I assume it’s a normal thought and just want some piece of mind.
