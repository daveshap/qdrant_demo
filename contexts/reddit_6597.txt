Question for people who work physical jobs
So I just started a summer job as a landscaper after graduating college while I continue to apply for salaried jobs and look for a career.

I’ve been doing this for just over a week and I already have got my ass kicked. I come home tired and sore and know that in just a few hours I’ll be off to bed to do the same thing tomorrow.

What do you guys who work physical jobs do to keep yourself in 100%? Im seriously considering buying one of those tubs for my feet and icing them. Maybe some supplements like creatine? I’ve been getting good sleep which helps but shit is still brutal. 

Please don’t think I’m a baby back b*tch for this post lol. I’m not gonna quit and I ain’t complaining, I’m just looking for ways to be less sore and tired all the time.
