Behavior of many PIs has been outrageous during COVID-19 outbreak
I am a PhD student in one of the most prestigious institute in India. The response of many Professors towards their Masters' dissertees and PhD students has been appalling to the point of sickening. Same  reaction has been noted by my and my friends' acquaintances in other institutes. 

Covid-19 epidemic was late to come in India, but it has created an environment full of anxiousness, fear, and melancholy. We are still undergoing stage 2 of the epidemic, and the next 2-3 weeks are deemed to be critical because we can either enter higher stage, where there's a risk of complete shutdown and being away from loved ones for a very long time. Like other parts of the world grad school here is already too tough, work pressure sucks all the life out of you. Comes global pandemic, uncertainty of the outbreak period broke even the strongest among us. Understandably many of us wanted to go home and spend the period of outbreak with our families. But even during this time of duress, PIs are forcing us to work in labs while diplomatically saying that you are free to go home. Many students have suspended their plans to head home because they fear retribution by their respective supervisors once the situation returns to normalcy. Even the director of the institute has refused to take clear-cut stand.

The academia world seems cold and heartless. This incident has made me question whether I really want to be part of such a world. Even the students who have stayed feel miserable and apprehensive about the immediate future.
