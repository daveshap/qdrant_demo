WENDY: Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
SANDY: What are you doing?
WENDY: Just thought I'd stop by.
SANDY: Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
WENDY: Yeah.
SANDY: Are you his girlfriend?
WENDY: No.
JIM: You okay?
ELENA: Yeah. You?
JIM: Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
