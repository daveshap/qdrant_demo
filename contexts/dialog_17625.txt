RONNIE: Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
ROPER: It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
RONNIE: It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
ROPER: Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
ROPER: What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
RONNIE: It's okay. We broke up.
ROPER: When?
RONNIE: Just now.
