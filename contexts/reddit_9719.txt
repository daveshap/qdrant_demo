Does the program matter?
As I finish up my undergrad, I’ve found I have a passion for working with students (as I’m sure everyone who posts here does) and want to pursue a career in student affairs. While I plan to work for a year before going to grad school, something I’ve been curious about has been “does the program matter” when it comes to graduate schools?

When I say this I mean two things: is there a difference between M.Ed, MA, and MS regarding employability? And does the “prestige” of the school‘s program matter in the long run vs how the program itself is structured? For instance in comparing the graduate programs at UGA vs someplace like West Virginia University.
