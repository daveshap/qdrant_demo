What sort of Writing Samples should I curate?
So I've been applying for writing jobs and I'd say 3 out of 5 applications usually ask for a writing sample.  I graduated college with a BA in English back in 2016.  I've been working with a law firm but don't have anything I've worked on outside of College (and my writing has changed since leaving college).  

My plan is to fabricate a few different pieces that I can keep on the side while I work on getting guest spots on blogs, but what should I make portfolio wise? Magazine Ads for Products? HR memos for fake companies?    

I want to get into Content Writing, Copywriting, and Editorial type stuff but at this point I'd be fine with anything writing related and I know spec work isn't ideal but I feel like something is better then nothing.
