Has Anyone Else Feel Like They Have Become Less Intelligent After Dealing with Depression...
Sorry, this is my first reddit post, I'm fairly new to the community. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Like (presumably) a lot of people, I felt as if I was incredibly smart growing up. I was able to start school early when I was younger, I had a near perfect GPA, I painted, I played multiple instruments, and my parents were pushing me to apply for top schools. My future looked really bright.

However, in the middle of senior year (of high school), something felt really wrong, and everything began to fall apart (lol, that sounds overly dramatic...but just know that I really was not in the right state of mind). I couldn't get up to eat, I cried at random times at school, **(warning for triggering visualization? not sure if this would count as one) \*\*** I began to harm myself a lot (like I mostly beat my legs or arms with objects), and I was just deep into depression. I tried to commit suicide multiple times, **\*\***

Like I've experienced periods of sadness before this, but never as intense and for an entire year.

Luckily, I did well enough in school before all of this happened, so I was awarded a scholarship to let me go to community college for freeâ€” so I didn't completely self-sabotage my future. So I've been working on transferring for the past year.

However, I'm so distraught. I feel like my intelligence has gone down the drain. I slur when I talk, I developed a bit of a lisp, I can't coordinate my actions to my thoughts, I even forget letters when writing (for example, I would write "oadside" instead of "roadside" or "mozzera" instead of "mozzerella"). I feel so, so disappointed in myself and it's ruining my self esteem. I even had to say the phrase "I want to know what I originally got on my essay" three times the other day to my professor because I couldn't remember how to say it, and he looked at me really funny.

Is this normal?? Like I said, it's ruining my self esteem completely, and I feel like I'll never be the person I once was. I'm starting to relapse back into my depression because I feel so worthless, and I feel like I don't know what to do. I've tried reading more, downloading cognitive supporting apps (like Luminosity?), and I've been sleeping okay and drinking lots of water. But I don't know. Has anyone experienced something like this and was able to rework themselves back to the person they originally were? If so, how did you do it?

Or am I doomed to plummet even further than I am now...

Sorry if this question seemed pretentious or if I seemed pretentious in any way.
