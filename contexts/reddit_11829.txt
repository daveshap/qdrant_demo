I'm depressed, but have no one to talk to.
I'm 19 years old and I've been pretty depressed for the last few years. It's led to me being pretty socially awkward, and I finally told a family friend and asked for some help. They suggested I talk to a psychiatrist to see about therapy or medication, so I did that and I was diagnosed with Major Clinical Depression and Social Anxiety and prescribed some medicine. I've been to several therapy sessions and I'm two weeks into my medication.

The medication hasn't taken effect yet, and the therapy is slow-going, but ever since I started it, it's sort of 'opened the floodgates.' It's made me want to talk about what's going on in my head more, but I feel like I can't talk to anybody besides my therapist. I'm glad I can talk to her, but I want to talk to someone I have a more personal relationship with, and I feel like it would help more in the long run. I also wouldn't have to wait a week or two to talk every time I wanted to talk to someone for an hour.

The family friend that recommended getting help says I can talk to her, as she's a sort of motherly figure to me, but I can't bring myself to do it. I feel like it would make this a very one-sided relationship. She has her own family and her own stressful things to deal with, so talking to me about all the depressing thoughts that are overflowing in my mind would just bring her down, especially because she wouldn't be able to actually help with anything other than by listening.

I'd probably write more, but my thoughts are kind of cluttered right now. I don't really expect much help for this. I just wanted to get it off my chest. I've got about a week before my next therapy session, so hopefully this will make things a little easier. Thanks.
