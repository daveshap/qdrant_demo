Warning to anyone that hasn’t started school yet
I’m a senior just like the majority of you guys. I’m taking 3 APs, 2 regular classes, and have an off. I’ve only been in school since last week + yesterday.

I’m already struggling to find time for college apps, and my fall sport and homecoming activities haven’t started yet.

So if you don’t start until September or whatever, START YOUR ESSAYS. You seriously won’t have time during the year.
