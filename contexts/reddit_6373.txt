One half of my mind wants to give up on trying to find work the other half doesn't....
It's honestly effecting me emotionally and I know there's other people out there that are struggling to. It's honestly making life not worth living for, that's how bad I'm getting. I don't know what to do, I've already applied for 7 places, been rejected, done work experience at one place which was 2 months ago....

I just don't fucking know anymore.... i'm getting frustrated to the point where I'm actually punching holes in my bedroom door. I'm trying to control my anger and frustration but shit is it hard. 

I'm pretty much fucked right now. No one will hire me and I'm starting to give up on it all. I've got my l's at the moment and doing driving lessons. I just can't see my self ever getting work.
