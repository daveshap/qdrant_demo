Short story about giant alien insect building a man-suit Astronauts discover 'God' on the far side of the moon. There's a giant highway with trucks running on it constantly, but no one is allowed onto it. Someone sneaks onto a truck and finds out that there's a giant alien insect of some kind, and the trucks are carrying parts for a giant 'man-suit' or something.I have no other details I can provide. Hunting for this story for more than a decade now. Any suggestions appreciated.
