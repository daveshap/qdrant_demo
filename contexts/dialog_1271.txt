STIFLER: You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
OZ: Dude, watch me work. They go for sensitive studs like me.
KEVIN: This is your plan, Finch?
FINCH: Yep.
KEVIN: This. Right now.
FINCH: Uh-huh.
JIM: You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
FINCH: Mochaccino. Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
KEVIN: Of course, Finch. What?
FINCH: Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
KEVIN: What are we gonna hear?
FINCH: You'll see. Gotta go. Sixteen minute round trip.
JIM: Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
FINCH: When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
