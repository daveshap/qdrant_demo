Can I continue my save on a new switch with a new game copy So my dad has a switch which I managed to briefly use to play breath of the wild. However, recently he's decided to never let the switch out of sight so I'm thinking of saving up for my own console and copy of the game. The problem is that I want to continue with my progress that I made on his copy. Is there any way that I can get my save file onto a new switch with a new cartridge for the game?
