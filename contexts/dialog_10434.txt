HAMILTON: General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
WASHINGTON: And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
WASHINGTON: Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness. It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
HAMILTON: With pleasure... and an honor. Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
WASHINGTON: That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
HAMILTON: But it's what he said, just before they killed him: I regret that I have but one life to give to my country.""
