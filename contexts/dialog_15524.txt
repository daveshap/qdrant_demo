YNYR: I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
TORQUIL: The Widow of the Web?
YNYR: Yes.
TORQUIL: That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
YNYR: She has the power of vision.
TORQUIL: She has the power to kill.
YNYR: Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
TORQUIL: Her name is Death.
YNYR: She had another name once.
COLWYN: No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
YNYR: There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
COLWYN: Yes.
YNYR: He has come for Lyssa.
COLWYN: Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
YNYR: Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
COLWYN: Can she be forced?
YNYR: No. She must agree of her own free will.
COLWYN: Never.
YNYR: You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
COLWYN: Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
YNYR: Yes.
