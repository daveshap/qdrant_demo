Connect 3 Lithium Polymer battery with different capacity in parallel I am working on an IoT product with has a total current requirement of 1.3 A at the peak. Due to space constraint, we decided to select Li-Po battery with capacities one with 600 mAh other two with 350 mAh each and the voltage rating is the same 3.7V. to get total 1300 mAh we are connecting them parallel.Now we are looking for a charging IC which will support this parallel configuration with different capacities and same voltage rating Li-Po batteries. How can we solve it?
