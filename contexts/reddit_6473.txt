Employer is very interested in me, but has a hiring freeze until mid Feb. What does this mean and what should I do?
I’ve had several rather informal interviews for a dream position with a dream company in the entertainment industry. 


The person interviewing me is an acquaintance of mine and he’s been very transparent and informal about the process. I’m now the only person being considered for this role, I’d be working directly under this acquaintance of mine, and he has given me every reason to believe they plan to hire me. Although I am still young and likely naive to these situations, he has said they are “very interested” in bringing me on to the team. 


The only issue is they have a hiring freeze in place until Feb 15th. The company has experienced massive growth over the last few years and they’re currently restructuring the department I’d work in. I haven’t been given any information on what the hiring freeze actually means for me.


My question is: Is this a red flag? What does a hiring freeze imply about the state of the company (from everything I’ve researched, other than the freeze, they seem to be doing exceptionally well)? Should I just continue to move on and apply for other jobs?
