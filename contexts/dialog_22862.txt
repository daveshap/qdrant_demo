REIBEN: Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
MILLER: Yeah, how so?
REIBEN: I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf. Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off? And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
MILLER: There's to be a bright side, look for it.
REIBEN: Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for? Cheese. The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France. There is no bright side.
MILLER: There's always a bright side.
REIBEN: I'm listening, sir.
MILLER: Well, I, for one, like cheese.
