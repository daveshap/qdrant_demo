Money Problems
My family has always had month problems. I don't know what to do at this point though. I can't afford clothes I need for winter, and I don't have anything that i need. I can't find a job, and my parents are trying their hardest. EBT keeps lowering our benefits, and we barely have enough money to buy food with. I'm stuck. Any suggestions?
