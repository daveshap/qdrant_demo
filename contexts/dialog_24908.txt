GRACE: Hello?
THEO: Hello, mom?
GRACE: Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
THEO: I found dad.
GRACE: He's dead, isn't he. Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
THEO: Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
GRACE: You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
THEO: I gotta go. Love ya mom.
ALFIE: Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.
THEO: The pin machine?
ALFIE: Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
