It won’t let me cross post but I just want all of you to understand what you’re up against. There are a good chunk of professors who will take your lack of knowledge about their own work lives as a slight against them, who view your letter writing as a burden, and who generally think that treating you with unprofessional contempt is acceptable.

I’m not posting this to have a debate. I’m doing it so that you can know that you’re not alone if this happens to you, to help you strategize approaching your letter writers, and to help you understand just how big of an ego many professors have.

Note there are a lot of them chiming in to support the student as well. Academia is a mixed bag of personalities but many treat humans as disposable. Know what you’re getting into, because this is not unusual.
