AUNT EM: Seventy -- Dorothy, please!
DOROTHY: Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week. And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
AUNT EM: Dorothy! Dorothy! We're busy!
DOROTHY: Oh -- all right.
UNCLE HENRY: Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
AUNT EM: I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
UNCLE HENRY: Yes.
AUNT EM: Oh, I hope we got them in time.
UNCLE HENRY: Yes.
