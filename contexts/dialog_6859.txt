ANNETTE: No, not at all.
SEBASTIAN: Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
ANNETTE: I'm... I'm alright.
SEBASTIAN: How was your date?
ANNETTE: It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
SEBASTIAN: Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
ANNETTE: Wait, don't hang up.
SEBASTIAN: Okay?
ANNETTE: What are you doing?
SEBASTIAN: Reading.
ANNETTE: What are you reading?
SEBASTIAN: Of Human Bondage.
ANNETTE: Somerset Maugham.
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
ANNETTE: You're not gonna start that again.
