Having a astoundingly hard time leaving retail
To begin with...

A year ago I had a job working in an office and I LOVED IT and was good at it. Got laid off. Over the last 7 years I have worked in retail on top of that and since that lay off had to go back to full time retail. I just absolutely need a career change.

I am going back to school for Paralegal Studies after nursing school didn't work out, but I can't even seem to find an entry level position in the legal field in my area. I have work ethic, I'm motivated, I show up and do my darn best everyday. I take feedback and try to improve everyday.

I've taught myself to use intermediate excel, word, and outlook functions. I'm fantastic with customer service and building connections and have been recognized by my company several times and by  customers.

I've had just rejection after rejection lately, or I am getting an interview right away, going through several interviews, then being rejected.

I have limited income to spend money on getting certified in Microsoft products, etc.

Beyond building a portfolio I'm so unsure of what to do. I've been trying since mid December to find work.
