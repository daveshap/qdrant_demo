MIKE: Hi.
BRUNETTE: Hi.
MIKE: I'm Mike.
BRUNETTE: Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
MIKE: Like the quiche?
BRUNETTE: Yes. Like the quiche.
MIKE: I like quiche.
BRUNETTE: I thought real men don't like quiche.
MIKE: My reputation seems to have preceded me.
BRUNETTE: Why? You're not a real man?
MIKE: Not lately.
TRENT: It's on...
SUE: ...it's on.
BRUNETTE: ...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
MIKE: Just like that?
BRUNETTE: Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
MIKE: How was it hard?
BRUNETTE: Well, I left someone very special behind.
MIKE: Tell me about it...
BRUNETTE: You too?
MIKE: Yeah.
BRUNETTE: I thought I was going to die.
MIKE: It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
BRUNETTE: Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
MIKE: It does.
BRUNETTE: How?
MIKE: Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
BRUNETTE: Like what?
MIKE: What what? What advantages?
LORRAINE: You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
MIKE: Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
TRENT: It's on.
SUE: ...it's definitely on.
BRUNETTE: What else?
MIKE: What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
BRUNETTE: To do what?
MIKE: I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
BRUNETTE: Anything?
MIKE: Anything.
BRUNETTE: Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
MIKE: Uh, if the guy wants to.
BRUNETTE: You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
MIKE: Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
BRUNETTE: Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
MIKE: No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
BRUNETTE: Mike...
