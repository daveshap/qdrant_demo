TREVOR: Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
LARRY: A little? Try unbelievably.
TREVOR: I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
LARRY: Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
TREVOR: Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
LARRY: And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
TREVOR: How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
