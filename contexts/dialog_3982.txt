WOMAN: ...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
MAN: Uh-huh.
WOMAN: ...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
MAN: Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
WOMAN: Yeah...
WOMAN: ...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
MAN: Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
MAN: ...What're you gonna do in Houston?
WOMAN: I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
MAN: I told you. I like you.
WOMAN: See, I never knew that.
MAN: Well now you do.
WOMAN: ...Hell.
