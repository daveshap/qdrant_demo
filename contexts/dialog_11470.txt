CHAUFFEUR: And what are you going to do?
BARON: The pearls are in her room.
CHAUFFEUR: Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
BARON: I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
CHAUFFEUR: You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
BARON: I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
CHAUFFEUR: Need any help?
BARON: No.
CHAUFFEUR: Have you got that skeleton key?
BARON: No --

BARON: How?
CHAUFFEUR: Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...

BARON: I don't like your tone.
CHAUFFEUR: No --
BARON: Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
CHAUFFEUR: With the pearls?
BARON: With the pearls --
