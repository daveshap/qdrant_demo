Dont you hate when you wake up and know its going to be an anxiety day?
So much is changing and I don't like change, I also don't like confrontation. There's both right now in my life. My husband is starting a new job today and a teacher at work has some stupid beef with me for making a joke. I'm having a hard time dealing with it all at once, it feels like I can't breathe

Any tips would be greatly appreciated
