If I get accepted to a school and reject a spot in their class early, do I help out my deferred classmates?
I got into UMich EA but one of my friends got deferred and its his number one choice. I got into Stanford EA, and even though I do want to keep my options open to other places, It's really not fair of me to keep the application in if it hurt his chances like that. I was wondering if I deny the admission would I help my friend's chances
