BA in Philosophy, ~5 years work experience at law firm accounting dept., what next?
Feeling stuck/uninspired, currently making \~60k as a Legal Biller in a Law Firm (sort of like Accounts Receivable specialist, but I work with ebilling programs a lot). There's no ladder to climb and you're either a biller or the supervisor years down the line. I'm not sure how I can ever start making "house and family" type money living here in Chicago with this job.

I was always a good student, 3.9 GPA graduating DePaul University with a BA in Philosophy, but I have a pretty big motivation/lack of passion issue. The only thing that seems to really interest me in life is physical fitness/health, and even though I'm dedicated and have built a good body, I'm still a smaller dude and along with injuries, I don't think I can make a career out of that passion. 

Is there any good options to maybe get a Masters in something, or just switch job fields to something that fits my experience? I'm down for any ideas. I know law school sort of fits, but since I have no debt currently, I don't relish the idea of putting my self 100k+ in debt to enter an over-saturated job field where it seems new associates have to sign their life away to ridiculous hours at a corporate firm, or choose to take a job that doesn't pay much more than what I'm currently making lol. It would definitely tap into my lack of motivation issue, since once of my biggest fears is feeling like I'm wasting effort. My job probably doesn't need to be fulfilling, I'm very comfortable with my life outside of work, almost too much so because it makes me shy away from longs hours working etc.
