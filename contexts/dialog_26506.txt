LOIS: Your bookie?
CLARK: No.
LOIS: I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
CLARK: Actually, she's silver-haired.
LOIS: Not...gray.
CLARK: Not really, no.
LOIS: Are there any more at home like you?
CLARK: Not really, no.
LOIS: Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
CLARK: I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
LOIS: Some people aren't the athletic type.
CLARK: But otherwise it's swell.
LOIS: 'Swell.' When was the last time I heard anybody say - where are you from , anyway?
