"You choose who you want to be with" - Dating advice from my therapist
I started going to therapy recently and the subject of dating is a usual topic. I just wanted to share what she said because it made me think. Here's what happened.

So I asked her "How do you meet people nowadays?" she chuckled a bit and said "I get that question a lot. Some people are great. They're intelligent, educated, good personality but they just have a hard time meeting people due to the nature of society nowadays (work first over personal life)."

I told her about my exes and 'my perfect boyfriend', I asked her if it was too much to ask for someone like that. She said "Well, I'm not saying it's impossible but it'll be difficult." then I said "Okay, well I think I need to put myself out there more. Put myself in a position to meet this person."

This is the part that hit me. She responded "That's no guarantee either. You could go on a dating app and date 10 guys but none of them will be the one. You could go to classes and hobby groups but the chances of meeting someone is like 50/50. Even if you do meet someone you like, there's no guarantee they'll like you back. You can't control them."

And then her advice was to just focus on things you can control, which is working on yourself.  When I started talking about "the one" or "the one I'll be compatible with" she was kinda shaking her head and she said "We just choose who we end up with... so do you want the funny guy who isn't handsome? The handsome guy but is boring? Etc..."

I think what she was trying to say is that no one is going to be perfect and if we hold out for that person it'll be difficult and beyond our control. We're all just imperfect humans and we just choose which other imperfect human to be with.

So from this I'm somewhat changing my mindset about dating.

Anyway, would love to hear your thoughts on my therapists advice!
