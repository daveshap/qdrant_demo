What is the term for an argumentative style that relies on immediately extrapolating or threatening worst outcomes? For example \"You don't want to see the Jumanji sequel?!? I'm filing for divorce.\"\"The soup is cold? I'm throwing dinner in the trash.\"\"You're buying a house in Harlem? I predict your kids will grow up to be transients and drug addicts.\"etc.Is there a term for this?
