BRUCE: He's dying. And I can't deal with it.
DICK: But he's never said a word-
BRUCE: You know Alfred. He'd never say Anything. But I can tell. Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had. Without him, I don't know how I would have survived. He saved my life, Dick. And I've never told him.
DICK: Talk to him, Bruce. There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
BRUCE: I'm scared, Dick. Maybe for the first time in my life. I'm really scared.
