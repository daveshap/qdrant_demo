KAT: The Partridge Family?
PATRICK: I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.
KAT: Good call.
PATRICK: So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
KAT: I dazzled him with my wit
PATRICK: A soft side? Who knew?
KAT: Yeah, well, don't let it get out
PATRICK: So what's your excuse?
KAT: Acting the way we do.
PATRICK: Yes
KAT: I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
PATRICK: So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
KAT: Something like that
PATRICK: Then you screwed up
KAT: How?
PATRICK: You never disappointed me.
PATRICK: You up for it?
KAT: For. . . ?
