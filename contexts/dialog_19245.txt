LEE: Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
DUFF: No thanks, Lee.
LEE: It's just that I hate empty rooms.
DUFF: Sure.
LEE: Well, what're you going to do?
DUFF: I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
LEE: Going back, huh?
DUFF: That's right.
LEE: They'll run you out.
DUFF: No, they won't.
LEE: How 'you gonna live?
DUFF: I can always chop cotton if I have to. If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
LEE: No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
DUFF: Okay.
LEE: Don't be too hard on him.
DUFF: Hell, I'm just like him.
LEE: I know he wasn't much of a father.
DUFF: Who is?!
LEE: Good-bye, Duff.
