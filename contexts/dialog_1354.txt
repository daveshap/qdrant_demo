CLARK: The depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. You thought they were your friends. Why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
DICKSON: Aw, they've gone crazy. You can't reason with a mob.
CLARK: No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
DICKSON: So, that's it, eh? You've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you? Well, I'm not going to resign now - or ever.
