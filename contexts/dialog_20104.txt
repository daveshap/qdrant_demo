CASEY: Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
ZACK: Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you. Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here! No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
SID: It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
ZACK: But she expects you to marry her?
SID: She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
ZACK: So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
SID: I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
ZACK: Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
SID: But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
ZACK: Do you know that for sure?
SID: It's mine.
ZACK: Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
SID: No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it Zack
ZACK: Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
