JUDGE: That's it...? Come on, guys...life is too short... You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it. Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
GALVIN: ...things change.
JUDGE: ...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
GALVIN: I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
JUDGE: And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself. I myself would take it and run like a thief.
GALVIN: I'm sure you would.
