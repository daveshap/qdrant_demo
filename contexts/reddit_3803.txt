Just got stood up, basically..
I was supposed to meet up with this girl for drinks at 3pm. Around 2:10pm, she texts me asking if we can do 4 instead. Already could tell she had crappy time management skills, hah. I agreed to meet up at 4. I get to the bar and there I am waiting for ONE hour for her to get there. I keep checking with her to see how far she is and she keeps saying “10 minutes”, “sorry almost there”. At the end, I texted her “I’m leaving soon” then soon after, walked out and blocked her number.

This has never happened to me but I shouldn’t have waited like an idiot for that long.

Only spend your time with people who respect it.

Bad dosage of online dating for me today haha



****EDIT (07/06): wow, I wasn’t expecting this post to take off. Thank you everyone for your feedback and for sharing your experience(s). It’s much appreciated. 

Yesterday was a big lesson for me. I now have a decent idea on how to spot someone who’s disrespectful of someone else’s time.
Overall, my experience with online dating has been great so I will keep on going.

PS: I wish I could reply to everyone’s posts but I have a pool and some sun waiting for me on this nice holiday weekend. Salud.
