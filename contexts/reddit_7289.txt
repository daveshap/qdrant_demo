I got a job but have no previous experience, trying to learn but it’s hard
Originally this job posting asked for at least 5 years in administrative experience. You know how many I have? 0. None. I still got the job.

I think I only got it because I was an intern at this organization for 2 summers. I only applied for this job because I didn’t think I could get a job anywhere else. I wasn’t actually that interested but felt like I had no other choice. I spent the last year sending out job applications and only one interview. Well, two including this job.

But since I have the lack of experience, they kind of expect me to do things I have no knowledge about. I’m not being thrown to the sharks, but I’m really not confident in anything I’m doing. This job is completely different from my internship, which was all research-based, and I didn’t have to talk to many people all day, which was my favorite part.

It’s just all really new to me I guess. I also have horrible social anxiety and that doesn’t help. the people there are sort of helpful but my job is different from their job. I’m supposed to be the expert on this stuff and I have no expertise. I just feel lost, but maybe I should still feel this way since it’s only my second day of work.

I just wanna know if anyone has had experience practically being thrown into doing tasks that you didn’t know much about and were basically told to “figure it out yourself”
