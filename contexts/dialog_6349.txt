JAKE: He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
LUPUS: Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
JAKE: That was fucking deep.
KING PIN: Speak.
LUPUS: He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
KING PIN: So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
LUPUS: I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
KING PIN: Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
JAKE: What's up with you? Bladder infection?
LUPUS: Keep it up.
LILY: You got my cell. Leave a message.
JAKE: It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
LUPUS: You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool.
JAKE: That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
