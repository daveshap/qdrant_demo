KATHRYN: Honey... you all right?
MIKE: No.
KATHRYN: Are you scared?
MIKE: Yes.
MIKE: Damn it!
KATHRYN: Hi, baby.
MIKE: Baby goddamn scared me to death!
KATHRYN: They just wanted to say hello.
MIKE: ... Friggin' fish.
MIKE: Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
KATHRYN: That's a lot of ground to cover.
MIKE: I know, I built it. I've just never seen it this way.
SEAN: Well, I needed a cold shower.
KELLY: Come on! Check this out!
KATHRYN: It's romantic down here.
MIKE: Oh, yeah. Very.
KATHRYN: You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
MIKE: Let's not talk about that now, okay?
