CLEMENTINE: Joel? It's Joel, right?
JOEL: Yes?
CLEMENTINE: I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
JOEL: That's okay.
CLEMENTINE: My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, that's okay" to me. That was nice of you."
JOEL: It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
CLEMENTINE: Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just... Take care, then.
JOEL: Probably see you at the book store.
CLEMENTINE: Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
JOEL: Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
CLEMENTINE: No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
JOEL: You're sure? It's cold.
CLEMENTINE: I don't want to take you out of your way.
JOEL: It's okay.
CLEMENTINE: Yeah?
JOEL: Where do you live?
CLEMENTINE: You're not a stalker or anything, right?
JOEL: Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
CLEMENTINE: You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
JOEL: I'm not a stalker.
CLEMENTINE: You know Wilmont?
JOEL: Yeah.
CLEMENTINE: Wilmont. Near the high school.
CLEMENTINE: Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
JOEL: It's okay. I didn't think you were.
CLEMENTINE: So you like bookstores, huh?
JOEL: I like to read.
CLEMENTINE: Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
JOEL: Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
CLEMENTINE: The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?"
JOEL: Sort of, um...
CLEMENTINE: Remember? And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..." Oh
JOEL: What?
CLEMENTINE: I'm just a bit of a wreck. I sleep in your hat" makes me cry. Me."
CLEMENTINE: Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
JOEL: Well, I wouldn't want to be --
CLEMENTINE: Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that. Anyway. See Ya.
JOEL: Take care.
CLEMENTINE: Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
JOEL: Um --
CLEMENTINE: Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
