I keep getting depressed at night
More often than not, I'm fine during the day. Sometimes not, but generally, it's okay. But then it gets to like 10pm, and I just feel screwed up.
I alternate being depressed, and lashing out at whoever crosses my path. I've said some really mean shit during these times, and I have the memory of just not caring at all. I don't know what to do.
