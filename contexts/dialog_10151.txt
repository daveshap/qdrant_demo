VICKI: Why didn't you tell me?
JESSICA: I was going to, I was going to tell everyone. I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon. Is Steven around?
JESSICA: Does he know about what happened?
VICKI: Yeah. Sit down a second. There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
STEVEN: Well?
RANDY: I'm sorry. I have to bring you to a cell.
STEVEN: Are you crazy?!
RANDY: I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
