Nightmare Start-up founder....
I'm working in a start-up at the moment and the company founder is literally the worst possible leader

This is just scratching the surface 

- Changes direction of company and product offering on a dime, causing mass confusion 
- undermines me in front of the employees i manage (they still like and respect me but still)
- Late in everyday, barely works, has about 3464 pointless meetings a day 
- expects things to be done in completely unrealistic timeframes 
- Doesn't like being asked questions by myself or other senior positions as he wants us to use our own digression but then is incensed when our visions don't align 
- Disliked by pretty much the entire company (25+ people) I have yet to chat to anyone here who respects him 

I'm staying becsuse I like my team and the salary is competitive but in all my years this guy is the worst leader I have ever worked under. How can I improve this situation.
