Cards Against Humanity purchased land between US/Mexico border, What are the ramifications of this?
Cards against humanity sold 150,000 plots of land to people online stating:
> weâ€™ve purchased a plot of vacant land on the border and retained a law firm specializing in eminent domain to make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for the wall to get built.


I am curious as to what the actual ramifications of this are. Will this impede the construction of the wall in any real way? Just curious if someone with knowledge on the subject could break this down. Thanks
