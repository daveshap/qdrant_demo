Sometimes there are days when it sucks to be alone.
I am alright with being alone, but sometimes there are days that I wish I would be with someone. Those days I feel like I wish I could find someone so that we could go on a walk with a dog on weekends. I wish I could find someone to go on a ice cream day on a weekend. I wish I could find someone to binge watch Netflix cuddling in the couch. I wish and I wish. 

It just sucks those days being alone. Thought of not meeting someone makes me miserable sometimes.

If anyone is in this same scope, how do you cope with this?
