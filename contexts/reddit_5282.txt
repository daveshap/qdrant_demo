Is working too efficiently actually a bad thing?
Hey! I'm a 25 year old at the beginning of my career and I'm starting to feel like working too efficiently is actually a bad thing. Everyday (particularly when I first started this job), I would come into work and feverishly tackle all of my tasks in the most efficient way possible. Eventually, this led to me finishing my tasks way faster than my peers who were doing the same amount of work, but spreading it throughout the whole day by taking breaks, surfing reddit, or staring blankly into space.

Of course, I thought this would lead to greatness, but actually it seems to have caused me trouble. Because I finish earlier, I constantly end up having to take on other people's work and help them. I didn't mind this when people seemed appreciative (or my boss recognized that I was going above and beyond), but now it just seems like I'm expected to do it.

Perhaps the worst part, though, is that I usually leave at 5ish because I've finished everything. My coworkers end up leaving at 6 or later because they still have work that they procrastinated on. Because of this, it looks like they're working harder/longer (especially because my boss seems to value how long you sit at your desk over how much work you actually get done).

I really feel like being efficient hasn't paid off in any way. I'm curious to see if anyone's had a similar experience!
