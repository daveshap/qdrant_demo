Looking for thoughts and info on Slippery Rock's dual program in Student Affairs and College Counselling
Program: http://www.sru.edu/academics/graduate-programs/student-affairs-in-higher-education-with-college-counseling-master-of-arts

Context: Im entering my senior year of undergrad with a degree in Communication Sciences and Disorders.

I have never seen something like this before. Im starting to fall in love with it. Its a 3 year program that is essentially a student affairs degree merged with a clinical counseling degree. I dont know the logistics and if it is counted as a degree in both? Im really passionate about mental health in college students. Its the reason I got into student affairs and want to pursue it as a career. My only concern with the program is financial-- Ive been looking into full tuition waivers and housing positions because Im not sure I can afford the debt-- and everyone and their mother says a student affairs degree isnt worth paying for.

What do you think? Any experience with this type of thing? Im just trying to get all the info I can.
