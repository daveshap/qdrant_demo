$443 
Today I spent $443 out of my savings account.

My savings account now has $272 in it.

Why? Medical bills to stop it from going to collections after receiving no notice because someone authorized paperless on my billing. If I didn't have these savings I'd be in collections. 

Please. This is just another reminder. Even if its $10. Savings are important.
