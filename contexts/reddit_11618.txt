I wish I could truly hate everyone
People tend to be fucking assholes. Either that or I'm so paranoid that I interpret innocuous events as personal attacks on myself, which is pretty likely. Either that or I just naturally don't get along with others.

If anyone is even a little rude, I tell them to get fucked. I spent a good part of my life trying to be good to people and getting fucked over again and again, so if you think it's okay to just start treating people badly I'm going to tell you 

Fuck, I don't know where I was going with that. It seems even more paranoid and self righteous than it did in my head. I'm not some crusader for justice. I'm someone with a short temper and I'm just frustrated with the world.  I want to believe that I'm enlightened and better than everyone else but I'm part of the problem too. 

I don't do well socially is all I wanted to say. I can never tell if someone is just being sarcastic when they say something good about me. I can't hold a normal conversation because my train of thought is so fucked up and convoluted that nobody can understand what I say.  And when they can't, I get frustrated and tell them to go fuck themselves.

The worst part is that I feel guilty. I don't want anyone to suffer. I just can't handle people myself.
