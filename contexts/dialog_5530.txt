TOMMY: Fergus!
FERGUS: You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
TOMMY: You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
FERGUS: That's wise, Tommy.
TOMMY: All right, then. I like to be wise.
TOMMY: So what do you need, Fergus?
FERGUS: Need to go across the water.
TOMMY: Do you now.
FERGUS: Need to lose myself awhile.
TOMMY: Aha.
