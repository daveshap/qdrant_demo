The reality that my life dream isnt going to happen is beginning to sink in
So this is going to be a long post, so sry. I'm a 15 yo male and a junior in high school and I've been inspired by Steve Irwin since I was a few years old. It's been my unchanged dream to live in Australia and work in wildlife conservation. But I'm starting to realize that its never going to happen for a few reasons. I can't afford to get any decent higher education, my dad is very rich but I'm basically not his kid anymore since I chose my mom over him because he was physically abusive and he told me to never expect a dime from him. I'd consider myself to be somewhat bright, I make straight A's in average classes, but there are kids who are ten times smarter than me in the higher classes and they would get a scholarship over me in a heartbeat. Right now I'm looking at a steady job as a coder, it pays well and is pretty easy work. But I know that that won't make me happy and that being a conservationist is what I've always wanted. I've always thought about how lucky people like the Irwin kids are who were bound to get my dream before they were old enough to want it. I've been so depressed, but it's not like I hate myself it's the fact that I hate what my future is looking like. I know everyone has big plans when they are young but I really wanted this more than anything.
