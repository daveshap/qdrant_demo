For those who worked at a grocery store is one aisle per day to slow?Am I gonna get fired for it?
Hey guys I've been working on this grocery store for almost 2 weeks now.I'm still facing atm (usually after 3 -7 days of facing everyone gets transfered to filling duty)bc the owner told me that he really likes how I do facing and he thinks that Im doing a great job at it thats why he only wants me to do facing but he also told me that he just hopes that in the near future I could be even more faster.Now I asked one of my co workers about it he told me back when he was doing my job (He's on filling duty now) he was able to do 3 aisle per day.This kinda got me scared bc now I'm thinking I might be way to slow and I might get fired bc of it.This is my first job ever and Im starting to enjoy it.Thanks in advance for the advice and thoughts.
