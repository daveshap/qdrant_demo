How do you say \"take away from someone else\"? I am not a native speaker of English. I want to know if there is a verb that means \"take away something from other people\". For example: If you say I take it away do you understand that (in most cases) you take something away from other people? Removing it from the other person?Is there a better verb than take away?In Spanish the word is quitar. In most cases it means \"from other\".
