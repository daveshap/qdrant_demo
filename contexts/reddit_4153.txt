First date with someone new in 3 years...
Just wanted to share a wholesome date I had last night. We (21M & 19F)  matched on Tinder AND Bumble a week ago and I got her FB and Snapchat the next day, then set up a date for yesterday, Thursday. We literally sat talking in a pub for like 4 and a half hours non stop. We were meant to go see Captain Marvel but we both completely forgot until it was too late and just decided to keep chatting. And surprisingly she bought the first round, despite me saying I'd pay for it all. We really only had like 2 drinks each, spent the whole time talking. We both live nearby so we walked the whole way back until we had to part ways. I tried to kiss her but she said "Nope, I don't kiss on the first date, even though I really want to", so she knows her self worth and knows how much I actually want her. After refusing to give up on a dead relationship due to being afraid to get back into dating, a month afterwards I already had a great date that I'm happy with. Guess I just wanted to share my experience with anyone who is in the same boat as me and afraid to leave a relationship/get back into dating cause they're afraid of not finding someone. If it happened for me, it'll happen for you guys too.
