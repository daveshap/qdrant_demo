WILL: Is he awake?
SANDRA: He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
WILL: Mom?
SANDRA: Yes?
WILL: Did you and Dad have any other property?
SANDRA: I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
WILL: So you never bought any land.
SANDRA: Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
