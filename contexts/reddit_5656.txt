I’m an engineer by education but I have to find a job desperately, what if I turn to recruiting agency “A” and it finds me a job , say, as a receptionist at company “B” will I have a chance to become an engineer at the company “B” in the future?
I’m an engineer by education but I have to find a job desperately, what if I turn to recruiting agency “A” and it finds me a job , say, as a receptionist at company “B” will I have a chance to become an engineer at the company “B” in the future? 
Or will I be able to apply as an engineer to the companies that recruiters applied for me for the position of a “receptionist”?
