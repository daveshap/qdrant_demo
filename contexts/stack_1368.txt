Why collector current is small in value in saturation mode? Why is the collector current smaller in value when a transistor is in saturation mode of operation? My guess is that although both the junctions are forward biased, the (forward) currents are 'opposing' each other and hence the net current is a small value. Is this explanation true? And if not, why is it so?(The comparison of current in saturation mode is being made with the current in active mode for an NPN transistor in CE configuration)
