How do I tell my mom I want to go to a concert?
How do I tell/ask my mom I'm want to go to a concert with my boyfriend and friends? 
So I'm 18, and I want to go to a halsey concert that is a few days after my 19 birthday which is happens to be a few weeks after I graduate. I want to go with a few of my friends to see her and then go camping or something with my boyfriend and said friends. I plan on paying for my own ticket and my friends will pay for there own and we will be driving our own vehicles and all that. But I dont know how to tell or ask her politely so my mom wont flip out that I wont be under her watch for a few days.
