ED: Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit. And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
GEORGIE: Tits.
ED: No. Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!
GEORGIE: Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick. I don't make major motion pictures. I make crap.
ED: Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
GEORGIE: Yeah. Crap with a star.
ED: No! It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>. The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
GEORGIE: Fine, maybe you're right. But it doesn't friggin' matter. I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
ED: What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
GEORGIE: Who?
GEORGIE: Lugosi?
ED: Yeah! <u>Lugosi</u>!
GEORGIE: Isn't he dead?
ED: No, he's not dead! He lives in Baldwin Hills. I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
GEORGIE: OUR picture?
ED: Uh, yeah. Our picture.
GEORGIE: Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
ED: Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
