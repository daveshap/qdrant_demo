Does anybody else feel mentally ill with chronic anxiety?
I know it is a mental illness in itself but I’m talking about constantly feeling “off”.. like way less intelligent than you used to be, hard to process your thoughts in to words so they come out jumbled or silly sounding, constant headaches and just feeling like you’re on autopilot looking in to someone else’s life.. Idk I’ve been dealing with this for 2+ years and I still find it hard to believe it’s just anxiety. I’m terrified it is something else that the doctor’s are missing which I’m sure is just anxiety fueled hypochondria lol.
