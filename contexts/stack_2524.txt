Creating line from existing point in specific compass bearings using QGIS? I am trying to measure the distances from points in the ocean to land and these distances need to be measure from the point at different compass bearings (i.e. every 5 degrees). I am using QGIS V2.18.21I am working from an estimated central location of London array, Longitude 1.4950, Latitude 51.6270. I would like to understand how to measure the distances from this point to the coastline, which I have as a vector polygon layer, at a every 5 degrees on a compass.
