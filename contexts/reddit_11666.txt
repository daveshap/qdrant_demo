People who cant entertain themselves.
I live in a house with other adults and it just really reminds me how annoyed I get with people that cant entertain themselves.  They consistently come up to me and say what are WE doing today, or I'm bored. I do like to hang out with them, I mean I liked them enough to agree to live with them. Its just I dont want to always hang out every waking moment. And I'm trying to work in my studio on my art but I consistently keep getting knocks on my door asking what are we going to do?  Do these people not have interests?
