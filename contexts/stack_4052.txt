Staying with relatives in UAE for one night \u2014 appropriate visa? I hold German citizenship, and am traveling from Germany to India. I'd like to visit relatives in the United Arab Emirates, which would work out nicely with my itinerary, but I'd stay over night in Abu Dhabi.Is a transit visa sufficient here?
