RAJA: Do we have to?
SHOVELER: I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
FURIOUS: Have you ever seen him?
SHOVELER: How could I see him if he's invisible?
FURIOUS: Good point.
RAJA: And there's the Sphinx.
SHOVELER: The who?
RAJA: He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
FURIOUS: Sounds good.
RAJA: No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
