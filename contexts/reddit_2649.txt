Is it in poor taste to leave your current job for an hour to go interview at another job?
Disclaimer: my current job is a temp job and contracted to end September 30th, so my job hunt is real right now. I just scheduled an in-person interview at an office about 2 miles away from my current office. Of course, it is during business hours. Will my boss understand my request to leave and go interview, or is it still in poor taste/unprofessional? How else can I handle interviews during the workday?
