SAM: I told you, I quit.
VINCENT: Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone. How about you? I thought all you IRA types smoked.
DEIRDRE: Only the stupid ones. Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets. Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
VINCENT: So where do you go from here?
DEIRDRE: I don't know. I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
VINCENT: I'm up for that...
SAM: Not me. You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
DEIRDRE: Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
