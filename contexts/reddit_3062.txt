My man bun killing my job interviews?
Is my man bun and short beard really hurting my chances while being interviewed. Iâ€™m 42-been in sales and marketing for over 15 years. Just decided this year to grow the hair and facial and business has disappeared. I need to know if I should just tow the line and go back to my old conservative look.
