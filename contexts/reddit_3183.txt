Got offered a position in my company. Boss tried to back out of offer and give himself some wiggle room. What should my next move be?
I'll try to keep it short. I'm currently an analyst at my company and was offered a logistic management position by my director. What prompted this offer is someone in my department got a promotion, and a different employee would be taking that man's job, and I would be taking that second employees job. I was excited for the new opportunity. The move is lateral in my company but it would of been something new with more money. Today around noon my boss (director) and a manager that works for him had a closed door conversation. Afterwards he approached me and the conversation went like this. He initially tried to say the offer was not set in stone, and that he thinks I would be better in my current role because this is a better fit for my intellect. That a different opportunity would happen down the line and that would be a better fit for me. He wanted me to agree with this but I kept it short and just said if that's what you think is best. Then he started to backtrack the first part of the conversation and say that he knows what he said to me sounded like this was set thing. Then. He tried to convince me on how a lateral move like that would not benefit me that much and tried to then complement me on how great I do my current role and that next level opportunity will come sooner than later. I am livid right bow because I can say with certainty something happened where one of these other folks spilled the beans about the promotions and someone got heated that I would be getting a promotion they wanted. So now my boss is backtracking my promotion but neither of the other two employees. What should I do here? Yes I'm going to be looking for new work, but what should I do here at my current job to mitigate this.
