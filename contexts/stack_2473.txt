What does the extent mean when the map is rotated? QGIS 2.18.I have put a map into print composer and rotated the map clockwise by 45 degrees by setting \"Map rotation\" to 45 (it's what the client wants!).I'm struggling to get the region I want into the print composer.What do the extents (X min, Y min, X max, and Y max) mean when the map has been rotated?Or if that isn't a sensible question, how do I move the portion of the map that is shown in print composer? I need to move the map down and left in the rotated view (or equivalently move the window up and right).
