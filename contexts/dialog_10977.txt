NARCISSUS: You brought the army into Rome.
QUINTUS: I was summoned.
NARCISSUS: It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
QUINTUS: It's my job to keep my job. And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard. Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
NARCISSUS: Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
QUINTUS: You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand! Narcissus, the Republic is dead. You think those Senators could govern? For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
NARCISSUS: Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
QUINTUS: The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want: A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues. You know, messy... thinking. They want a dictator! As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of: being you! A famous gladiator!
