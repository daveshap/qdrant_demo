laundry realization
I've been washing most of my laundry by hand for the past several months. It's a hassle wringing it out and so I still had to use the machine for bulkier stuff like towels cuz I can't wring those out well. 

It finally dawned on me it doesn't have to be an all or nothing thing - I don't have to use their dryer. The machine does a great job wringing things out - they're almost dry out of the washer. My apartment has a laundry room, so it's easy to just use the washer, bring the clothes home and use my drying racks to air dry them. 

The savings aren't huge but it's like every third load is free, plus I save the time I'd been spending doing hand washing.
