UTAH: I say we call it in. Get some backup. But you gotta do it. Harp won't listen to me.
PAPPAS: Sure. No problem. I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious. Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
UTAH: I say we don't call it in. Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
PAPPAS: Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay? We cover the bank, whatever. You and me. That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
PAPPAS: Time for lunch.
UTAH: Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
PAPPAS: That place up the street has meatball sandwiches. Get me two.
