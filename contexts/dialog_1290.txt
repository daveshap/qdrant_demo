JIM: Hold on. You have no idea why I'm angry?
MICHELLE: Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
JIM: Yeah, that's pretty much it.
MICHELLE: I thought so. Because, one time? I was at this --
JIM: What was your name again?
MICHELLE: Michelle.
JIM: Okay. Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
MICHELLE: Really? You seriously want to go with me?
JIM: Yes. Seriously.
MICHELLE: Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards? That would be so cool.
JIM: Whatever you want.
MICHELLE: Cool! We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
