I'm not a student but I love research, I have papers ready to go and I want to work and publish these papers. How do I go about doing that?
Is there anyone that has a similar experience? I regret not using my undergraduate work while I had the chance to publish these papers I wrote up in my spare time now and I wish I could go back and research because it felt so fulfilling to do it now. 

I know that if I can publish some papers I can make my grad school application look even better and get some experience in grad school type of research!

**EDIT:** Fields are Statistics and Economics.
