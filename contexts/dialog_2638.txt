DELACROIX: We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
DUNWITTY: I'm wid it.
DELACROIX: I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right. In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial. I have never really dug deep. Not anymore. As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way. Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder. If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
DUNWITTY: Go on. Good so far.
DELACROIX: I know you're familiar with minstrel shows. They came about at the turn of the 19th century. It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air. Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
DUNWITTY: Word!!!
DELACROIX: So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
DUNWITTY: The name of the show?
DELACROIX: It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
DUNWITTY: I'm lovin' it. You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
DUNWITTY: I'm feelin' dis'!
DELACROIX: It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air. In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
DUNWITTY: Don't worry about that, that's my department. Now who do we cast? We need a star. Can Whoopi sing or dance?
DELACROIX: I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
DUNWITTY: Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose? Which one is Mantan again?
