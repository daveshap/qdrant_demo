JUDY: I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
SCOTTIE: You can.
JUDY: No, you wouldn't let me. And I don't want to go...
SCOTTIE: Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
JUDY: I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
SCOTTIE: No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
JUDY: You don't even want to touch me.
SCOTTIE: Yes. Yes, I do.
