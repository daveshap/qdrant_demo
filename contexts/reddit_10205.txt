Ive attempted suicide and my goodbye letter was shown to everyone
Hey.. so just like it says in the title, ive attempted suicide but failed obviously.
Well i was in a coma for a few days and i wrote a letter for my little sister to explain to her why i did what i did.
Little did i know, that letter would be read by everyone! And i mean everyone. I woke up and a therapist was beside me and the first thing she said was that she read my letter. I was so shocked and couldnt say anything for 3 seconds or more. Apparently she thought i didnt believed her so she just quoted the most disturbing and private part of it to me. My mother and all the people in the hospital read it too. 
I had to get into a clinic for one month and no surprise they all knew what i wrote in it.. i felt so shitty because these was personal stuff i didnt want to share with other people!!!
