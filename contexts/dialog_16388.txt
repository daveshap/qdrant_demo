PILAR: Wow.
SAM: Yeah.
PILAR: How come it feels the same?
SAM: I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
PILAR: So what are we gonna do about this?
SAM: More, I hope.
PILAR: How long have you lived here?
SAM: Two years.
PILAR: There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
SAM: Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
PILAR: Like your story is over.
SAM: I've felt that way, yeah.
PILAR: It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
SAM: Pilar--
PILAR: Yeah?
SAM: What was your father's name?
PILAR: Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
PALOMA: She finally got in--
PILAR: It's Saturday.
PALOMA: You got in late last night.
PILAR: Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
PALOMA: Can I get this?
PILAR: Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
PALOMA: I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
PILAR: Enough with the clothes--
PALOMA: Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
PILAR: I only went for my last two years.
PALOMA: How come?
PILAR: Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
