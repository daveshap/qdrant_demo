BEVERLY: The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
PICARD: But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
BEVERLY: As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
PICARD: Dying?
RIKER: He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
PICARD: Can anything be done for him?
