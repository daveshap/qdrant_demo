MOTHER MIRIAM: A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
AGNES: It's not that... it's not that...
MOTHER MIRIAM: What do you mean?
AGNES: It's not my time of month.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Should you see a doctor?
AGNES: I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened. I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
MOTHER MIRIAM: For what?
AGNES: I don't know... I don't know...
MOTHER MIRIAM: That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
MARTHA: When was that?
MOTHER MIRIAM: The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
MARTHA: Sister Paul?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
MARTHA: No.
MONSIGNOR: Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
MARTHA: Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
MONSIGNOR: Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
MARTHA: What does this have to do with..?
MONSIGNOR: And you had a sister who died in the convent.
MARTHA: Who told you this?
MONSIGNOR: Do you still go to church?
MARTHA: What business is it of yours..?
MONSIGNOR: Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
MARTHA: Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
MONSIGNOR: But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
MARTHA: I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
MONSIGNOR: Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.
MARTHA: Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
AGNES: I'm not sick.
MARTHA: But you're troubled... aren't you?
AGNES: That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
MARTHA: And you're unhappy.
AGNES: Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
MARTHA: Agnes...
AGNES: Answer me! You never answer me.
MARTHA: Sometimes, yes.
AGNES: Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
MARTHA: What did you do?
AGNES: I'm always bad.
MARTHA: What did you do?
AGNES: I breathed!
MARTHA: Agnes. What did your mother do to you? If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you? Did she make you do something you didn't want to? Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it? Did it embarrass you? Did it... did it hurt you? What did she make you you do?
AGNES: No...
MARTHA: You can tell me.
AGNES: I can't.
MARTHA: She's dead isn't she?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: She can't hurt you any more.
AGNES: She can.
MARTHA: How?
AGNES: She watches... she listens.
MARTHA: Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
AGNES: She...
MARTHA: Yes?
AGNES: ... makes me...
MARTHA: Yes?
AGNES: ... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
MARTHA: She tells you you're ugly?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: And that you're stupid?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: That you're a mistake?
AGNES: She says my whole body's a mistake.
MARTHA: Why?
AGNES: Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
MARTHA: How does she know that?
AGNES: Her headaches.
MARTHA: Oh, yes.
AGNES: And then...
MARTHA: What?
AGNES: She touches me down there with a cigarette. Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby any more.
MARTHA: Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
AGNES: I'm afraid.
MARTHA: Please! I want to help you. Let me help you.
AGNES: Alright.
MARTHA: Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
AGNES: No I'm not.
MARTHA: Are you pretty?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Agnes, you're stupid.
AGNES: No I'm not.
MARTHA: Are you intelligent?
AGNES: Yes I am.
MARTHA: You're a mistake.
AGNES: I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
MARTHA: Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
AGNES: Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
MARTHA: I really love you.
AGNES: As much as Mother Miriam does?
MARTHA: As much as God loves you.
ELDERLY NUN: I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here. There was blood on her hand that night.
MARTHA: Agnes? Who? Mother Superior?
ELDERLY NUN: ???
MARTHA: What?
ELDERLY NUN: Look into the convent records.
MARTHA: Sister...
