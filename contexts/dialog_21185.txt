DRISCOLL: Got a moment, Inspector?
KILLAINE: I've got a year. Or a second. I'm not sure which.
DRISCOLL: You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
DRISCOLL: We've done that. He's a San Francisco private eye. Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E. Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it. Goble and Greer is the firm name.
KILLAINE: Swimming with his hat on? That's original.
DRISCOLL: If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
KILLAINE: I understand. Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
DRISCOLL: I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business. Greer won't give out.
KILLAINE: I'd suggest a telegram. Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco. A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction. His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction. Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist? Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police.
DRISCOLL: Send that?
KILLAINE: Would you?
DRISCOLL: If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
KILLAINE: Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
DRISCOLL: How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
KILLAINE: The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had. I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize. What you think is important--I think is important.
DRISCOLL: Thanks, Inspector. What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
KILLAINE: Men like you don't need orders.
KILLAINE: Time for a little chat?
BRANDON: If it doesn't take too long. Drink?
KILLAINE: Thanks. I don't mind.
