Looking for anyone who works in student leadership development
Hi r/studentaffairs,

I work at a smaller university in the Midwest, and I'm working to revamp/recreate our strategy for student leadership development outside the classroom. I have some ideas after a lot of reading, but I'm curious if there's anyone here who works in a similar capacity who can share what you've found to be effective or what your institutional approach is for developing student leaders. Or maybe if you know of another institution with a great model, or some relevant literature, that would be great too. Would love to have a conversation in the comments, or you can send me a message! Thanks.
