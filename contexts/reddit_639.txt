My crush is touching me even though he has a girlfriend
Okay so the boy I like has a girlfriend. His girlfriend is in another school, so they only see each other in their free time. The thing is, when I’m at school, he touches and leans against me A LOT. I don’t know if these are signs, or what those are. Some things that he does are:

When we are sitting on the ground or next to each other, he tends to lean his thigh agains mine so they touch. He often puts his hand behind me, so he is closer to me. I move away from him and he follows.

When I walk by him, he sometimes rubs his hand against my thigh. He does it discreetly, but I see it. Also he sometimes just grabs or *gently* slaps my thigh.

We don’t really talk too much anymore, but he has asked me and said that we are friends with benefits to me, and quickly brushes it off my saying “I’m kidding”. Once he asked if I was a virgin (yes) and if I wanted to wait until I was 16 (also yes) and he said to me “I’ll wait for you”. 

It’s not like I get uncomfortable from these things, I mean he is my crush. I just don’t understand if he is doing it on purpose, or if he is doing it without realizing. I want him and his girlfriend to break up, but I also don’t want to break them up, if that makes sense. I just need advice; is there a possibility that he is doing that on purpose? Does he like me, or is he just mocking me? If he likes me, should I go for him?
