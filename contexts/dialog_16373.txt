SAM: Field trip?
PILAR: Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
SAM: Want to take a walk?
SAM: Your mother still doesn't like me.
PILAR: I can't name anybody she does like these days.
SAM: I see she built a place up here by the river.
PILAR: A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
SAM: She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
PILAR: So she tells me three times a week.
PILAR: I thought you got through that pretty well.
SAM: They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
PILAR: People liked him.
SAM: Most people did, yeah.
PILAR: I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
PILAR: I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
SAM: Yeah.
PILAR: Weird what you remember.
SAM: Your boy, there--
PILAR: Amado.
SAM: Nice-looking kid.
PILAR: He hates me.
SAM: No--
PILAR: With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
SAM: Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
PILAR: Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
SAM: It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
PILAR: So why did you come back here, Sam?
SAM: Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
PILAR: You don't want to be Sheriff.
SAM: I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
PILAR: It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
SAM: You've got your mother, your kids--
PILAR: They've got me. Different thing.
