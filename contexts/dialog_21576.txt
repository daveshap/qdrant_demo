SAM: Where'd you go to college?
LILA: I didn't. I got a job, too. I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me? Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
SAM: She was willing to lick the stamps.
LILA: I wonder so many things about her now. Why she never told me about you... Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
SAM: We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
LILA: Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
SAM: This is the old highway.
LILA: I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
SAM: Watch your tenses.
LILA: Huh?
SAM: She always tries to be proper.
LILA: You going to wait here for me?
SAM: I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
LILA: We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
SAM: You won't believe it... But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
LILA: I believe it.
SAM: I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
LILA: Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
