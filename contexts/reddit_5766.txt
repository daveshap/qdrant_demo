I finally got a job after MONTHS of interviews
After numerous in person and phone interviews I finally got good news this morning! My background check cleared and I start work Monday morning! 

I interviewed with this company about three weeks ago, and got the news that they were going to follow through with me a week after that, and this week they were doing my background check ( which for some reason I was freaking out about even though I’m clean except for some speeding tickets). I’m excited to finally work again after not working for the past 5 months. You guys are the first to hear about this since nobody knows yet ( not even my husband). I didn’t want to tell anyone just in case I would jinx it or something but I can finally let people know now! 

For those that are on the job hunt don’t give up! Keep applying and sending out those resumes. I know it’s hard especially when you have a family that’s depending on you. I’m fortunate enough to have a great husband who’s income is more than enough for us to live comfortably with, but I know it was still hard for him.  I send you all good thoughts and good luck on your job hunt!
