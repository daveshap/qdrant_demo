Immuno-compromised without realising it =/
So, I've just spent 3 weeks in isolation, going slowly more crazy each day. Just before this pandemic kicked off my wife walked out on me and took both our kids with her.

So for 3 weeks I've been unable to see my kids, and I won't lie I was pretty god damn ill for most of it, it wasn't covid-19 but it was nasty.

I finally start to feel more me and better, called the doctors Friday as due to return to work today, they asked me to come in this morning as they needed to speak to me.

I go in thinking this is just routine with me having been ill etc, only to find out I should have been locked in my house the moment lock down was announced as I take two different Corticosteroid based medications.

GP has advised me that I have next to no immune system due to the medication I am on, and as one of them is for my lungs, I would end up critically ill if I contracted covid.

I was so happy to finally be able to return to some sense of normality and go to work and possibly look to having my kids ASAP, and now I'm absolutely heart broken and panicking like mad. 

I went to the super Market on Friday as I was feeling better and desperately needed food etc as did my cat, and now I'm scared to death that I've picked up something from someone there and I'm going to end up alone in a hospital bed.

This is so so difficult cause I can't even go to a relative for support, I know I can call them, text them or whatever but I just want a god damn hug before I break down..

Sorry I just really needed to get this out and couldn't do it on usual social channels as its too personal and don't want everyone I know knowing how much is going on.
