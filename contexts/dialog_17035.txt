DOYLE: Zydowski. It's about time.
ZYDOWSKI: You won't like this. I ran the prints from the house. No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
DOYLE: Yeah?
ZYDOWSKI: Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
DOYLE: What? Wait a minute -
ZYDOWSKI: That's not all. According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
DOYLE: That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball. Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
