NAPOLEON: Yes -- what is it?
JOSEPHINE: Open the door. It's me.
NAPOLEON: Go away -- I'm busy.
JOSEPHINE: I know what you're doing in there.
NAPOLEON: Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
JOSEPHINE: Where is Madame Trillaud?
NAPOLEON: How should I know. Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
JOSEPHINE: What are you doing in there?
NAPOLEON: Oh -- now, this is absolutely ridiculous! If you don't want to be humiliated in front of your guests, you will return to the table at once.
JOSEPHINE: Will you be joining us, soon?
NAPOLEON: I will be there in five minutes. Go back to your guests.
JOSEPHINE: Five minutes.
NAPOLEON: Yes!!
JOSEPHINE: Five minutes.
NAPOLEON: Goodbye.
