1v for non-inverting op-amp input I need to reduce 5v to 1v for use as a reference voltage in an op-amp.What would be the best way to do this? The simplest solution to me is to use a voltage divider, although I understand others have reservations about this.Alternatively, a voltage regulator of sorts, although a quick Google, Mouser, Digikey, Farnell search yielded very few results...Ideally I'm looking for a basic, and easy to understand solution.
