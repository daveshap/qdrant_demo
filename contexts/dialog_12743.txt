BRENNA: William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
TAUPIN: Yes.
BRENNA: And you are William Taupin, aren't you?

BRENNA: You're using your son's name.
TAUPIN: No. Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to. When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
