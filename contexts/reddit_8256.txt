There EPA relaxed the smog threshold from 0.7 to 1 part per billion. Is this a harmful increase in pollution or a relaxing of too strict standards?
I recently saw [this article](https://www-m.cnn.com/2018/10/31/politics/epa-air-pollution/index.html) with a message that Trump's administration is allowing more air pollution by increasing the threshold for smog from 0.7 to 1 part per billion. However, the debate over EPA regulations is more complex than simply minimizing pollution. Trump has asked the EPA's acting head to ["provide regulatory relief to industry while protecting air and water quality"](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1K12NB). His administration has also [focused on weakening the most expensive regulations.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/climate/epa-trump-mercury-rule.amp.html)

In this case, is Trump's administration cutting burdensome regulations while maintaining an acceptable level of environmental protection? His administration has been [cutting or relaxing many environmental protections.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/climate/trump-environment-rules-reversed.html) Have the economic benefits outweighed the environmental negatives?
