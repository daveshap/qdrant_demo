EMBRY: I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse. We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
ERIN: Did he say why?
EMBRY: Nope. And I didn't ask.
ERIN: Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
EMBRY: Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind. So yeah, I took a look.
ERIN: And ...?
EMBRY: There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation schedules, the like. But then there were a few memos about the holding ponds. The water in them. They had readings from test wells, stuff like that.
ERIN: And you were told to destroy those?
EMBRY: That's right.
EMBRY: Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
ERIN: What do you mean?
EMBRY: Well. There were a few documents that I somehow didn't get around to shredding. That I kept instead.
ERIN: How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
EMBRY: At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college. I can't afford to lose my job. I told myself I was being honorable. But there's nothing honorable in what I did. Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
ERIN: Hey, Ros, where are they?
ROSALIND: In the conference --
ERIN: Morning!
ED: Erin? What are you --
ERIN: You know what, Mr. Potter? I completely forgot your birthday this year. And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight. So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
