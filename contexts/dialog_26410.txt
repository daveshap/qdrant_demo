SUPERMAN: How you doing down there?
GUS: Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
SUPERMAN: Hey, you're perfectly safe.
GUS: I ain't about to argue with you. What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
SUPERMAN: That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
GUS: Watch out for them air pockets!
SUPERMAN: No, we're just going down.
GUS: We gonna crash?
SUPERMAN: I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
GUS: We back in Metropolis?
SUPERMAN: No...I just have a little stop to make.
GUS: Whatcha wanna stop here for? Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
SUPERMAN: Just a second.
