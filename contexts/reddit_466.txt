How do I get over a crush I don't want?
Throwaway because paranoid. TL;DR at bottom. Sorry for any errors spelling, or otherwise, it's late and I'm very tired right now. On mobile so.. yeah. So I(M17) recently met someone at work (I work at a coffee shop if it makes any difference) and I tried to deny it at first but I'm pretty sure I'm crushing hard. She's attractive, nice to talk to (when I'm not being awkward lol), funny, and just fun to be around. Don't even know if she's single and that makes it worse but I'm not gonna try and find out y'know? I'm 99.9% sure she has no interest in me at all but our first actual conversation, like not work talk, she told me a couple personal things you normally don't tell someone so fast and some minor things that would be hints at best. Honestly she's great but I just want to get over her I guess, for multiple reasons

1. I've never been in a relationship before and quite frankly, terrified of the Idea.

2. Legitimately don't know if I'm even ready to be in a relationship. Kind of coincides with no.1.

3. Probably the most Important thing is that I work with her and I don't want to make things awkward for myself or anyone else.

4. I'm pretty sure I don't even want a relationship right now, I like the pace I'm at right now and would like to go my own way for now.

5. I'm at a semi-pivotal point in my life right now and I need to focus on myself both mentally and physically.

All that aside, I still can't help but feel this way, I can't help it and it's driving me a little crazy. I just want to stop feeling this and just get over her but I don't know how. So Reddit, what do I do?



Sorry for the rant and any unnecessary info. Any advice helps. I think writing down why I want to be over this helped a little so that's good. Thanks for reading if you did. Might post this on other subs idk.



TL;DR, I have a crush on this girl I met and for a multitude of reasons I just want to get over her already. Any advice helps.
