HENRY: Thank God your fever broke. Slowly, now. Just a sip. I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
VICTOR: A... week?
HENRY: We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
VICTOR: Is that your diagnosis?
HENRY: Mine and Professor Krempe's. We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
VICTOR: You've been going round-the-clock?
HENRY: We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
VICTOR: Everything in moderation, Clerval.
HENRY: Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
HENRY: It's the down-and-outs I pity most. Those who can't fend for themselves. They'll be dead by the thousands before this is done. They don't stand a chance out there.
VICTOR: No. They don't.
HENRY: Victor. This place looked like a charnel house. What went on here?
