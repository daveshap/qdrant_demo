JIM: Well, thanks for coming.
X: You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba. What can I do for you?
JIM: Just speculating, I guess. How do you think it started?
X: I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia. As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia. Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
