Broke up with ex-girlfriend of 6 years. Never will get closure or reconciliation.
I broke up with an ex-girlfriend of 6 years a few months ago. I left her because I highly suspected she was cheating on me. I do not know this for sure, but all the suspicious behavior was there.

- She had stopped wanting to have sex with me. I had asked to start using Condoms because we had a bad close call with an unwanted pregnancy but that's not a good reason for no sex.

- She had started guarding her laptop and cellphone with her life, and would get upset if I even glanced at the screen when she was on facebook.

- We never went to bed at the same time anymore, and all of a sudden she always needed space, she was complaining I was always around.

- I been told that when you confront a cheater, they blow up on you, and my ex had quite a temper and would become very angry that I "accused" her of cheating.

- She would accuse me of cheating on her all the time, and I also heard cheaters will do this to cover their own guilt.

- She had been hanging out with this male friend more towards the end, and putting on make-up and stuff, plus working out more. 

To me it seemed she had moved on, and I kind of don't blame her, I had waited too long to confront a trauma disorder issue I had which caused me to quit jobs and break-down a lot.

However, I wish she had been more unfront about it, and until this day she denys she cheated, and I would have been more apt to believe her, and even apologize for accusing but, she never even tried to talk to me about it.

Anyways she texted me today after not speaking for two weeks, and I thought it was going to be the start  of working things out, but instead she told me to stop talking shit about her. I do not even know what she is talking about because I do not talk about her on facebook, with mutual friends or to her. 

If she does come up, its in brief passing. I don't know I am crushed because I really miss the woman, but in the end she still has the same flaws which is the inability to remain calm and solve a problem.

Why I am attracted to her, I do not know, but deep down I miss my best friend very much, our relationship may have been shitty but she was still the person I loved to spend my time with the most.

I just wish she confronted her issues, the way I did mine.
