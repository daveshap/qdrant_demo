Need help with importing Camera Roll images from iPhone to Mac I\u2019m trying to pull images off of my Camera Roll on my iPhone 6s with iOS 11.2 to my Mac locally and not using iCloud as I won\u2019t sign up for that. I would like to use the Image Capture program or iPhoto, but I've also tried using the Dr Fone programs too and all of them say that my iPhone has a password lock on it and they can\u2019t access my iPhone when it's connected via USB cable. However, I have no password active on it.The only thing that I can think of is that when I first bought the iPhone it asked me for a Passcode during the first initial set up and for some reason this main Passcode is preventing me from accessing the photos through my Mac.Can this be correct? Or how else can I get access to empty my camera roll locally onto my Mac?
