BOBBY: You think I'm a fake.
CATHERINE: I think it's what you think.
BOBBY: No, it isn't what I think.
CATHERINE: Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
BOBBY: Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
CATHERINE: I don't think that's accurate...
BOBBY: Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
CATHERINE: I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
BOBBY: It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
CATHERINE: I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
BOBBY: Some bath oil?
