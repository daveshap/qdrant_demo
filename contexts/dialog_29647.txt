EDDIE: But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
SHU: I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
EDDIE: But why?
SHU: Maybe... because someone's afraid.
EDDIE: Afraid of what?
SHU: I don't know. The truth, maybe.
EDDIE: -- About what?
SHU: About Chinatown. What went down.
EDDIE: What went down?
SHU: You tell me, man.
EDDIE: No. You tell me, Shu.
SHU: How can I tell you what I don't know!
EDDIE: You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
SHU: I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
EDDIE: Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
