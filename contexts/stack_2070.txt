Are there English contrep\u00e8teries apart from this one ? Do you know the difference between a nun in a church and a nun in a bath ?This sounds as a nun joke, it is not.Well, in church her soul is full of hope...Then you let your audience figure out the rest. This is art for connoisseurs, and you're not meant to give it away, but since I think most English speakers miss this without knowing, here it is:Her Soul is full of Hope...Her S-ole is full of H-ope... This is rude, and meant that way, go on...Her H-ole is full of S-opeHer hole is full of soap.There are thousands of such humorous blasts, hidden in French literature, passed like farts in too stiff dinners by bored gentlemen sharing a laugh in private, published weekly in \"L'album de la contesse\" the dedicated section of \"Le canard Enchain\u00e9\a satirical and political weekly read by the establishment.Now my questions are : Does that exist in english ? Is it even possible beyond a few examples ? What's it called ?
