BEVERLY: Are you saying they won't help us?
PICARD: I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.

PICARD: Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
WORF: I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.

WORF: There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
