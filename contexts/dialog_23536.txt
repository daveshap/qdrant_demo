HUGO: It was some guy called Brian.
JULIET: Did he sound upset?
HUGO: A little bit. Is that good or bad?
JULIET: It's an improvement.
HUGO: Shall I answer it?
JULIET: No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
HUGO: Working nights?
JULIET: I'm a doctor.
HUGO: And he's a patient of yours?
JULIET: No. But he needs treatment.
HUGO: For what?
JULIET: A certain weakness.
HUGO: The human condition.
JULIET: You know about it?
HUGO: I write about it?
JULIET: And that's not the same thing?
HUGO: No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
ALEX: Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
JULIET: He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
