MRS. ROBINSON: Hello. Get me the police, please.
BEN: Where is Elaine?
MRS. ROBINSON: I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin. Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him. Are you armed? No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
BEN: What have you done to her?
MRS. ROBINSON: I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
BEN: You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
MRS. ROBINSON: I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
BEN: What the hell have you done?
MRS. ROBINSON: Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
BEN: I'll find her.
MRS. ROBINSON: I don't think so.
