Relationships are temporary, be it friendship or romantic relationships. I feel so alone and I can’t grasp / hold on to anything because they always just go away at the end. It’s so painful to live I don’t wanna see another day. I feel like I’m living inside a game that I can’t quit.
We are all alone, you are either aware of it or you are not.
