HEATHER: It's why the witch kills children.""
NICK: I thought all witches were benign and good.
HEATHER: Not this one.
HEATHER: I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
ANNA: I don't...I don't understand them myself.
HEATHER: Try, please, Anna--
ANNA: --bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
HEATHER: What do you mean?
ANNA: A coward too. That's why she had to go.
HEATHER: What happened to her, where did she go?
ANNA: Don't know--just that she was afraid--
HEATHER: --Anna--
HEATHER: What, are you alright?
ANNA: My eye, is there something in my eye?
HEATHER: Not that I can see.
ANNA: Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
HEATHER: No.
ANNA: Closer.
HEATHER: Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
COTTER: Anna's the witch.
NICK: What the fuck's going on here?
HEATHER: Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
NICK: Why?
HEATHER: Does she, goddamnit??
NICK: Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
COTTER: Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
NICK: Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
