Shy guy asking out shy girl update. Now been going out for about 2 months now :)
So I posted on here about 2 months ago asking for advice on how to ask out a shy, anxious girl I'd been talking to and even though only 3 people commented they helped me in plucking up the courage to finally ask her out and lone behold she said yes, We have been dating for about 2 months now. These last 2 months have been the best time of my life and she has also said she has been the happiest she has been in a long time.

I just want to say thank you to this sub reddit for giving me the courage to finally ask her out.
