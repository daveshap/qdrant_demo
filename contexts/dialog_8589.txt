LEWIS: But he isn't us. He's your own kind.
ZIRA: He's a gorilla.
LEWIS: I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape. Look. You don't have to be afraid. We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
ZIRA: I should. I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
LEWIS: Humans?
ZIRA: I'm a psychiatrist.
LEWIS: So am I. And I mean you no harm.
CORNELIUS: We know that.
LEWIS: Do you have a name?
CORNELIUS: My name is Cornelius. And this is Zira -- my wife.
LEWIS: My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
LEWIS: Nobody's going to believe it.
CORNELIUS: Believe what?
LEWIS: That primitive apes can talk.
ZIRA: Primitive?
LEWIS: I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
ZIRA: May I say something personal?
LEWIS: Please
ZIRA: I like you.
