ANNE: Stewart!
STEW: This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
ANNE: You can't walk out of here like this.
