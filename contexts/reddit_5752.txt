How do you deal with being ashamed for being unemployed?
I’m a new graduate from university. I have been looking for jobs since graduation and I even enlisted the assistance of an employment consultant. 

However I’m also dealing with serious depressive episodes and bouts of anxiety that are crippling me. I can’t even step out of the house. And it’s even worse when I’m living in a toxic environment at home, where everyone is shaming for “sitting at home” when in reality I’m working full-time to apply and look for a job.

How do you deal with the stigma?
