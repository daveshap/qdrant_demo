MRS. SUGERMAN: Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
SEBASTIAN: Yes, you already did.
MRS. SUGERMAN: I did?
SEBASTIAN: Right after we played backgammon.
MRS. SUGERMAN: We played backgammon?
SEBASTIAN: Uh huh. You beat me three times.
MRS. SUGERMAN: I did?
SEBASTIAN: Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
MRS. SUGERMAN: Excuse me?
SEBASTIAN: I said, do you want some water?
MRS. SUGERMAN: Oh... no thank you...
