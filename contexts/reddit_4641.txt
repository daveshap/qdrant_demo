The loneliness is suffocating me and it feels like no one is ever going to decide I’m the person they’ve been looking for, plus horrible upbringing for maximum sad.
My mom died of cancer when I was in high school and for every other example of this scenario playing out in my school district the student in that situation was treated better than normal and given an easy path through the year. Not me, I was treated like garbage and that wore away at a lot of my confidence. Now I miss my mom because it’s been years and even though a couple months ago I was able to buy a house at 24 it feels so empty, I live with my best friend and yet it doesn’t feel the same. It’s not waking up in the middle of the night with your significant other resting on your shoulder. It’s not the late night talks about the future and all the dumb thoughts that come to mind when no one else matters but each other. I miss the fighting, I miss feeling alive with someone else. I’m never an option to anyone, I just get looked past like I’m no one and it stings. I just want to feel needed. If you have  heard Love Falls by Hellyeah, the lyrics speak to me on a level that’s rare. I’m miserable and I hate that I have to keep walking because I’m ready to throw in the towel.
