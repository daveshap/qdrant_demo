Is the Skills Gap a Myth?
A recent SHRM article, written by a professor in the field, argues that [“The Skills Gap is a Myth”](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/1217/pages/the-skills-gap-is-a-myth.aspx).


His arguments confronts the claims that U.S. businesses are having a tough time finding and hiring qualified people because of factors like universities inadequately training recent graduates for the workforce.  He responded that such claims are exaggerated because employers, that used to provide training to new employees (especially in entry-level positions), have been cutting training budgets and are expecting new candidates to come in already trained for the tasks specific to their roles.  This was especially common during the recession when there was a surplus of seasoned employees competing for entry-level jobs.


 As a result, these entry-level positions, that used to serve as starting points in a career for recent graduates, now require multiple years of experience.


The author argues that universities training students for specific job roles is incredibly inefficient because of the rapidly changing demands for different skills in the job market:
>One problem with trying to get our educational institutions to produce the students employers want is that there is no guarantee that anyone will hire them when they graduate. Telling young people to major in, say, petroleum engineering, which was among the hottest jobs this decade, turned out to be bad advice when demand fell off. It’s also incredibly inefficient to try to learn work-based skills in a classroom setting.
