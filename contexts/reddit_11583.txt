I got in trouble for eating cereal at work today
And it really grinds my gears! I work for a healthcare organization that you would think would encourage and promote a healthy lifestyle. For years it’s been a ritual of mine to take a few minutes to quickly chomp down my Cheerios before getting to work. Due to new department changes, we were told that we were no longer allowed to eat ‘a meal’ at our desk, but I got special permission to quickly eat my daily cereal in the break room before getting to work. Well, today my supervisor informed me that I can no longer do this since technically I was on company time and it looks bad that I’m taking a break so early into my shift. Sure, valid point and I completely understood where she was coming from. My complaint is that we’re allowed to eat snacks at our desks (things such as donuts, coffee, candy, chips, ice cream, etc), but it’s not ok to eat a healthy bowl of cereal because apparently that’s classified as a meal!? Makes no sense. I’m pissed because of this and had to vent. Grrrrrr!!
