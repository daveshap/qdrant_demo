Book about people with special powers, recruited to fighting a war against others with powers I remember reading a book about people with special abilities a while back (early-mid 2000's) in which there was a girl and her brother.  There were certain people in the book who had abilities and had to go fight a war against other people with abilities.I think the girl's power was talking to animals (bugs etc...)  and her brother I think had the power of persuasion in that he would always seem to get people to do things for him...  something along those lines?I also remember there was a group of men from the kingdom who tracked down people with special powers, one of them having the ability to find said people as his power...
