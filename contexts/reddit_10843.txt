My best friend and partner in crime just committed suicide, i'm going to join her this evening.
My entire world has gone from shitty but bearable to just 'gone' in the last two months. I had to put my schoolyear on hold because I got diagnosed with depression, got put on antidepressants, my parents consider me a failure but throughout all that, I had one light, one rock to lean on. I would always look forward to doing stuff with her and now she's gone, just like that... She even made me a promise that she would wait but I get that she couldn't wait for me. That's ok, I have 80 clonazolams, some flunitrazolam and some trazodone that i will take this evening with some drinks so if it doesn't kill me it will knock me out nice and long so I wont have to deal with reality for a bit.
