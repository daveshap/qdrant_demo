GALVIN: Dr. Gruber...
GRUBER: Yes? Galvin, right?
GALVIN: I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
GRUBER: That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
GRUBER: I read the hospital report on your client.
GALVIN: ...Deborah Ann Kaye...
GRUBER: ...Deborah Ann Kaye...
GALVIN: They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
GRUBER: Right. Who called?
GALVIN: The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
GRUBER: ...and you're going to do that?
GALVIN: Yes.
GRUBER: You're going to settle out of court?
GALVIN: Yes.
GRUBER: Why?
GALVIN: Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors...
GRUBER: Her doctors killed her.
GALVIN: I'm sorry...?
GRUBER: Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. Her doctors murdered her.
GALVIN: Do you know who her doctors were?
GRUBER: I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
GALVIN: The most respected...
GRUBER: Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
