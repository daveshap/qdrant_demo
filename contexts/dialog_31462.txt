VICKI: What?
MARY-KAY: The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
VICKI: Why's that?
MARY-KAY: You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
VICKI: Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
MARY-KAY: Just trying to be helpful.
VICKI: Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
