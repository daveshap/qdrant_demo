I'm a non-thesis masters student, will that hurt me when looking for jobs?
I'm currently in my school's non-thesis masters program in environmental biology. My advisor from undergrad recommended I do the non-thesis option because I wasn't entirely dead set on knowing exactly what career path I want to pursue. I'm considering doing work within the field of fisheries, but now I'm worried that I might not even get considered for a job unless I have thesis work I've done. I'm still looking at other career paths I want to go towards. I'm interested in doing field work and specifically something environmental but like I mentioned before I'm worried that I won't get a good job without thesis work. Sorry if I'm rambling here, does anybody have any experience or recommendations on this? Anything would be appreciated. Thanks!
