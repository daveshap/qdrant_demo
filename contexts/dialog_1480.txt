BATEMAN: Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
JEAN: I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
BATEMAN: If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you?
JEAN: No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
JEAN: And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
BATEMAN: Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.
