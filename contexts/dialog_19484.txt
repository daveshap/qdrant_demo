PREACHER: Did you hear what I said, son?
JOHN HARPER: Huh?
PREACHER: Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
JOHN HARPER: You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
PREACHER: -- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
JOHN HARPER: You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
PREACHER: Tell me what, boy?
JOHN HARPER: Nothin'!
PREACHER: Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
JOHN HARPER: No. No.
