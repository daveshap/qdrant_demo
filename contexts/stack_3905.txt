How do I find out if there is a relationship between confidence (continuous variable) and accuracy(categorical) I am looking finding out if confidence (rated between 0 and 10) has an effect on accuracy (correct or incorrect) and am unsure what test to run.My study is looking at how line up condition (PACE sequential, Strict sequential and Pace sequential plus matrix) and target presence (target present or absent) affected accuracy (correct or incorrect). There were 6 groups PACE sequential target present, PACE sequential target absent, Strict sequential target present etc). I have carried out a log-linear analysis to find this out. The participants were also asked about confidence of identification. I now want to find out if confidence (self-rated on a scale between 1 and 10) is related to accuracy and am unsure on how to do this (to see if there is a relationship with both of them). If I split confidence into two groups - high confidence (scores between 5-10) and low confidence (scores between 0-5) could I then do a correlation? Or would another test be more suited?Would I have to find the relationship with each of the participants groups (all 6) or could I just do it just between confidence and accuracy in general?
