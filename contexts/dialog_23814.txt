JACK: Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
MILES: Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
JACK: Oh Jesus, Miles.
JACK: And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
MILES: Shut up. Shut your face.
JACK: Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here. Drink some agua.
MILES: Should we get dessert?
STEPHANIE: We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
