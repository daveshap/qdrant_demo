CREASY: No.
PINTA: You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
CREASY: No.
PINTA: Why not?
CREASY: I'm looking for potential.
PINTA: Potential? I don't understand.
CREASY: Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
PINTA: Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
CREASY: Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
PINTA: Someone gave him more money than we could.
CREASY: I'm a bargain.
PINTA: Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
CREASY: Time will tell.
PINTA: There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
CREASY: Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
