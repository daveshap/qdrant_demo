AUDREY: Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
NICK: Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
AUDREY: You never said it was off the record.
NICK: I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
AUDREY: I didn't mean for it to turn out like this. Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
NICK: So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
