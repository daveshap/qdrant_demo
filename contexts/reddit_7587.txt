What should I expect as a TA?
So I got into my graduate school on an assistantship, and they assigned me to be a TA. I don’t really know what it entails since the description is vague. I just don’t feel qualified to be honest... I’m an incredibly shy person so I’m terrified that because of that I won’t be able to do the job.

I know I’ll be grading assignments and papers, but beyond that what will I really be doing? Will I be instructing? Because I don’t think I know anything good enough to instruct or lecture about it. Will I be trained at all on how to do the job or will they just go over what’s legally required and leave me to hang?
