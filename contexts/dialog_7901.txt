ED: Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
BELA: Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget. Just keep looking forward.
ED: But was it a bad decision? At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
BELA: Eddie, you screwed up.
ED: Yeah, I did.
BELA: In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered. Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me. The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
ED: Really?
BELA: It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
ED: So why didn't you do it?
BELA: I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag. I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
ED: But maybe not.
BELA: Correct. So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback. Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
