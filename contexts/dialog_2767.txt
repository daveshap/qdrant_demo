MAYHEW: If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
AUDREY: That's hamburger grease, Bill.
MAYHEW: Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me – lyin' and deceitful...
MAYHEW: ...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
BARTON: Well... actually, no Bill...
BARTON: ...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering. Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
MAYHEW: Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
MAYHEW: ...This'll sometimes help.
AUDREY: That doesn't help anything, Bill.
