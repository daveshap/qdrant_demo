TEDDY: She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
LEONARD: From who?
TEDDY: Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
LEONARD: Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
TEDDY: She couldn't.
LEONARD: Why not? MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
TEDDY: She has no idea who I am.
LEONARD: Why are you following me?
TEDDY: I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
LEONARD: Happy now?
TEDDY: I won't be happy until you leave town.
LEONARD: Why?
TEDDY: How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
LEONARD: What sort of questions?
TEDDY: The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
LEONARD: Like what?
TEDDY: Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
LEONARD: I have money.
: 69.
TEDDY: From what?
LEONARD: My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
TEDDY: So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
LEONARD: Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
TEDDY: That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
LEONARD: I didn't sell -
TEDDY: I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
LEONARD: Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
TEDDY: Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town.
