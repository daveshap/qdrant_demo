Rejected for a job due to personality test results?
I was elated to have an interview with a company for, what seemed to be, the perfect position. A recruiter actually found me on LinkedIn and said I would be perfect for the job and they would be silly not to hire me. I send in my resume and score an interview! The company asked before we interviewed if I would take a personality assessment. I know some large companies do this to get a sense of the person before they commit to hiring. I do the assessment, still good for the interview. I had probably one of the smoothest interviews ever! I was so confident this was going to work out. The interviewer was thrilled with my experience and excited for me to join the team. I even sent a follow-up thank you email.

A couple days go by and I finally hear from my recruiter: It was a no! I was stunned! My recruiter said the person who interviewed me loved me, she fought for me to be accepted. But, apparently, the owner of the company is basing hires on these personality tests, and I just didn't fit the mold!?

I have had some time to think and reflect: it's like it wasn't me, but, it was me? Idk, I am still confused.. If. Company was basing hiring on those tests- why conduct interviews of those who don't "make the cut"?

Has anyone had this happen? Are you familiar with these tests?

The ones they used were from PI- my result was a collaborator. The job I was interviewing for was project management. Literally, the same job I was doing at my last job- just a different company.

The recruiter also stated they wouldn't tell her what parameters they are really looking for...
