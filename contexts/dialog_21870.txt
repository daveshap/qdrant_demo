LISA: You can't buy that kind of publicity.
JEFF: That's good news.
LISA: Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
JEFF: How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
LISA: Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
JEFF: I wish there was one I wanted.
LISA: Make the one you want.
JEFF: You mean leave the magazine?
LISA: Yes.
JEFF: For what?
LISA: For yourself -- and me. I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
LISA: Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
JEFF: That's what I'm afraid of. Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard?
LISA: I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
JEFF: Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
