FLETCHER: Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
ANDERTON: You're kidding, that's today?
FLETCHER: I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
ANDERTON: All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now. Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded. See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
FLETCHER: Uh, sir...
ANDERTON: Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
