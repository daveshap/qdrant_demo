HONORIUS: There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
PRESIDENT: Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
HONORIUS: Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
ZIRA: That√ïs a lie!
PRESIDENT: Mind your tongue, madame.
ZIRA: Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
HONORIUS: He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
PRESIDENT: Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
HONORIUS: Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
TAYLOR: I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
HONORIUS: Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think. Tell us why all apes are created equal.
TAYLOR: Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
HONORIUS: Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
TAYLOR: Show this to the President.
ZIRA: Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
