I just want to be kinky and f**k but only w/ someone I really like and can be in a serious relationship with.
rant- UGH just fuck me but also cuddle me for hours. kiss me softly but also make out with me all the time. et cetera. i recently decided to stop “trying” to get find a good guy (because i’m always disappointed), but i’m still open to them conveniently falling into my lap. WHY is this not happening to me?? is it really that hard to fall in L❤️VE?!?!
