JUDGE: Huh?
TYRONE: He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
HUEY: Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
JUDGE: I'm down.
HUEY: Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
JUDGE: I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But...
HUEY: You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
JUDGE: Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
HUEY: Mind if I ask you something? Why'd you put up with shit like that for someone else's war?
JUDGE: Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
HUEY: Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
JUDGE: Whatever you need, I'll be there.
HUEY: Right on Brother Judge...
