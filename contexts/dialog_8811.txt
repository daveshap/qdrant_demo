KAY: Merlin, will I live...? ...I was dreaming...
ARTHUR: Of Merlin?
KAY: Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
ARTHUR: I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
