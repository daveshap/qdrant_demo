Scholarships for SA grad students?
Hi friends! I'm starting my SA grad program in August. While my assistantship pays for a good deal of the program, there's a few thousand dollars worth of odds and ends not covered. I've been scouring the net for some scholarships to cover these extra fees, but everything that I've found is university-specific. 

During my time as an undergrad, I was heavily involved in student activities, a class officer for three years, and a Resident Assistant. I am sure there are at least a couple of scholarships out there that I can draw from these experiences with, but I can't find them. :( Any suggestions?
