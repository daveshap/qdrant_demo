What is the safest decision?
I left my last position under good circumstances, yet came very close having horrible consequences.  

I am in my mid 30s and am terrified of making a poor mistake with my next job.

All three options are in the realm of my training (logistics), however each come with risks.

One is with a very large firm that offered me a job based on experiences I had 3-5 years ago.  That knowledge hasn’t been tapped into for years.  I am very rusty on it, however I have the certifications that say otherwise.  This would require a move.  This pays the best for salary (six figures).  Contract based.

One is local, however it is with a medium sized firm that pays the best (Cost of living).  Great job security, however been in same spot for 7 years and ready to see new things and leave some things behind.

One might be considered a step down but is incredibly easy work.  Near best in COL.  would require a move.  Would be big fish in little pond.  Would be closeish to home but that doesn’t matter during covid.

I’m a mess right now with these options.

Advice?
