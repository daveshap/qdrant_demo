like a girl but hate the way she makes me feel.
First let me say I'm 23/m and for most of my life I've been really unemotional, I remember all the emotions from back before I was about 10 or so, but since then for most of my time I've felt completely empty, I know how to act whenever I need to show emotions but I never really feel them except for the very rare day every few months where I wake up and I'm able to feel emotions all day, then when I go back to sleep I don't feel them the next 2-6 months.  I'm fine with this and accepted this is just how I am and will probably always be.

But I just started college again a few weeks ago and I met this really awesome girl in my class, beautiful, smart, awesome personality, the whole deal really, I can't help but smile when I'm around her, and my heart races just thinking about her, but all this is bringing out feelings I haven't had in years and I'm really hating it. I know she is out of my league and probably deserves better, but I really want to ask her out but I don't want to feel these feelings anymore, i can't handle them. 

Basically I really don't know what to do, or even how I would ask her out.
