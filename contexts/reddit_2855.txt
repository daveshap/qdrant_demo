How do I find a career when I'm interested in most things?
I'm 16 right now, and it feels like most of my classmates have at one or two interests they are passionate about and are thinking of doing as a career. I was told as a freshman to branch out and explore different extracurriculars as much as possible and I've done that, but now I feel like I'm interested in too many things. I'm not fantastic at any of the things I'm in, and I'm not more passionate about one over the others. Almost every job option that I'm presented with I feel like I could do as a career. I don't hate anything, and I don't love anything. How do I narrow down what I want to do?

(I don't know if this is helpful, but right now I'm school treasurer, do sound design for theater, am head of writing club, and am in coding club. My math GPA is trash because of some medical problems freshman and sophomore year, so STEM seems kinda unachievable right now.)
