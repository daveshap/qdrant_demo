EARL: I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
BOOTH: It was all used. Random numbers. How can they trace it?
EARL: I don't know. They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
BOOTH: Then we're screwed.
EARL: No we're not.
BOOTH: We're not? How do you figure that?
EARL: We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
BOOTH: We've got to go now, then.
EARL: That's right.
BOOTH: Then Sally comes too.
