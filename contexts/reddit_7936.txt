Trouble understanding research papers
I am a new masters student in my second semester of grad school in electrical and computer engineering. I am having trouble understanding a lot of the research papers I am reading due to:
1. Not knowing the mathematical notation of a lot of the papers I am reading
2. Having trouble understanding the actual math due to not having a course in this level abstract or statistical mathematics

A lot of my papers talk about minimizing the L2 norm for exampe and I am trying to find a resource or multiple resources to help me understanding the notation and what is actually being done when the paper is trying to minimize the L2 norm (just an example).

If anyone has any good links or books I should pick up I would greatly apprecaite that.
