You can do WAY more than you think, don't let your insecurities define you. Listen to the wisdom inside you and cherish it. You have something good to bring into this world, let it be heard. Have a nice day ;)
Edit: thank you for all the positive feedback, it puts a smile on my face to know that you can believe in this post and that you're all filled with hope ;)

It's ofcourse often not easy to believe in yourself, a "quick fix" doesn't exist and maybe this post is very vague for you. I elaborated on this topic in the comments. Hope it can help you!
