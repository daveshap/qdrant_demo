JOHNS: We aren't completely stupid.
FRY: Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
IMAM: We crossed our own tracks.
JOHNS: He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
FRY: Riddick? What the hell are you --
RIDDICK: <u>Listen</u>.
RIDDICK: Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
FRY: Think about what?
JOHNS: About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
RIDDICK: About the girl.
FRY: What about her?
RIDDICK: What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
JOHNS: What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
RIDDICK: No. She's not.
AUDREY: I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
FRY: No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
JOHNS: Aw, this can't be happening to me....
RIDDICK: They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
IMAM: Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
RIDDICK: There is no safe.""
