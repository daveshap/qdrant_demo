PAUL: No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
BIK: That's what I came to talk to you about.
PAUL: Excuse me?
BIK: The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
PAUL: Leave it to me.
BIK: Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
PAUL: Of course.
