What are my options when I graduate?
Hi everyone! I am in a masters program right now in electrical engineering studying neural engineering. I am trying to decide whether I should stick with this or BME when I graduate, switch to something with clinical options like clinical psych or an MD/PhD, or switch to a completely different field. Like many of you, I would love a job as faculty, even in a community college just to teach, but the chances of that are slim. I’ve had multiple internships in electrical engineering positions in industry and hated all of them. While it’s possible it was because the work was boring for someone with just a bachelor’s degree, I’m pretty sure I don’t want to work in industry. That being said, if I get my PhD in neural engineering, are my options really academia (unlikely) or industry? Are there any other options for someone with a PhD in this field? Are there any other related fields I could switch to that would give me more options, especially either in teaching or some type of human interaction (hence the clinical work idea)? 

Sorry if this doesn’t belong here, but there isn’t really a neural engineering sub so I wasn’t sure where to ask this.
