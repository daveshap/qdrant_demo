WOMAN: What do you think?
ROB: It's the best collection I've ever seen.
WOMAN: Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
ROB: These are worth at least, I don't know --
WOMAN: I know what they're worth. Give me fifty and get them out.
ROB: But you must have --
WOMAN: I must have nothing. Their my husband's.
ROB: And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
WOMAN: He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old. A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me. Can you make sure you give me a five? I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
ROB: It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
WOMAN: Years. This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
ROB: Look. Can I pay you properly? You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest. Give it to charity. Or something.
WOMAN: That wasn't part of the deal. I want to be poisonous but fair.
ROB: Look... I... I'm sorry. I don't want to be any part of this.
WOMAN: Suit yourself. There are plenty of others who will.
ROB: That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred? They're worth five times that.
WOMAN: Sixty.
ROB: Thirteen hundred.
WOMAN: Seventy-five.
ROB: Eleven-hundred. That's my lowest offer.
WOMAN: And I won't take a penny over ninety.
WOMAN: With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
ROB: I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
WOMAN: Fine.
ROB: Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
WOMAN: Sure. Ten cents.
ROB: Oh, come on! Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
WOMAN: Okay. Because you took the trouble to come up here. And because you've got principles. But that's it. I'm not selling them to you one by one.
