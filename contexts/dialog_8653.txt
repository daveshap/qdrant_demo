CLEMENTINE: How can you watch this crap?
JOEL: Where are you going?
CLEMENTINE: I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
JOEL: Oh shit. I remember this. Want to go?
CLEMENTINE: I want to have a baby.
JOEL: Let's talk about it later.
CLEMENTINE: No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
JOEL: I don't think we're ready.
CLEMENTINE: You're not ready.
JOEL: Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
CLEMENTINE: What?!
JOEL: I don't want to talk about this here.
CLEMENTINE: Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
CLEMENTINE: You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
JOEL: Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
CLEMENTINE: I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
JOEL: Oh, thank God. It's going.
CLEMENTINE: It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
