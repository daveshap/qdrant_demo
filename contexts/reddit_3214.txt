I'm a 48-year-old mom of 3 looking at a second career. I made the wrong decisions once, how do I make sure I don't mess up again?
I'm 48, have 3 kids (2 grown and 1 teen), and am a foster mom for abused infants. I've been a nurse for the past 27 years and I'm done. I'm finally at a point in life where I don't have to work at a job I hate and I can do something I love. I'm having a hard time deciding on what to do though. I am torn between two life-long loves and afraid to make the wrong decision. 

 I've wanted to be a grade school art teacher since I was a kid, but I'm not talented when it comes to fine arts (drawing, painting, etc..). I would, of course, go back to school for art and teaching; getting my degree in art education. Do you think it's possible to learn artistic skills and be an art teacher without natural artistic ability? Do you think 50 or 51 is too old to start a teaching career?

My other love is babies and supporting and educating at risk families. I was a teen mom, with no mom of my own. I know how hard and scary that is. I don't know what job THAT job is though. I want to take care of babies and help at-risk families. I want to do hands-on care, but not like daycare. I would go back to school for this as well and major in child development- but I have no idea what this job is. 

How do you decide what you want to be when you grow up? I'm so afraid of making the wrong choice. I made a hasty decision when I was young and did what was quick and would make enough money to pay bills. I was stuck in that career for 27 years. Now I get a "do-over" and I'm fearful of making the wrong decision again.
