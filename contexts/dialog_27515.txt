GUY: Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
DANNY: What were you, following me?
GUY: How do you reconcile the two?
DANNY: I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
GUY: Explain it so I can.
DANNY: You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
GUY: I don't think you know what you are.
DANNY: Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
GUY: Who killed Manzetti?
DANNY: If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
GUY: It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would. Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
DANNY: Get the fuck away from me.
