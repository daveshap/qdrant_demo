How do you network when you’re reserved, shy, and closed-off?
Basically, how do you network when you’re not fake? 

Background: I’ve had (and continue to have) SO MUCH networking opportunities that could really benefit me, but I’m way too closed-off and fucked up to entertain anyone who talks to me, let alone go up to people and start a conversation. 

Of course, I’m sure not everyone wants to connect with a happy-go-lucky person and some people appreciate the more serious, calm, and genuine personality.... but I’m really struggling to even have normal conversations with people who could truly help me, I know it has to do with me being fucked up internally/emotionally, but I would really appreciate some advice to help at the moment as I can very *very* rarely carry on a conversation without it becoming awkward (even when I want to!!!!!!)

I would really appreciate any advice :(

Edit: Just to clarify, I wasn’t referring to outgoing/talkative people when I said  “fake people”. I’m talking about people who put on a fake smile and use a high-pitched voice and act extremely polite to people they know they can get something from. I’ve seen these kinds of people and the second their target turns around they roll their eyes or just talk shit about them behind their back, or later on they’ll admit they actually hated them. I know that “you gotta do what you gotta do” to get places in life, but I’m just struggling to do that because I hate the fake pretentious atmosphere since I’m a very undiplomatic blunt person and if I don’t love someone I won’t entertain them. I hate “not living my truth” as cringey as that may sound. Idk how else to put it but I just want advice on how to do well in this game without stopping down that low.
