Jobs that keep the job description vague
It seems like a lot of job postings now a days indicate that they can ask you to do pretty much anything and you would have to do it. " Performing other tasks as needed" "Ad Hoc" etc. why is it like this? This only leaves room for the employer to over work the employee without any pay raise etc. 

Also a lot of jobs are just keeping the job description as vague as possible so they can throw anything at you at anytime with no room to say no to the task
