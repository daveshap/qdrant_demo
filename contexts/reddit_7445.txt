Anyone here working on Environmental Sustainability and Urbanization?
Hi, anywhere here working on environmental sustainability in the context of the Global South as part of their PhD research? I am contemplating applying to PhD programmes this fall and looking for programmes that focus on themes of urban metabolism, urbanization and sustainability,  resource loops and circular economy. Would love to hear about your experience at your school.

Thanks!

Edit: For reference, IHE-Delft and UCB's Department of Environmental, Science, Policy and Management are in my list of dream schools as of now (agnostic to region).
