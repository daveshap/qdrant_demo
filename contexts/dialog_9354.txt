STACY: Take that back.
DAMONE: All right, I take it back.
DAMONE: There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
STACY: We've got to get an abortion?
DAMONE: Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
STACY: It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
DAMONE: Doesn't sound free to me. So you want me to pay for it?
STACY: Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
DAMONE: Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
