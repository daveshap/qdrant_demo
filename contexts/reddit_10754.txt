Thinking of killing myself comforts me because if everything gets too much to handle, I always have a choice to way out.
I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but lately I've been thinking about suicide a lot and it really makes me feel better that I can always make the choice when I want to. And that I don't need to deal with any consequences that come after, although it might sound selfish.
