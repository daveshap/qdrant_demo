Socket Tester all indicators light up I used the above GFCI/RCD (up to 250v) socket tester on the 240v black and red live wire of the US split phase ac power system. When I connect the ground, all indicator lights (3 red) got on indicating \"Live/Grd Reverse, Missing GRD\" although it is connected properly.What is inside the socket tester? Does it have a live and neutral leg such that it should only be used for ac system with polarity? How about if you use it on the red and black 240v phase to phase? Why would all the indicators light become on (3 red lights)?The following is the specs of it:Specifications: Brand Name: HABOTEST Color: Black Material: Flame Retardant ABSPlug Type: US Voltage: 48V-250V 45-65Hz RCD Test: >30mA (EU/UK Plug) RCD Working Voltage: 220V\u00b120V GFCI Test: >5mA (US Plug) GFCI Working Voltage: 110V\u00b120V Voltage Measurement: 48V~250V / 45~65Hz Accuracy: \u00b1(2.0%+2) Working Environment: 0\u00b0C ~ 40\u00b0C, 20% ~75%RH Storage Environment: -10\u00b0C ~ 50\u00b0C, 20% ~80%RH Safety Rating: EN61010-1,-2-030, EN61326-1,CAT II 300V Item Size: 62 * 65 * 55mm / 2.4 * 2.6 * 2.2in Item Weight: UK 64g/2.3oz, EU 59g/2.1oz, US 53g / 1.9oz Package Size: 7.5 * 7.4 * 7.3cm / 3.0 * 2.9 * 2.9in Package Weight: UK 90g/3.2oz, EU 86g/3.0oz, US 79g / 2.8oz
