Thank you all
I few weeks ago I posted needing support and this is my update. I went through some horrible things and had to do things to keep myself going. I was clouded by fear and emptyness I just kept tripping and falling g deeper. I then proceeded to try to commit Suicide by OD and failed. Doctor said if I had 5 more mg it would've done it. But he said "You may be dead right now mentally but your body physically fought to live. Showing that you can still find peace" Which changed me. IT MADE ME FEEL EMOTION. IT MADE ME SMILE. IT MADE ME REBIRTH INTO WHAT I AM NOW. I still have dark times but I know I can always get up and Fuck the World. And so no I'm here tpying to in hope that one person will see this and give them hope or feelings to live and go another day. To give them the motivation j was starved of for years and what costed me friendships. It will be hard guys . You will have to make hard decisions and may have to cut relations . YOU MAY EVEN HAVE TO REBIRTH YOURSELF SPIRTUALLY. BUT YOU MUST ALWAYS KEEP FIGHTING I BELIEVE IN YOU ALL! ❤️ Also S/O to u/ellisstone for getting me though this
