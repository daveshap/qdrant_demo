Today is the day, thank you all
So I finally did it... I paid back my student loans today, I'M DEBT FREE!!!  

Thank you all for helping me through the low times, you may not know it but still.   Everyone else still working through the grind hang in there, feeling the weight off my shoulders is so much greater than i even imagined it.  Now I'm off to save for a down payment.
