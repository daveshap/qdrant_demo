SAM: Okay This is okay. Smooth. Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
JOSIE: That's what makes you interesting. As a teacher.
SAM: God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
JOSIE: You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
SAM: You have to say that. You're my student.
JOSIE: I don't have to say that.
