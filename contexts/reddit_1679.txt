The only time I get acceptance emails is when I'm pooping.
All my three acceptances so far, have been when I'm scrolling on my phone on the toilet. In the bus? Deferred. At my desk? Rejection. Toilet? Magic. 

I get accepted and proceed to run out the door, pull up my pants, and hug my parents ! :) My correlation analysis concludes I need to live  on the toilet now. I'm being totally real - not a shitpost. Well, it's kind of a shit-related post. Anyways! I advise myself to go eat some fibre!

Edit: thanks for the karma!! I had no idea my poop is award-worthy but I really a-pee-ciate it (Iâ€™m sorry)
