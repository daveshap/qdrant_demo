Selling plasma probably won't pay your bills, but it keeps food on the table and gas in your tank.
I've been selling plasma on and off for over a year. It's not glamorous and I'm not too happy about the mark on my arm, but it has kept my family fed and able to continue going to work/school. 

Many plasma centers have onsite daycare during at least part of their open hours (I know BioLife does at most locations), and donations typically range from 45 minutes to an hour (second donation onward - the first donation is long because of physicals, questionnaires, getting your profile set up, etc). 

Plasma donation definitely isn't for everyone, and it certainly hasn't boosted me out of poverty, but it helps me feel more secure knowing that even when my bank account is low, I can net $70 a week for groceries and gas. It's also nice to spend an hour just reading browsing the internet, or playing a game. 


Some tips:

-Drink a lot of water the night before. The donation will go faster, and you'll feel much better.

-Don't eat a huge, fatty meal beforehand. It can stop your donation if your plasma looks too milk-like (excessive fat), and you won't be compensated.

-That being said, do eat a meal with protein an hour or two prior to donation. Your blood protein, iron content, and blood pressure are taken prior to every donation. If your iron or protein is too low or high, you'll be deferred for a day.

-Take advantage of promotions and coupons. Plasma centers often run frequency bonuses each month, and first time donors usually have coupon codes available that will exponentially increase your first month's payout.

-Evenings, weekends, and lunch time will always be peak plasma center traffic hours. There's not much way around this if you work a typical day shift, unfortunately. 

-Recommend plasma donation to people; most places have referral bonuses. Offer to split the bonus if it helps get someone in the door, if you want.
