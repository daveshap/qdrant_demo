A call to end ghosting
It SUCKS to know you might hurt someone’s feelings. It really does. But it’s even worse to leave them in the dark. In this post, I propose we all (myself included) work to end mismatches and small flings with maturity and grace. 

Ghosting leaves individuals without a sense of closure. Closure, as we might know from personal experience, is incredibly important to many of us! When we are ghosted, we leave even the most casual encounters with a sense of unease and, perhaps, the tiniest bit of what feels like grief. 

I have been working on ending mismatches or flings I have met in person with simple sentences. My most general is, “I don’t feel this is a match.” Generally, it goes over well. Yes, I do have a fear someone will cling and make promises they cannot possibly keep. This is where my boundary setting skills get tested and I repeat that this isn’t a good match and wouldn’t work. 

I try not to bring up any personal things- sometimes it has nothing to do with who the person is, but rather who I am as a person. We’re all trying to find matches, and just because one doesn’t work out doesn’t meant there’s anything wrong with either. It’s simply not a good match. ANYWAYS I got off topic. 

END GHOSTING. Let’s be mature adults! 

Thank you.

EDIT: I’ve gotten enough responses assuming that I’m pissed off that I’m getting ghosted that I feel I should clarify on the post instead of individual comments: first, I am a woman...not a man. Second, I have been reflecting on my own ghosting and realized it’s kind of shitty of me to do. I’m not trying to change anyone, make them do what I think they should do. I’m just putting it out there that perhaps there are better ways to communicate than just ignoring people.

Thank you.
