ENID: God, what a bunch of retards...
REBECCA: I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
ENID: I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
REBECCA: It's totally sickening. Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
ENID: What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
REBECCA: What?
ENID: These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
REBECCA: Why?
ENID: Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an F" that means you have to take the class over again."
REBECCA: You loser.
REBECCA: This is so bad, it's almost good.
ENID: This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
ENID: Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
REBECCA: Unless they're in your Summer school class!
ENID: Shut up!
REBECCA: Uh oh... don't turn around...
ENID: What? Why?
REBECCA: Forget it...
MELORRA: Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
ENID: Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
MELORRA: So what are you guys doing this Summer?
ENID: Nothing.
MELORRA: I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
ENID: Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
MELORRA: Well, bye you guys... CONGRATULATIONS!
ENID: Since when is she an actress"?"
REBECCA: I know, she needs to die immediately.
