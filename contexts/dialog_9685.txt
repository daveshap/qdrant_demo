JACK: Parry?
DOCTOR: He can't hear you. Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub.... I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand... ...catatonic stupor"...condition rendered him non-verbal for a period of -..."
JACK: Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right? He'll snap out of it?
DOCTOR: I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
JACK: But..How could that happen?
DOCTOR: Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives? Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution..
JACK: What if I was a relative?
DOCTOR: You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
