VIOLET: It's in a case, on his desk.
CORKY: Does the case lock?
VIOLET: Yes.
CORKY: Good.
CORKY: All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
VIOLET: Johnnie?
CORKY: It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
VIOLET: Like each other? They hate each other.
CORKY: Why?
VIOLET: It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
CORKY: Who is Gino?
VIOLET: Gino Marzzone.
CORKY: Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
VIOLET: That's his brother.
CORKY: ... shit.
CORKY: Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
VIOLET: Yeah.
CORKY: And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
VIOLET: Yeah.
CORKY: Sweet Jesus.
