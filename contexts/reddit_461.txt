how do i get him off my mind(f16)
i was inseparable friends with a guy in my grade and we kinda merged friends and made a big group of us that were very close. a couple months ago everyone started kinda getting heated at eachother with possible relationships or just petty fights so the group split after a bit but me and him still hung out everyday for another two months. we kinda drifted when school started and since then i’ve been very depressed and put on medication. i don’t know if it’s him, school, or bad genetics but i can’t fucking live like this. everyday i think of how happy i used to be and it actually physically hurts my chest. it feels like i won’t be that happy again and i’m too scared to tell anyone that i think the reason is that my friend dropped me. that sounds pathetic and a lot of people thought we were dating which we weren’t. that could complicate things for both of us so i don’t want my friends to think i got depressed because he broke up with me. i also don’t want to tell my doctors because my mom is always in there with me and she also thought we were dating. but it all seems like i’d be judged so hard for being weak. weak enough to completely spiral because my friend left. does anyone know how to get someone off your mind and just basically forget about them or any coping mechanisms? or maybe i should just tell my therapist that’s the reason i think this happened but i really don’t want to because it is so fuckin pathetic.
