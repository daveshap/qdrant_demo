MAN: Can I help you?
JACK: Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
MAN: Kate? No, there’s no one here named Kate. Is that good enough for you?
JACK: Damn...damn...damn...
MAN: Hey, are you okay?
JACK: No...I’m not...
MAN: Is there anything I can do for you?
MAN: Hey, my wife’s in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
JACK: I’m sorry, no...
ARNIE: Hey, you can’t park that thing here.
JACK: It’s me, Jack...
ARNIE: I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
JACK: Tell me you recognize me, Arnie. Please...
ARNIE: How’d you know my name?
JACK: We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
ARNIE: I never won anything in bowling.
ARNIE: Wait a second... Jack...Jack...
JACK: Yes...Jack Campbell...
ARNIE: Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right? You’re doing well...
JACK: Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
ARNIE: You never really talked to me. I wanted to talk to you, man...
JACK: Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could’ve been really good friends...
JACK: Hello?
ADELLE: Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
JACK: Adelle?
ADELLE: You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? They’re all panicked here...
