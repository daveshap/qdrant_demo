Was hired for an NYC office position with new company, but with COVID-19 and my wife's new position, how can I have a conversation about being transferred to the Los Angeles office?
I work in the corporate real estate field for an international service provider. I have lived and worked in LA for the last few years with one company, and just recently (in the last month) was hired to join another company in their NYC office. My wife and I thought it could be a cool adventure to try living in a new city, but obviously that was before COVID-19. We actually haven't moved yet, because the stay-at-home orders are in effect and the new company totally understands that.

Now, we're both apprehensive about moving to epicenter of the virus in the US, but mostly because my wife was recently hired at a huge company and this will be her first major job in her field since graduating college. I don't want her to sacrifice this opportunity for my move.

This new company I work for has regional offices, one of which is the LA office. I was never interviewed by anyone from LA nor offered a position here. However, we are all part of the "strategic consulting" group nationwide and lots of people work on different projects across the U.S.

My question is: how do I start a conversation (and with who) about this change in my wife and I's plans, and how I still want to be with the company, but work from Los Angeles?
