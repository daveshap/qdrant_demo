PLATO: I came here before.
JIM: When was that?
PLATO: When I was here? When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
JIM: Who?
PLATO: Mom and Dad. I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
JIM: You remember that far back? Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
JUDY: Plato, where's your father now?
PLATO: He's dead. He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
PLATO: I did? Well, he might as well be dead. What's the difference?
JUDY: It's all right.
