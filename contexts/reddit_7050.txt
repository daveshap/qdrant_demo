Hot tip for landing a job at a tech startup
Create an online course on Udemy for the software of the company you are interested in working for. There are tons of resources out there to help you create an online course and you could use one of the many free screen capture tools out there to create the videos. After the course is published, apply to the company and mention the course. Even if the course isnâ€™t spectacular, it still demonstrates your interest in the company and should propel you above the other candidates.

This idea worked for me - I just accepted a job offer to the company I had made an online course for. It goes without saying that you still need to have some relevant experience and kill the interviews. An online course might just help you get your foot in the door.
