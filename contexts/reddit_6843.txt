I just recently got laid off due to COVID cut backs and I'm nervous that I will have to uproot my family and move to another state/country. Any words of comfort or advice from anyone who has had to move for a job?
The reason I might have to move is that I haven't been able to find very many jobs that I qualify for in my area.  I am a mechanical design engineer and all the jobs within driving distance that are hiring right now are medical device companies that require experience in medical device design, which I don't have.  I have been applying anyways, but I keep getting automated response saying that I don't have the right qualifications for the job.

I grew up in southern California and my and my wife's whole family live here so it would be hard to leave them all. Also, our kids are young and just started making their own friends and I know it will be really hard for them to leave their friends and have to try and make new ones since it took them quite some time to build the friendships they have here.

I'm also nervous for myself since I have never lived anywhere else. I know where to go and where not to go, where to eat and where not to eat. It has taken a lifetime to learn all that I know about where I live and I still keep learning and it stress me out a little thinking about having to start over.
