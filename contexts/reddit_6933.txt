My coordinator was let go and management has pretty much insinuated that I am not to reach out to her. I want to help and let her know I'd be a reference.
Should I disregard what management said and reach out to her but just request that she keep it between us? Or should I play it safe and just keep my distance?

She and I had a great working relationship, but budget cuts came to play when it came to her role so I was told she would need to be let go. Wasn't my decision at all, but I had to roll with the punches.

Just need a little guidance on how I should handle this.
