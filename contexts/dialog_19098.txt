NAPOLEON: Well, Belliard, what's this? What are you doing here? Where is the enemy?
BELLIARD: They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
NAPOLEON: And where is the army?
BELLIARD: It is on this road, sire, following me.
NAPOLEON: And who is defending Paris?
BELLIARD: Paris is evacuated, sire. The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning. The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
NAPOLEON: Paris has surrendered?! I don't believe it.
BELLIARD: Unhappily, it is true, sire.
NAPOLEON: But where are my wife and son? What's become of them? Where is Marmont? Where is Mortier?
BELLIARD: The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet. Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
