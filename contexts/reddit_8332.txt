What proposals exist for the replacement of Obamacare?
President-elect Trump and his allies in Congress have promised to repeal and replace the PPACA (aka "Obamacare"). Are there solid proposals on the table yet for [what that replacement would look like?](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442019/republican-congress-president-trumps-obamacare-path-forward-what-now)

Trump's campaign site [promotes a replacement that follows "free market principles,"](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform) although Trump himself has said repeatedly that he [favors universal health care.](https://www.statnews.com/2016/02/05/trump-cruz-universal-health-care/) What kind of policy would square those two concepts?
