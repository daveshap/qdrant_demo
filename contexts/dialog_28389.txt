LONNEGAN: Your boss is quite a card player, Carver. How does he do it?
HOOKER: He cheats.
LONNEGAN: He'll have to take a check. I couldn't find my wallet.
HOOKER: Yeh, he knows that.
LONNEGAN: What do you mean?
HOOKER: He hired a dame to take it from ya.
HOOKER: You were set up, Lonnegan. Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months. He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
LONNEGAN: I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
HOOKER: So could Shaw.
LONNEGAN: Then why the rat?
HOOKER: Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger. I want you to help me break him.
