SAM: Perfect. We'll be there.
SAM: Hi.
VICTORIA: Hi.

VICTORIA: I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
SAM: You could have called me --
VICTORIA: No way. No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after... There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
SAM: You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
