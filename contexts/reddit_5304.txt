What is the best way to deal with a co-worker who leaves early and makes you do everything?
I work in a tourist attraction, specifically an observation deck. My job is incredibly easy. I greet or say goodbye to people entering or leaving the elevator and make sure to close the deck with my coworkers once it's closing time. I have a co-worker who's incredibly unpleasant and to that a complete slacker. When she's told to be in the same post as me when it gets busy she will randomly leave for 15 20 minutes, come back late from lunch to relieve me and just now, leave early without a word while I'm left alone upstairs to close the whole observation deck. My managers don't care about her behavior because they avoid confrontation as much as possible.  I am starting to get fed up with the fact that people like her are taking advantage of me and always getting their way while I have to be the one covering them. It's a very easy job and yes boring at times, but I just feel used and stupid. What can I do to stop this? She is very aggressive with confrontation and a complete narcissist so I'm not sure if I should talk to my director or my manager of just her, even though I'm pretty sure none of these options will do anything.
