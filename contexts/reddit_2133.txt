Inside the elite college's decision room
AO: "She had 6.4 GPA and all A's. Who would like to admit?"  
Everyone: ...  
AO: "Waitlist then."

AO: "Before her AP chemistry exam she learned her father had an affair with a 23 year old prostitute. How many would like to admit?"  
Everyone: ALL raise hand

"[When voting to offer admission,] there are times honestly where I'm not sure **why I put my hand up or failed to put my hand up.** I'm kind of going with my **gut** here." ~ Tom Parker, Dean of Admissions at Amherst College.

If you don't get into your dream college, just know how absurd and arbitrary the admission process is. We pour our heart into perfecting our essays, activities, academics only to be judged "by gut" by these so-called gatekeepers.
