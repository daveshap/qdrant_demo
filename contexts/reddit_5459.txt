Moving from construction to IT, advice?
I’m heavily considering moving to IT. I used to code a lot in my free time and just kind of fizzled out of it but with all this COVID stuff, I just don’t want to become a statistic. I figured I could use this time to move into an office environment and maybe even work from home in the meantime.

Is the Google program on Coursera worth it? I know getting my A+ would essentially be the first move.

I’m willing to get my degree but I’d like to start out sooner and then build.
