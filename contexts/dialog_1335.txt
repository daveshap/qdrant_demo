MRS. DICKSON: What's this?
CLUETT: My apartment.
MRS. DICKSON: I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
CLUETT: Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
MRS. DICKSON: No. I know the answer to that one. I think you'd better take me home.
CLUETT: What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
MRS. DICKSON: No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important dealsâ€” I think I will have a drink.
CLUETT: Good for you. Come on.
MRS. DICKSON: You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
CLUETT: Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
MRS. DICKSON: What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
CLUETT: A misunderstood bachelor.
CLUETT: And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
MRS. DICKSON: I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
CLUETT: I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
MRS. DICKSON: Why, Matt!
CLUETT: What are you doing here?
MATT: The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
CLUETT: Oh, yeah?
