I need your advice
Hey everyone. What would your advice be to a young female student who wants to do her masters in the US or Canada? I still have 1 year left to graduate and I’m studying chemical engineering. I’m not a an American or Canadian citizen and my dad doesn’t want to support me so I’ll need a full-ride scholarship.
