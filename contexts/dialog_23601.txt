JACKIE: Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
GEORGE: Did Lester know about him?
JACKIE: There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
JACKIE: George...
GEORGE: I just have to do one little thing.
JACKIE: If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
GEORGE: I won't screw you up.
JACKIE: George... how about Felicia?
GEORGE: What?
JACKIE: Did you?
GEORGE: Did I what?
JACKIE: You know what I'm talking about.
GEORGE: Hey, I don't tell.
JACKIE: Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
GEORGE: Yeah?
JACKIE: Well, did you or didn't you?
GEORGE: Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
JACKIE: You did, didn't you?
GEORGE: Baby...
JACKIE: You did, I know you did.
GEORGE: One of my few virtues is discretion.
JACKIE: You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
JACKIE: George...
GEORGE: Yeah, baby...
JACKIE: You're a genius.
