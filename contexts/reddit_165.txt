Need some girl advice here
I’m 16M and am straight. I’ll try to put in as much detail as possible. 

So I have a crush on this girl (also 16) who goes to my school. We share an art class. We are sorta friends who can sorta talk. It’s usually just “Hey how u doin” sort of conversations. I have her number. I know some of her interests like guitar and soccer. 

Ok. So I approached her this Wednesday’s and we had a conversation and then I said “hey maybe we should hang sometime.” To which She responded “yeah, definitely”. We continue to be on friendly terms, BUT she hasn’t answered any of my texts for the last 4ish days. 

Also there’s a dance coming up in a month. 

I just want your take on the situation. Please help. I’m kind of confused.

Feel free to DM/PM me if you feel it would be easier to give advice that way, or if you want more clarity.
