gf broke up with me
Some days ago my gf broke up with me because of my stupid depression, just when I was trying to get out and being happy most of the time, she calls me, tells me she wants to see me and me missing her ( went back from brazil ) went the next day to see her.
She tells me that she can’t handle me anymore, that I didn’t seem to care about my depression and that she doesn’t want to be with me anymore. I didn’t say a word, just fucking cried on the restaurant table. After saying goodbye to her and telling her I’ll be okay, trying not to cry, I buy some blades ( y’know where this is going ) and walk home. You know what I do with those blades so there’s no need to write it. I just erased all my accounts, I’m trying to forget everyone I knew ‘cause I can’t do anything but remember her and it fucks me up. I can’t do anything to not think about her and it’s killing me. I had depression for 4-5 years and now, it’s worse than ever for that fucking things she had to say. I really need someone to tell me nice things again, It’s not gonna cure me but at least I hope you guys can help, I’m desperate for some form of dealing with this, please.
