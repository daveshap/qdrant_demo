What are some policies that the Afghan government can implement than can affect the country positively in a socio-economic sense?
To the extent that I know Taliban seem to be [growing in strength](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-03-23/afghan-taliban-signal-growing-strength-with-capture-of-key-southern-district). And last year, opium production has risen by [3%](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37743433). And literacy rate has gone slightly up from 32% to [38.2%](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html) since 208. These are some of the signs of stagnation, as it were. 

So my question is: are there historically proven policies or strategies in general that can affect positively a country like Afghanistan? Also, if there's anything the United States can do?
