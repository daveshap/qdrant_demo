BUDDY: Hey, you left your book back there.
CINDY: Thanks. I'm Cindy.
BUDDY: So, I see you're really into spooks.
CINDY: No. I never date outside my race.
BUDDY: I meant you're into ghosts.
CINDY: Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
BUDDY: So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
CINDY: Yeah.
BUDDY: Maybe we can study together or something.
CINDY: I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
CINDY: But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
BUDDY: Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
CINDY: Okay. See you later, friend.
