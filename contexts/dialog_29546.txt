RHONDA: Listen, got a question for you. Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
VAL: Around here? Why would they?
RHONDA: Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs. You know, they measure vibrations...
VAL: Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
RHONDA: Yeah, well, I'm getting what I refer to scientifically as weird vibes." every sensor I've got is giving me strange readings. I mean
EARL: Well, we'll ask around. Let you know if we hear of anything.
RHONDA: Thanks. God, I hope they're not screwed up. I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
EARL: No problem. Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
EARL: You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
VAL: What the hell do we know about seismographs?
EARL: Nothing. But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
VAL: Why?
EARL: Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
VAL: Well, sure.
EARL: ...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
VAL: Tammy Lynn Baxter.
EARL: Don't matter. They're all the same: dead weight. Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails. Make my skin crawl!
VAL: Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
EARL: I thought you called it your pecker. Look, don't make the mistake I made. Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me? Here with you.
