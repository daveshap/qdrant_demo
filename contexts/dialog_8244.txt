MADOX: Of course. Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
CLIFTON: Oh no, really. She has her book.
MADOX: I won't hear of it. None of us will.
MADOX: Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us. We're not accustomed to the company of women.
KATHARINE: Not at all. I was thoroughly enjoying by book. Please. Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
CLIFTON: The team is in mourning, darling.
KATHARINE: Oh really?
MADOX: I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
KATHARINE: How awful. What will you do?
MADOX: A more modest expedition, or even wait a year. Remind our families we still exist.
CLIFTON: Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
MADOX: Very much so. We are all, save my friend here.
