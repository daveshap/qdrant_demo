WRIGLEY: I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
MILES: HA!
WRIGLEY: ...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
MILES: Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
WRIGLEY: She could buy and sell you ten times over.
MILES: She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
MILES: Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
WRIGLEY: What...?

MILES: I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
