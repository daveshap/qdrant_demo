TRON: Flynn... Where's Ram?
FLYNN: I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
TRON: This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
YORI: Then I owe you some thanks...
FLYNN: No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
TRON: Wrote the...?
FLYNN: It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.
YORI: A User -- in our world?
FLYNN: Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
TRON: But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
FLYNN: You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
TRON: Then...
FLYNN: Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
TRON: Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
FLYNN: I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
TRON: Stranger and stranger...
BIT: You said it.
FLYNN: So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
