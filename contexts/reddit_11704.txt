Bed bugs are ruining my life
I had roomates who were disgusting not because they got bed bugs, but because they were incapable of following the instructions to get rid of them. I have now been dealing with bed bugs for several months and finally ended up moving out and thought that maybe, just maybe my life would get better.

Well it turns out my boyfriend now has them at his parents house, so I obviously offered to cover the pest control because it is on me that he got them and I feel SO TERRIBLE.  I am just so afraid, what stops them from coming back here? Are they really this impossible to beat? I just feel like I will never be able to get rid of them and I don't know what to do.

I can barely sleep, I have classes starting soon and with working 2 jobs and school I just don't know how to handle all this stress. I feel like I will never be able to find a way out of it, just feel miserable and disgusting and worst of all defeated. From what I read even after months of treatments some people don't get rid of them, or they resurge. Worst of all it's not happening to me, but to people I love and now I am afraid it is spread into my new apartment and maybe even my parents house and it just seems like there will be no end. 

TLDR: Fuck Fuck Fuck Fuck FUCK bed bugs.
