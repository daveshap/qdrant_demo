Co working Space DB architecture I am trying to build a platform to share the empty desks in an office with someone outside the premises to utilize the space and generate some revenue. I am thinking of three major roles: Member who will book a desk/seat(resources) for any period of time be it hours/days/weeks/months.Member who will list empty spaces in his/her office.Admin who will verify the listed spaces. Only verified spaces can be booked and other Admin related tasks such as managing users/resources etc.I am trying to build this on MongoDB and want to focus on scalability.
