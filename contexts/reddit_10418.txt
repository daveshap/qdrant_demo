I would rather kill myself than grow as a person
I'm fucking done with life man. Life fucking sucks in every which way. I do not want to be honest about who I am. I do not want yo grow. I do not want to accept anything. I do not want responsible. I don't want to work hard or be a part of anyone's life. I don't want to make a difference or contribute to society. Having a career of any kind is too much fucking work. The truth is I'm perfectly happy to be a leech until nobody is willing to help me out. The. I'll logically be on the streets and at that point I will kill myself. But why let it go that far? Why shouldn't I buy a gun ASAP and be done with it before life even has the opportunity to force me to try being responsible and engaging in the world around me, when I want nothing to do with that? I'm a loser and I'm okay with that. Not being a loser is seriously too much work. Giving enough shit to learn useful things is too much work. I just want to kill myself before anyone that knows me figures out that I don't give a shit about my life or other people and I'm not interested in the least in being responsible in any sense of the word.
