Going to completely fuck up my MSc thesis proposal and the relationship with my advisor
I have to submit my MSc thesis proposal in a few days and it's going to be a DISASTER.

Simply put, I thought I only needed to submit a vague research topic that I would then develop more thoroughly while reviewing the literature and such.

Turns out, it has to be a detailed 6-pages proposal where I have to state my research objectives and questions, my method, the state of the art and some references that I will use. I wasn't really aware of this - I mean, I had the document but I wasn't aware of the level of detail I was required to get into. Part of it was poor communication, part was due to me procrastinating and being unmotivated to do anything due to this covid crap which has deeply affected my daily life (I live in a hard-hit area). 

This has also affected the relationship with my advisor, who has been SUPER nice so far - I was really trying to make a good impression on him but I utterly failed and now he thinks I'm a dumbfuck who cannot work like a goddamn adult (and rightly so). 

I am supposed to scramble this project together in less than 3 days, but I don't even have a clear topic in mind and I can't just submit whatever because my advisor wants to see it first and then I'll have to defend it in an online meeting with my committee who will question me about it.

These are crucial deadlines and if I don't meet them, I don't graduate.

My anxiety is through the roof and I cannot concentrate. I'm seriously thinking of giving up altogether because I don't see any possible way to get out of this mess. But giving up now would mean throwing 1.5 years of my life in the garbage and ending up without any academic title in a job market which couldn't possibly be shittier at the moment.

I ask you to please not attack me personally - I am already doing it myself. Do you have any advice on how to deal with this mess?
