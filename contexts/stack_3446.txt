Do I run the risk of not being anonymous with this setup? Basically, I created a gmail account using a VPN, and then created a tumblr associated with that Gmail also using a VPN. However, I am now realizing that tumblr records the type of device I am using and google tracks everything so my browser fingerprint could give me away. I want to know, if I delete the email and the tumblr that I created using a VPN, then install a VM on my laptop, use a VPN on the VM, install Tails and Tor, and then recreate the GMail and Tumblr, how anonymous would I be? Would google then still be able to use a browser fingerprint? Or would tumblr still be able to identify what kind of device is being used?And I also have a VM right now, should I uninstall it and then reinstall it to start fresh so that no previous information could be used. When I last used my VM I didn't have a VPN on
