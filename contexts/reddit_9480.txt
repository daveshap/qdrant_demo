A little money game I like to play with myself
Last year I got very frustrated with my ex going to the bar every night while we were essentially living in poverty. His excuse was that it was "only $5" on his way home. Having used the 'envelope system' and other jar methods to save money before, I used his excuse as a motivator to save money. I taped up a coffee can with duct tape and poked a slit in the top of it. On an index card I wrote out a tiny calendar from then (September) to the end of the year. I decided I would "just" contribute $5/day for as long as I could.  Everytime I put in a $5 increment I would cross out the days. So $20 was 4 days, etc.

It seemed unmanageable, but I made more than my ex and figured I would try.

I was paid weekly so every Friday I would hit up the ATM and try to get $40 out for my jar. Obviously this is a lot of money to many of us, but I tried. In October I was offered a few days of OT and the option to come in an hour early every day, so this hour was my $5/day (I was making $12.88/hr so after taxes and etc) and any extra days was catch up money. 

Because this money was out of my account, out of sight, and possibly it represented that I was committed to not just drinking away all my money, I was able to save up enough money to leave my ex! Lol, but in all seriousness with a little luck getting OT I saved $150/mo for several months doing this when I thought it was pretty impossible.

If it's in your account, you might spend it, but even doing just $1/day (getting $20 out of the ATM every two or three weeks), you can put the money away and forget about it.  $365 in a year doesn't seem like much, but many of us have had less in our accounts this month.

Hope this helps someone. I am going to start another jar, I'm thinking $3/day because since I got a good job again I am always tempted to get coffee in the morning.
