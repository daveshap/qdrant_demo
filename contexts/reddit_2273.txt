For you waitlisters at these schools:
I just declined offers of admission to UCSB, UCSD, Duke, Northeastern, Northwestern, Barnard, Mount Holyoke, Smith, and Columbia (this one hurt a lot).

I hope one of you guys get my spots! Best of luck to you all in the remainder of high school, college, and your professional and personal lives!
