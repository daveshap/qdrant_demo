JACK: Yeah. Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting. I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
OPERATOR: Please hold, Sergeant...
EXLEY: I need to speak to you.
JACK: Give me a minute, will ya?
JACK: Damnit... <u>What</u>?
EXLEY: I want you to follow Bud White.
JACK: Even I'm not that crazy.
EXLEY: It's not a request. I need to know what White knows. Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.' Permanently.
JACK: Yesterday that might've meant something. Pull me off. You'd be doing me a big favor.
EXLEY: Yesterday yes, today no. What happened last night?
JACK: Transfer me, suspend me. Just leave me alone.
EXLEY: You make a mistake?
JACK: Yeah. My whole life.
EXLEY: Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
JACK: I ain't a priest, Lieutenant. I can't hear your confession.
EXLEY: Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
JACK: What?
EXLEY: It's a simple question.
JACK: You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
