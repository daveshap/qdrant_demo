Rejection due to lack of experience
I’ve just been rejected from my dream job after making it to the second round of interviews. I received really positive feedback where they told me I should be proud of my conduct in the interview, I answered the questions well and asked excellent questions, but they would be going for someone with more experience. This is disappointing as the job did not specify experience and they knew from the start that I didn’t have any experience. It’s a really competitive industry and it’s so hard to get the experience, I thought this would be my chance to get some experience! 

Any guidance or reassurance would be grateful!

Edit: I’ve asked the company if they do internships or have any other opportunities for me to gain experience.
