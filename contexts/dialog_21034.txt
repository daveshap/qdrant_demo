CONROY: Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
STEW: Gloria Golden?
CONROY: Yeah, little Gloria.
STEW: The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
CONROY: Right - for the first time this year.
STEW: Well - it's only April.
CONROY: Come on, get going, get going!
STEW: Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
CONROY: Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
STEW: All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
CONROY: What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
STEW: I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
