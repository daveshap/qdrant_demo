FLEMMING: OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
BORK: Where are his pants?
FLEMMING: Who knows?
FLEMMING: This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO: Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
FLEMMING: We'll get you whatever you want. Get that other kid. We might need him.
BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO: Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
