"I am not always very attached to being alive" | An Article About Passive Suicidal Idealization
My girlfriend just sent me [this post](https://theoutline.com/post/7267/living-with-passive-suicidal-ideation).

She and I both teeter the line of depression and sometimes, I find myself unable to understand her. My depression comes out in bursts and tears and when it's happening, it's easy to see and hear and feel. For her, I think it's something different. She told me this article really put her feelings into words and made her feel like someone else understood and that someone else was facing the same feelings she was.

I wanted to share it here so that others could see it and maybe be comforted by those words as well.

I hope you are all doing well, genuinely and truly, and that something is making you smile today.
