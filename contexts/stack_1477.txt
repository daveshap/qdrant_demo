Multiple lights dimming using single TRIAC zero detcetion module We know well we can dim single lights using single TRIAC module with the help of PWM signals from controller. My question is, I want to control the lights which are placed on hall. Let us consider 15-20 bulbs.Is it possible to control single PWM signal and single TRAIC module? We need to consider only current value of TRIAC module? What are all the hardware points should be consider at the time of automate.Which micro-controller is best for home automation? Is it possible to ON/OFF lights using TRIAC module? If its not how to do that?
