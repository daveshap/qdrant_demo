THOMAS J: Well when you get older, you just have to.
VADA: I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
THOMAS J: You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
VADA: It is not.
THOMAS J: Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
VADA: Not true.
VADA: Have you ever kissed anyone?
THOMAS J: Like they do on TV?
VADA: Uh huh.
THOMAS J: No.
VADA: Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
THOMAS J: But, I don't know how.
VADA: Here, practice on your arm like this.
THOMAS J: Like this?
VADA: Uh huh. Okay, enough practice.
VADA: Close your eyes.
THOMAS J: But then I won't be able to see anything.
VADA: Just do it.
THOMAS J: Okay, okay.
VADA: Okay on the count of three.
