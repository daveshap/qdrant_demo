Crashland onto a new planet: Origin of the Legal System? I've been researching the origins of my world's legal system. I'm trying to develop it over time in a somewhat logical and organic manner and I've come to realise that I don't yet have a clear idea of the starting point of my cultures legal system. In trying to research examples I have managed to seperate my scenario into different yet related examples. A civilian cruiseship crashes into a deserted island or is stranded adrift at sea. A civilian spaceliner crashlands onto a deserted planet or is stranded adrift in space.Rescue will take weeks/months. It is not expected to be immediate. The captain and trained crew initially took control during the initial emergency (as expected). What happens after the initial emergency is over...What law applies to the crew and civilian survivors during this extended emergency period? Law of the ship's country or planet of registration?International Maritime Law?Martial-like Law?Some sort of Colonial-like law?Question - Is this something that one could expect to have already been codified into Law or is it something that each disaster situation will deal with uniquely: the survivors and crew (and author) have to figure it out for themselves?Notes for Answers: The time period of these scenarios is near future, using past- and current-day precedent to base the legal system on.Answers can use either sea/space scenario or both. I believe the scenarios are similar enough to avoid being too broad, and by combining them into one question it allows space answers to build on historical examples rather than pure opinion based speculation into the future.If the answer is \"it depends\" (which I truly don't mind), the answer that explains the major legal variables/issues at play would be accepted.
