How do i cope with un-ending sadness
So my partner has been dealing with sadness and suicidle thoughts all their entire life its so extremely hard to help them i do help every time we are together its perfect absolutely perfect for both of us i am everything to them and i help as much as i possibly can but theres only so much i can do as we arent together every single minute. they have been hurt by their previous partner and emotional damage from their moms emotional and physical abuse in the past ranging from brith i think until her 5th grade year thats when the physical abuse (slapping cornering shoving head under bathtub water pushing into walls) but the emotional abuse has continued until this year about a few months ago their mom has been very extremely nice to her randomly for no reason. My partners depression gets extremely bad she is constantly sad and frequently has suicidle thoughts and gets very overwhelmed with her home life has asthma attacks and panic attacks for apparently no reason. I am running out of ideas i have done everything for her and i am continuing to do so but my mental illnesses sometimes makes it almost impossible to help and vise versa. She had said many times she wants to get better so bad and get out of her house when shes 18 so we can get engaged but she says she cant see a way out i have alot of experience with helping people out of suicide but the longer this goes on the worse i feel about how good of a job i do with her i used to feel very good about our phone conversations because my advice was always perfect she would go from a full blown panic attack anxiety attack to laughing with me making jokes and talking about all the things we were going to do in the future and how to achieve our goals now it seems like they end in her not actually feeling better just acting better or pushing the thoughts away. 
Please help me find ways to help them cope for the 3 more years they have in their house and how to help her get from the ground up as i have to do this 5/7 days now.
