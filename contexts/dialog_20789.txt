JOE: Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
ANDREW: I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
JOE: I'm a law suit.
ANDREW: Not bad.
JOE: Get it?
ANDREW: Let's find you a drink.
ANDREW: What do you want?
JOE: Beer. We need to go over your Q and A.
ANDREW: Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
JOE: Sure. It's fine.
ANDREW: No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
JOE: Thank you.
