Suggestions on Research and Citation Organization / Software?
Friends in STEM Research

I am looking for citation / research organization software... or workflow suggestions.

I've run across Mendeley and Zotero. I've run across UpToDate (rip founder). I've recently been pointed to LaTex and BibTex. I've also run across a thorough explanation of excel spreadsheet based research organization through r/research.

I think what is most important to me is being able to refer to and track authors and subject matter. Also to be able to export the data as a citation page or just be able to export it to excel. 

I'm just curious what everyone's using? Any other recommendations? Why? What is most important to you and your workflow? 

Many thanks for your time.
