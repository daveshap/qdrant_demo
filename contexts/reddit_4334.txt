Does anyone else just not want to be alive but isn’t actively suicidal?
So I’ve just been feeling really depressed in a really long time. I would say last year I was extremely suicidal and I was on the verge of ending my life. But then it got complicated I got help and blah blah... I thought my meds were working after I reached a therapeutic level of 125mg of Zoloft but I’m not sure anymore. These overwhelming feelings are coming back. 

I mean I’m not actively suicidal or anything. But then today my sister asked me where I wanted to live in the future, and the first thing that cam to mind is that I didn’t want even live. I’m just so tired of this perpetual cycle of shit. It’s really getting draining.

 Anyways does anyone else feel this way, dead inside a little I guess. And do you guys think my meds aren’t working? I was okay until like 4 PM today. I would appreciate your opinion.

And I’m totally fine so you don’t need to message me, please save it for someone in urgent need! I am receiving regular therapy and am well supported :)
