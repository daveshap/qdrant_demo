SEYMOUR: What are you doing here?
ENID: I had to see you.
SEYMOUR: What's up?
ENID: Can you at least let me in?
SEYMOUR: Uh... sure... come in.
ENID: Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
SEYMOUR: What's the matter?
ENID: Do you have anything to drink?
SEYMOUR: Uh... I think there's some root beer...
ENID: What about this?
SEYMOUR: That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
ENID: FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
ENID: You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
SEYMOUR: I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
ENID: Where did you get this?
SEYMOUR: Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my old time thingamajigs.""
ENID: Jesus, how can you stand her?
SEYMOUR: God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
ENID: That's great! Half-empty" - that's what I like about you
SEYMOUR: If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
ENID: What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
SEYMOUR: I'm just being realistic.
ENID: At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
SEYMOUR: I hate sports.
ENID: How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
SEYMOUR: You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
ENID: Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
SEYMOUR: I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
ENID: I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
SEYMOUR: Yeah, sure. Of course.
ENID: ...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
SEYMOUR: What about Joe?
ENID: Oh yeah... and Dana... You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
SEYMOUR: Yeah, well I like you too...
ENID: You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
SEYMOUR: What?
ENID: I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
SEYMOUR: I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
ENID: It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
SEYMOUR: Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
ENID: You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
SEYMOUR: I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
ENID: I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
SEYMOUR: So where would we go?
ENID: Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
SEYMOUR: I dunno, I...
ENID: I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
SEYMOUR: What do you want?
ENID: What do you want?
SEYMOUR: I-I-I...
ENID: What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!
ENID: God, Dana's going to kill you!
SEYMOUR: ...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
ENID: What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
SEYMOUR: I will if you want to.
ENID: No... forget it...
SEYMOUR: I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
ENID: Yeah, well... me neither...
SEYMOUR: You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
ENID: I was just thinking out loud... I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
SEYMOUR: But, I...
ENID: Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
