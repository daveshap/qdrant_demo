USB-C to Displayport cable or adapter I'm using MacBook pro 2017 15 inch and i just got 3x DELL U2518D UltraSharp monitors to connect to my macbook pro.What I actually need is best possible solution to connect this external monitors to my macbook pro. Should i use USB-C to DisplayPort adapter or should i go with USB-C to DisplayPort Cable? What is difference? Is cable better? Or adapter?
