JACK: Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
ALAN: I don’t think you’re hearing me.
JACK: Oh, I’m hearing you, Alan. That’s not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine. And I don’t care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back... So do yourself a favor and don’t get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
