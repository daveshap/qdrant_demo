LYSSA: I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
VOICE OF THE BEAST: Then look!
LYSSA: It's a lie!
VOICE OF THE BEAST: These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
LYSSA: He will not!
VOICE OF THE BEAST: Then he will die!
VELLA: You too are lonely.
COLWYN: I ache with it.
VELLA: Let me comfort you.
COLWYN: I cannot take comfort when she has none.
VELLA: Then give me comfort. Sleep with me tonight.
COLWYN: I cannot betray my bride.
VELLA: One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me. Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
COLWYN: I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
VELLA: You will not, then?
COLWYN: I cannot.
