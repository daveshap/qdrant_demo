WILL: You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
VIOLA: What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
WILL: To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
VIOLA: You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
WILL: Then I will go with you.
VIOLA: You cannot, Wessex will kill you
WILL: I know how to fight!
VIOLA: Stage fighting! Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
