If a girl tells you that you're cool and touches your shoulder a lot does that mean she likes you?
A little background: So last college semester, I hung out a lot with this girl.  I had a crush on her when I saw her.  We were put into the same group in one of my classes.  Now I'm shy and I didn't initiate conversation.  One day, we were meeting as a group for a class project.  We had a library study room and there were four of us.  We worked for a while and the other two group members left.  When it was just me and the girl i like, she started a conversation with me.  We really started talking and the conversation just seemed natural.  Then one of the other group members came back and we didn't talk anymore.  As the semester progressed we hung out more.  One day we were in a study room together until 6:30.  So to my question, one time when we were sitting and talking she told me "you're cool".  It caught me off gaurd but I recovered and told her she was cool too.  Then as more time has gone on, she'd occasionally touch my shoulder and in one instance she briefly and very lightly grabbed my arm as she walked by me.  Are these signs that she likes me possibly?
