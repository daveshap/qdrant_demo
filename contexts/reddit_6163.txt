How long into a new job until you feel like you are up to speed?
I started a new job on Monday, and I am incredibly happy and thankful even without the current COVID19 situation. I was laid off at my other job in Feb due to restructuring, and I landed this job just in time and they are paying me $30,000 more per year than the company I left.

It has elevated my financial situation to a place I didn't dream of being until my 30s (I'm mid 20's right now). That being said, I want to make sure I do the best job I can so I don't lose it.

Problem is, I don't yet actually know what I'm actually going to "do" at my job. The first 3 days have just been sitting in on meetings to get a feel of the culture and how departments interact. As far as I can tell, on a basic level, my job is order fulfillment/prioritization/demand planning. I have 5 years experience so I understand a lot of the context of what people are talking about in these meetings, I just don't know what I'll actually be doing on my own say 6 months from now.

Do you experience this when you start a new job? Kind of has a 'fake it till you make it feel'
