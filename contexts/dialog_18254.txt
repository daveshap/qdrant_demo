LUCY: Don't fight.
OLD MAN: My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
LUCY: He should pay.
OLD MAN: I don't know.
LUCY: He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
OLD MAN: Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
FELIX: I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
OLD MAN: You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
ROSE: Will you live here?
LORETTA: No.
ROSE: Why not?
LORETTA: Pop don't like Johnny.
ROSE: So we'll sell the house.
LORETTA: I got married before, you didn't sell.
ROSE: Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
LORETTA: I'm thirty-seven years old.
ROSE: What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
LORETTA: Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
ROSE: And we'll sell the house.
LORETTA: I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
ROSE: No. He don't.
