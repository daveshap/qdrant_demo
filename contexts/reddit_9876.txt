MBA worth it in Higher Education? (Administration)
Hello,

I graduated with an undergrad degree in Business Management, worked for a major retailer as an operations manager for just over a year and then transitioned back to my Alma Mater as an Assistant Director of Operations for the Admissions department.

I am really loving my new position and could see myself working in Higher Education Administration for a long time. One of the benefits for working for the university is having access to a 70% tuition deferral, so I could essentially pursue a graduate degree for a fraction of what I spent on my undergrad degree.

My first thought is to go for an MBA as my undergrad degree already completes the first group of core classes, either in Business Analytics or Operations/Logistics, but I've heard that an MBA is only worth it from a top-school, which isn't a real possibility right now. Have you or anyone you've known seen an MBA be useful while working through the ladder in Higher Education? Are there other graduate programs that would be more beneficial for this field?

Thanks!
