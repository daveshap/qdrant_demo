Have you ever postponed crying and then couldn't cry later?
So I had a crappy day, was condemned in public and I controlled myself from crying. It was a success! But I still felt like crying and the feeling of sadness/anger/misunderstood was(and still) stuck inside me. I waited until I could get back home to cry. However, when I get back I'm too tired to cry? Does that make sense ðŸ˜‚
