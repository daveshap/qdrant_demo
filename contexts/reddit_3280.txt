Being underpaid compared to a less experienced colleague. What should I do?
I have recently been told by a colleague (who joined the company this calendar year), that she is earning almost 15% more than me. Now, when I started I was not in much of a position to negotiate and was quite flatly told there was no budget to go higher on it. At this point I had a MSc but only a couple of internships to my name, my colleague had an MSc and one year of work experience in a similar company. So to an extent I understand why she would be earning more than me, although I do think the increase is somewhat shocking given she didn't negotiate her deal. After a year, I was given a 3% increase. I am trying to figure out what to do in this situation, as I feel I am not being fairly compensated for my work. I have been there two years now and am the longest serving member of the team (aside from my boss) by almost 2 years... I take a very active role in teaching new members of the team (which occurs a lot due to some very high turnover of staff, for varying reasons.. none to my knowledge due to any issues with the company or compensation). Yet I'm being paid significantly less than a colleague with a year less experience.

I approached my boss about this on Friday, who has said that I will be getting the usual increase (I am pretty sure it's just an inflation based increase) and that they have a separate pot of money for promotions but that they don't think they can tap into that as it would not be a promotion (I have been turned down for this recently). They said they are going to ask to find out if there is anything they can do about it as they know it's not much of a motivation.

I'd like to get some advice on how to handle this/what you would do in my situation.
