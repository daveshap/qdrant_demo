Impostor Syndrome
I'm in my early 30s, in my fifth year in higher ed after transitioning from media (and corporate hell, briefly) and managing a small staff of student workers, including two graduate assistants (one older than I am). I was Assistant Director of Admissions at my previous institution and am now the Assistant Director of Student Engagement somewhere else. 

While I'm confident in both my work and ability to lead, I struggle with the fact I don't have advanced degrees. I majored in English and was a digital media fellow at ASU a few years after graduating, but I sometimes suffer from impostor syndrome. 

I intend to work in higher ed forever, absolutely love what we do, and I plan on continuing my formal education. I've been able to accomplish a lot in these five years (conference presentations, policy changes, advocacy, etc.) and am proud of the impact I've had on my students and my institutions. 

But I'm curious if others are in the same boat? How do you tackle impostor syndrome?
