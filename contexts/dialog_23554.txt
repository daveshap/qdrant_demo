ALEX: What is this?
DAVID: Security.
DAVID: From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
DAVID: There was a break-in.
ALEX: Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
DAVID: Doesn't it worry you?
ALEX: No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
ALEX: What's all this for, more security?
DAVID: I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
ALEX: Oh, that'll come in useful.
JULIET: Is this the same stuff you made last week?
ALEX: No, no, it's different.
JULIET: I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
ALEX: It tastes different.
JULIET: I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
DAVID: What? Yes, that's fine.
ALEX: You're sure? There's lots more.
DAVID: No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
ALEX: What's wrong?
DAVID: Nothing.
ALEX: You're not eating.
DAVID: Not eating what?
ALEX: Not eating like you used to, that's what.
DAVID: If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
