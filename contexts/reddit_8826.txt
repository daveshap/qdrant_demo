Given the recent NYT investigation into the Trump family's taxes, what penalties, if any, could be imposed?
The New York Times recently published an [investigative report](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) into the tax evasion schemes used by the Trump family during the 80's and 90's. 


What penalties, if any, could be imposed by the state of New York or others? 

Would these penalties be limited to civil penalties? [It has been reported that because fraudulent tax returns were submitted, there is no statute of limitations keeping the state of New York from recouping funds.](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/409739-deblasio-says-nyc-is-looking-to-recoup-money-from-trump-after)
