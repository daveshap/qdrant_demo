Ubuntu 18.04.1 desktop another graphical issues I'm trying to install Ubuntu 18.04.1 desktop edition on my lenovo ideapad z500 laptop and i'm facing graphical issues. After the grub menu during live USB boot, the image on the monitor shrinks vertically 1/3 of the screen height and the text isn't readable. I've read other posts about Ubuntu graphical issues and haven't found a solution to my problem. I've tried using nomodeset kernel parameter alongside with other i915 and nouveau parameters variations and it didn't help. Also i've tried setting gfxpayload to text that gave no effect either.Could anyone please help to resolve this issue? Or at least clarify if it is possible to boot live Ubuntu 18.04.1 kernel in pure text mode without gfx?P.S. Using Ctrl+Alt+F2 i can see TTY changing but it doesn't do any changes to the graphics.
