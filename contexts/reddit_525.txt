Ok so I need some help
I'm in high school grade 10 if that matters. And I've liked this girl for a really Long time and we've dated from before and I've never been able to get over her. I told her how I feel and she says she still loves me but she wants to stay as we are which is really close friends cause she Doesn't wanna ruin what we have.

So like what do I do I wanna be with her but idk where to go from here. Thanks in advance for anyone who reads this and replies
