BATMAN: A kiss under the misteltoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
CATWOMAN: But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
CATWOMAN: You're the second man who killed me this week. But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
BATMAN: I tried to grab you -- save you --
CATWOMAN: Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
