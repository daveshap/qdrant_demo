LENNY: I just got off the phone with the cops. They called to check you brought the cab in...
MAX: Yeah? So?
LENNY: <u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
MAX: It got crashed! I didn't...
LENNY: I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
VINCENT: It was an accident. You're not liable. Tell him.
MAX: It was an accident. I'm not liable.
