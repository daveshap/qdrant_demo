How to stop or reduce overthinking?
I don't know why, but I have recently started overthinking situations when talking to a potential partner. I usually call up my bestfriend and just have him tell me I'm overthinking the situation. 

It's very simple things like being left on read, responding a couple hours later, and misinterpreting a rescheduled date. It's very simple, and most of it could be that the other person is busy, which is probably the case but my mind decides to hit a line of coke and run all over the place.

Any tips?
