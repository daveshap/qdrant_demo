People who moved from academia to analyst/consulting work what is that like?
I'm abd in sociology and thinking about leaving academia for a number of reasons we could all relate to. But I came to grad school directly from undergrad and have never worked in a "real" job before. Im thinking about analyst or consulting work. Does anyone know what these jobs entail (I've looked up on my own but there's so much variety)? Whats it like moving from academia to private work? Do you wish you had stayed in academia?
