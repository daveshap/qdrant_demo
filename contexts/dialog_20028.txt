PETE: An' all my meals for free...
EVERETT: What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
DELMAR: Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
PETE: What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
EVERETT: Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
PETE: Well that hardly sounds like you...
