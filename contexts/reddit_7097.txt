What are jobs a 17 year old high school student can do that aren't retail or fast food?
I worked 3 weeks in retail. I absolutely hated it. I would rather die than do it again. I got sick, too. Because of all the shit I had to touch. Is there anything besides fast food and retail a high school student can do?
