WALTER: What the hell are you doing there?
ROSEN: Did you and your sister often take naps together?
WALTER: I want you back in your chair! Right now!
WALTER: Don't ever do that again.
ROSEN: All right.
WALTER: I don't like nobody behind my back!
ROSEN: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
ROSEN: Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
WALTER: Nothing.
ROSEN: Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
WALTER: This is garbage!
ROSEN: I'm only asking questions.
WALTER: Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up! I smelled her hair.
ROSEN: What else?
WALTER: That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
ROSEN: You felt pleasure.
WALTER: Yes.
ROSEN: Did you get an erection?
WALTER: I was six years old!
ROSEN: I meant later... when you two took naps.
ROSEN: When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
WALTER: It was a small house.
ROSEN: All right. A small house... with small rooms.
WALTER: I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
CARLOS: I've got some good news.
WALTER: What's that?
CARLOS: Annette will see you.
CARLOS: Aren't you glad?
WALTER: When?
CARLOS: Soon.
WALTER: Next week? The week after?
CARLOS: Early July.
