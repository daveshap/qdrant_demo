Style Sheet Advice I'm working on a style sheet for a series of publications, and am wondering about what's a good rule to set for punctuation and quotation marks.CMOS says that the final period of a quote may be omitted or changed to a comma.My own prejudice is to keep an ending period of the quote if it is a full sentence unless the overall sentence requires something different.e.g. She orders me around, saying things like \"Take out the trash.\" and \"Do the dishes.\" without any concern the fact that I'm actually working when she tells me to do these things.e.g. However, if someone does something bad, and I think, \u201cHe\u2019s a bad person,\u201d it becomes much harder for him to improve.Does this seem like a workable standard?Cheers,Wes
