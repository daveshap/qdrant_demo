KATHRYN: A little melodramatic, don't you think.
SEBASTIAN: I have a flair for drama.
KATHRYN: Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
SEBASTIAN: You wanted an answer to your question.
KATHRYN: Annette?
SEBASTIAN: Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
KATHRYN: Well done.
SEBASTIAN: I thought we should celebrate.
KATHRYN: I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
SEBASTIAN: Ronald?
KATHRYN: Not that it's any of your business but yes.
