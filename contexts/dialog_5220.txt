RICK: Well, this might come in handy.
LASZLO: Thank you.
RICK: Had a close one, eh?
LASZLO: Yes, rather.
RICK: Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
LASZLO: We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
RICK: What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
LASZLO: You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
RICK: Yes, I get the point.
LASZLO: I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
RICK: You seem to know all about my destiny.
LASZLO: I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
RICK: You love her that much?
LASZLO: Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
