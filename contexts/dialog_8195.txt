DEAN: What kind of a question is that?
BLAKE: A direct one.
DEAN: I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use.
SILVERBERG: What's his name?
DEAN: Brill.
BLAKE: Why don't you just call Brill directly.
DEAN: I don't know who he is.
BLAKE: I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
DEAN: Told by whom?
BLAKE: Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
DEAN: Really?
BLAKE: Yes.
DEAN: Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
SILVERBERG: Gentlemen--
DEAN: This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
SILVERBERG: Who would do that?
DEAN: Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
SILVERBERG: Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
DEAN: You're firing me.
SILVERBERG: A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
DEAN: Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
SILVERBERG: Bobby--
DEAN: Fuck off.
