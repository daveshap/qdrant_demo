How can I make myself the owner of a partition? So I installed it on a dual-boot on my Main drive, with the intention of this space being for the os and a few programs as this is my SSD with less space. I went back later and used GParted to make another partition for stuff I want to install on ubuntu on another hard drive, I have done this, and now I'm back in Ubuntu but I can't do anything to the drive as the owner is root. I've looked online for help with this but all I can find is how to edit individual files on a root drive. how do I permanently become the owner?if relevant the file system type is ext3/ext4
