HAROLD: Then speak, by God! Can you fight with words?
PAUL: I don't want to fight you.
HAROLD: Get mad! Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother! Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
PAUL: It's your house, Dad.
HAROLD: Everybody simply evaporates! There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt! I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.
PENELOPE: The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
HAROLD: I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words. I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary. Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope. Tell him to come here.
PENELOPE: No.
HAROLD: No.
HAROLD: And my son, the only son of Harold Ryan--he's going to grow up to be a vanisher, too?
PENELOPE: I don't know. I hope he never hunts. I hope he never kills another human being.
HAROLD: You hope this, too?
PAUL: I don't know what I hope. But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway. You don't know me. You don't know her, either. I don't think you know anybody. You talk to everybody just the same.
HAROLD: I'm talking to you gently now.
PAUL: Yeah. But it's going to get loud again.
