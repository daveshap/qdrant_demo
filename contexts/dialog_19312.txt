ALDYS: Nice.
JOSIE: How long will they watch us for?
ALDYS: Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
JOSIE: Why do they listen to Guy?
ALDYS: : Because he's Guy Perkins. Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
JOSIE: Yeah. Let's do that.
ALDYS: Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
JOSIE: Oh I know.
ALDYS: I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
JOSIE: Hey--I went to Northwestern! Once. To use the bathroom.
