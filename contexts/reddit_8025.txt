Jobs that pay for your masters???
Does anyone know of jobs that help pay for your masters? I recently seen a comment that said they intentionally started working for the school they wanted to go to because it offers reduced tuition for workers. Which makes me wonder if other employees do the same. I know there a few but I think those are generally reserved for getting you bachelor's.


Edit: I want to get an MPP and I am a political science major.
