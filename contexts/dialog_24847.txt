TAYLOR: I don't know what you're talking about!
BARNES: Sure you do. Sending Mac out on a little recon work. How pathetic. Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses. Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
TAYLOR: Look we gave you what you asked for. It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
BARNES: I told you not to try anything smart! I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order! And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
TAYLOR: Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway! Why do you want to kill more innocent people! Why!
