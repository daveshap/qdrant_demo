Windows File Sharing for Local Network Directory accounts in macOS Mojave I'm struggling with how directory services and local Mac accounts interact. I'm hoping to not have to specifically assign the 'Windows File Sharing' option to each user individually or Network Directory group access.Is it possible to share files to Windows clients who have a Local Network Directory (Open Directory) account in macOS Mojave?
