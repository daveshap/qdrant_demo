EMIL: I'm abused. Don't you think?
CUTLER: I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
DUFFY: The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image! This is going to be our Rodney King!
JORDY: What was I supposed to do? The guy tried to mug me. I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
DUFFY: Forgot? You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
JORDY: Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
DUFFY: Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
JORDY: End my career?
DUFFY: How are you going to fight this? Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight. You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do! Gimme your shield.
JORDY: But Chief? Over this??
DUFFY: There's nothing to talk about. Get a good lawyer. You're suspended until your trial.
