Cancelling apartment booking in Switzerland I have made a booking with an apartment in Switzerland. No booking payment was done and I did not share my credit card details with them. But I did fill in the confirmation letter which have my details (passport, address) and signed.According to them, if I would like to cancel the booking I have to pay 80% of the total sum. But since they do not have my credit card details, can I just ignore them? And with this can they give any trouble?
