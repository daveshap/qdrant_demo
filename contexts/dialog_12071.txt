VERGER: In and out. Yes. And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
FRANKLIN: She my foster.
VERGER: She's not the first foster that you've had. <u>Is</u> she?
FRANKLIN: No.
VERGER: Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
FRANKLIN: We got KittyKat...
VERGER: Yes.... yes...
FRANKLIN: ...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
VERGER: Yes. Franklin, you can't live there anymore. With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat. You have to go away.
FRANKLIN: ...who say...?
VERGER: The government says. Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother. The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home. You can't see Mama anymore. Or Shirley. Or Kitty Cat. That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
