RUBY: Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit. They see out the sides. That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
GLORIA: What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
RUBY: Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye. He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
RUBY: You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
GLORIA: I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
RUBY: About Suzie?
GLORIA: Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
RUBY: He used to come around here. He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
RUBY: Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
GLORIA: She still work there?
RUBY: No. Not after that night. I don't know what happened. Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy. Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night. It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away. That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
GLORIA: Was there ever any kind of investigation...
