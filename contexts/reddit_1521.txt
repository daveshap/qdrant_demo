Relationship anxiety and constant worrying, I’m so sick of it
I have no idea how to deal with this anymore, I’m so sick of irrationally worrying about every small thing; worried if she’s happy, worried if she’s going to leave, worried she’s sick of me and my fucking issues, worried when we don’t talk in the immediate moment, worried when she makes a joke, worried when she doesn’t make a joke. I have an abrupt minimally hostile reaction to almost everything, I can’t take a joke anymore and handle change or big plans awfully. I feel like I need to take hours to think about every small thing that happens in our life but I know I can’t do that because you can’t just spend 8 hours every day thinking your feelings out, that’s fucking exhausting. 

Just constant rumination/unsettled feeling with no foundation behind it but my own insecurity & anxiety. I hate this fucking shit.
