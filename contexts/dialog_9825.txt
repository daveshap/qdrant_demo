FORD: How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick? I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob. I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
GRENDEL: Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
GRENDEL: Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection. I'm Julian Grendel.
FORD: Boing. You're one hell of a lip reader.
GRENDEL: Why thank you. It's a Christmas present. That was my sense of humor, everyone. I wish you would fake a laugh. It's easy with a deaf person.
FORD: I knew your father. He was quite...
GRENDEL: An asshole? A swine? A ballistic turd? Pick one. I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company. You see the music is irrelevant in this industry. I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
DON: Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
FORD: I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
GRENDEL: Terrible thing, but good career move. His record sales have gone way up. I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
FORD: I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney. Do you know him?
