JULIET: Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
ROMEO: I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
JULIET: O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
GLORIA: Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
JULIET: Madam, in happy time what day is that?
GLORIA: Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
JULIET: What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
GLORIA: Here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
