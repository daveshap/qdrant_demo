Have you ever just been bad at a job ?
Every job I have ever had I have just been bad at regardless of what it was. I come to work on time, never call in sick, I have a pleasing character from what I have been told but I am just never really good at the work I am doing or any job I have had. Anyone else know someone like this or has had a similar experience. what do you do in a situation where you wanna do good work but it seems like no matter how hard you try you are just not good at the jobs you get. Thanks y'all.
