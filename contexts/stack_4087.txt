In Italy, how to know parking fee before driving into the parking lot? Is there a way to know the parking fee before driving into a parking lot in Italy? In many other countries there are boards with prices at the gateway, so you see the hour rates before you park. I have almost never seen such price boards in Italy. Am I missing something?
