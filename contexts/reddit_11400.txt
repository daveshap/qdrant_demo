I don't have a job and I miss my hamster
I had a hamster. I love my hamster, like seriously, [he's awesome](http://i.imgur.com/eON4v4x). But my partner and I just moved into a new place and they don't allow pets so we had to send him to stay with my partners parents.

Our tenancy here only lasts til August. My fiancee has said that if I can get a new job (I'm unemployed at the moment) we can move out right away to find a place that'll let me keep my hamster. But I can't find any jobs that'll take me. I don't wanna get stuck in retail for the rest of my life but that's all I'm qualified to do and I wanna get out of this house.

There's no food in the house, we barely have money to buy more, I'm depressed, I miss my hamster and I worry that I'm gonna end up in a dead-end job if I end up in any job at all.
