EPPS: Not enough. We're out numbered and out gunned. They'd cut us to shreds.
JAEGER: So good bye, Shi'ites. Thanks for playing. We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
WES: We're American soldiers. We don't abandon people.
JAEGER: Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
WES: You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
JAEGER: I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
EPPS: I don't want to see people killed any more than you. But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
WES: We can't just go off and--
EPPS: There's nothing we can do. We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
