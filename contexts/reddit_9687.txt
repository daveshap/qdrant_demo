International Student Advising- is a student affairs degree what I need?
Hi, I'm new here.
I'm interested in working in international student services/programs for a university, most likely in the US.  I'm interested in international student advising, but I'm contemplating international student services in general, as well as programs like English for international students or study abroad (not necessarily working directly for a university).  I currently live in Japan and am also contemplating related jobs that I could do here (or overseas in general).  

So, my title question asked in a little more detail:  
I have this image in my head that advising is a very specific focus that I would need to decide on from the very beginning.  I think that international student advising is what I am most interested in but I also want to be flexible. 

Does international student advising fall under student affairs in the first place, or should I be looking at other, completely different programs, like perhaps counseling?

Will a student affairs degree with a focus on international student services/programs (as opposed to advising) allow me to do advising within that field, among other things?  

Does such flexibility/mobility within the field even exist, or do I need to have a clear job goal even within, say, international student services/programs upon applying anyway?  I know I am interested in the field, but I'm not sure I want to limit myself to advising.

I apologize if that is one too many questions at once, and I feel that I could word them a little better, but I would really appreciate any comment.  Thank you in advance.
