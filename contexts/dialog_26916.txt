SARAH: What's he like?
REESE: You trust him. He's got that strength. You'd die in a second for John.
SARAH: Well, at least I know what to name him. I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
REESE: John never said much about him. He dies. Even before the war...
SARAH: Stop! I don't want to know. Hold still. So...it was John that ordered you here?
REESE: I volunteered.
SARAH: You volunteered?
REESE: It was an honor. A chance to meet the legend. Sarah Connor. Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid. When you were in hiding, before the war.
