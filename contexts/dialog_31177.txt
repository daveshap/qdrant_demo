CASSANDRA: Here. Mr. Tyler. He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
MIGUELITO: Wonderful! Our new friend from the wild west. Please...
MIGUELITO: Very good, sir! I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
JIM: No, sir... just a businessman.
MIGUELITO: Really? Must be a dangerous business.
JIM: I deal with some tough customers.
