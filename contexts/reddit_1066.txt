Does anyone here also suffer from rejection sensitivity?
If someone looks at me disapprovingly or even talks to me in an unusual tone, I tend to attribute that to them not liking me, and my body goes into fight or flight mode. I'm essentially convinced that everyone hates me and a lot of that is rooted in social anxiety and feelings of incompetency. I've never tried to make friends because I feel that they will not like me. I can't hang out in social groups because I feel that I act awkward, and I'm afraid that if I act awkward that I will be socially rejected. This really affects my life and my relationships with people-- I basically always feel incompetent. I interpret other's behavior through a very biased lens that harms me. My self esteem largely relies on how others feel about me (or rather how I think others feel about me). 

I don't know what to do anymore. This is a big struggle for me. I've attended therapy before, and it's obvious to me that much of this stems from unresolved childhood issues, but idk. I'm just wondering if there's anyone who feels like this because this makes me feel kinda ashamed and dumb.
