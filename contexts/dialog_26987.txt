CHRISTINE: Where'd you get that... ?
NICHOLAS: ... what... ?
CHRISTINE: That gun. That... that's not automatic. The guard had an automatic...
NICHOLAS: What the fuck are you... ?
CHRISTINE: Where'd you get that gun?
NICHOLAS: It's mine...
CHRISTINE: We searched the house.
NICHOLAS: Guess you missed it.
CHRISTINE: Just... wait. Just wait! Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
CHRISTINE: He's got a gun. Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here! Real situation! ... damn it...
NICHOLAS: What are you doing?
CHRISTINE: Nicholas, this is fake. It's all part of the game...
NICHOLAS: Fuck you.
CHRISTINE: Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game. This was all the game.
NICHOLAS: Bullshit. They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
CHRISTINE: No, now wait... think about it. What did you see... ?
NICHOLAS: I saw them kill him!
CHRISTINE: What did you <u>really see</u>? This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies. Please, you've got to believe me... He's got a gun, with real bullets!
NICHOLAS: Stop talking to them!
CHRISTINE: Okay... okay... I put it down. Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door. He's an actor...
NICHOLAS: Stop talking...
CHRISTINE: Nicholas...
NICHOLAS: Shut up!
CHRISTINE: Let me show you...
NICHOLAS: No! You take another step, I'll shoot! They're trying to kill me...
CHRISTINE: You're wrong. You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
CHRISTINE: Think about it! They followed you every step of the way. There was always a safety net. The taxi, there was a diver. At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
NICHOLAS: That's not true...
CHRISTINE: It is. It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money. Nobody stole anything. They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
NICHOLAS: No...
CHRISTINE: Open that door, you'll see. Your brother's there... Conrad. He's there. It's your birthday party...
NICHOLAS: Stop it!
CHRISTINE: Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
NICHOLAS: Don't move, you bitch... !
CHRISTINE: I have to show you...
NICHOLAS: No!
