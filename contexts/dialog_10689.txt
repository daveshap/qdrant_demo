EPPS: You killed them.
MURPHY: It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody. You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
EPPS: So you killed them?
MURPHY: The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
EPPS: And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
MURPHY: I didn't want it to turn out this way.
EPPS: Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
MURPHY: I think I see it pretty well.
EPPS: It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
MURPHY: I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
EPPS: It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
MURPHY: I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
EPPS: I don't give a damn about the gold.
MURPHY: I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
