KIRK: Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
SCOTTY: Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
BONES: You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
KIRK: We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
BONES: I just wish we could cloak the stench.
SAAVIK: Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
KIRK: Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
SAAVIK: And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
KIRK: Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause. How are you feeling?
SAAVIK: I am well, Admiral.
KIRK: You will be in good hands here.
