OZ: Illegal channels? Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
JIM: Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night? That Ariel, whew.
OZ: She's a mermaid, dude.
JIM: Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
OZ: She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
JIM: A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
OZ: Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
JIM: C-Span?
KEVIN: Then she said -- she loves me.
OZ: Oh shit dude, the L-word!
JIM: And you said...
KEVIN: Nothing, I just hugged her back.
JIM: You think she was serious?
KEVIN: I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt.""
