Causes of permanent hand damage and other effects it may have Basically, I have a musician type character who has permanent hand damage in both hands that prevents him from playing instruments. This information can also be used by those who wants to learn about hand damage in general. I want to know what are the different types of hand damage, how they can be caused and what other side effects it may have in day to day life as befits the<blockquote>  How to achieve a specified effect in a defined world, including by the use of biology, technology or magic, while maintaining in-universe consistency</blockquote>part of the guidelines. The end goal is to prevent the musician from playing instruments ever again.They must fit the following criteria:no amputations involved, they may get a lot of physical damage, but the hand should still stay intactmay or may not be from an accidentmay or may not be due to some sort of disease (real life disease)must be permanent, meaning the hands will never be the same ever againhas to be applicable on an average teenager kid (13-19) prior to being disabled, meaning no stuff like old age arthritis or getting shot by alien lasershas to be applicable to modern times (aka 21st century),meaning stuff like cures/techniques that have been invented now are available for the character
