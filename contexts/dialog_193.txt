CUTLER: ...delusions and paranoia.
EMIL: I was all of these.
CUTLER: Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently. No question about that.
EMIL: What about Oleg?
CUTLER: Disappeared. They're looking everywhere. Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
EMIL: No, he is here. Shit...
CUTLER: Don't worry about him. Think about yourself.
EMIL: What about my movie rights? Book rights?
CUTLER: Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
EMIL: What's your cut? How much?
CUTLER: I would say...half. Half is fair.
EMIL: No. No way.
CUTLER: But it's...
EMIL: Thirty-percent. No more. Or I call another lawyer. This is the biggest case of your life. Don't try to negotiate. Thirty percent. Say yes or no.
CUTLER: This is not about money, Emil. I need your trust in me.
EMIL: What else do you need?
CUTLER: I need to know about your background. I need to know about your upbringing. Why you're here.
EMIL: Give me another one, please.
CUTLER: Tell me about yourself. What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
EMIL: My father always degraded me. Killed my self-esteem. And my mother was blind.
CUTLER: Your mother was blind?
EMIL: Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
CUTLER: Back in the Czech Republic?
EMIL: Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind. And my father blamed me for her blindness...
CUTLER: Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
EMIL: Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born. Put it out. Can you put the cigarette out?
EMIL: That's what he did to me. He put cigarettes out on me.
CUTLER: Your father put cigarettes out on you?
EMIL: Out on my back when I was a small boy.
CUTLER: Can I see your back?
