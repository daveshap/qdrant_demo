BEDSOE: Anything from the bank?
DETECTIVE GRELEY: We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
BEDSOE: He had to come from somewhere.
DETECTIVE GRELEY: I think it was England.
BEDSOE: Why?
DETECTIVE GRELEY: I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank. Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
BEDSOE: So?
