KURTZ: No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
WILLARD: You can't have water after morphine.
KURTZ: Still playing by the rules. You're a damn good kiler.
WILLARD: How's the pain?
KURTZ: How's yours?
WILLARD: I can handle it.
KURTZ: Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
WILLARD: What Truth?
KURTZ: The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why? Yes, you know why. Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here. Except me.
KURTZ: Gimme water.
WILLARD: No water.
KURTZ: You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
