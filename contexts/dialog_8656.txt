STAN: It's a good one all right.
PATRICK: What's your bartlett's?
STAN: It's a quote book.

PATRICK: Yeah. Cool.
MARY: The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts.""
PATRICK: Very cool. Trippy.
MARY: I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.

STAN: Yup.
PATRICK: Definitely!
MARY: I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
