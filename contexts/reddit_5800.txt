3rd job interview with a rude, racist owner of company
My first job interview with her she laughed in my face after she asked me what I expected to be paid and I gave her a reasonable amount. She also is a racist. I know this because of reasons that I'd rather not discuss here, but because I'm white, I feel like it would still be horrible for me to work there since I would be complacent in the racism by working for her. Yesterday, I went in for a second interview and I told her I'm glad to be back (a lie, but i NEED a job - been unemployed for 3 months) and she said something along the lines of, "Well you're not hired yet so don't be too excited". So therefore rude again. I used to be a teacher and trying to switch into business but she kept asking me if I could be her kid's nanny or come babysit for her. That's not the job I'm interviewing for - I'm interviewing for an administrative assistant role. It was very strange. I kept brushing it off and going back to how I'd like to join her company.

She asked me to come in today (it's just after 1am right now) at 9am to get me trained/see if it's a good fit on both sides and I agreed, but now I really don't want to go. How shitty would it be for me to cancel? She has my information and her company is Fortune 500 type so I'm not sure how far her influence in this city goes. 

Also not sure if it's better to stay unemployed and keep looking for jobs (I have a couple of interviews lined up but this process takes a month+) or if I should just settle for working for a shitty person.

Extra info: I'm also in school but only taking one class a semester. I also am not exactly strapped for money, I'm more worried about my unemployment gap... I've thought about using the classes I'm taking as an excuse for why I took a break from working, but I don't know if that is good enough.
