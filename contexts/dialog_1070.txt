WOODWARD: What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
BERNSTEIN: --I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
WOODWARD: --it was fine the way it was--
BERNSTEIN: --it was bullshit the way it was--
WOODWARD: --I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
BERNSTEIN: --what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
WOODWARD: --and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
BERNSTEIN: --you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
WOODWARD: --Bradlee went to Harvard--
BERNSTEIN: --they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
WOODWARD: --I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
BERNSTEIN: --mine's better--
WOODWARD: --no way--
BERNSTEIN: --read 'em both and you'll see--
