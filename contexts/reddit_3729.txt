It’s starting to become very clear to me that boyfriend material and hookup material are two different things
Being boyfriend material is something that most guys can work on and have value as. That’s what all this bettering yourself pep talk is aimed at: to make men more confident and better providers so they can be better boyfriend material. As long as your personality isn’t absolutely awful, if you’re decently winning at basic life stuff you probably have some value as boyfriend material. Being hookup material is different. That’s more of a you have it or you don’t kind of thing. And a lot of men don’t have it. Men have much less control over that I think. It’s a roll of the dice and a much more difficult skillset to learn if you don’t already have it. So basically I think it’s frequently easier to be boyfriend material than hookup material.

So a lot of guys are boyfriend material but not hookup material. Which sets things up for a lot of confusion and frustration for these guys over why they are apparently not wanted when all the cool kids are hooking up all the time. Then eventually most of them get settled for. I think a lot of these are the original “nice guys finish last” type of nice guys. But it’s not that they’re nice. At least not entirely, maybe being overly nice factors into the issue. They just aren’t hookup material for some reason.

Basically these guys put up with a lot of disrespect over nasty valuations. It’s kind of fucked up

Edit: Apparently it’s necessary to say that I’m a man
