Localization of a point on a line in QGIS I'm relatively new to the GIS field. I have several polylines (streets) and would like to locate stations on these lines. The start and end points of the lines, the length of the line and the distance of the stations from the starting point are given. I'm looking for the coordinates for the stations. With GRASS and PostGIS there are probably possibilities. Does anyone have good explanations?
