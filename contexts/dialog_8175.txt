RACHEL: How's the trout?
DEAN: It tastes like fish.
RACHEL: It is fish.
DEAN: I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
RACHEL: Do you like fish?
DEAN: Not that much.
RACHEL: Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
DEAN: When do I get to meet him?
RACHEL: DePinto?
DEAN: Brill.
RACHEL: Never.
DEAN: That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
RACHEL: What answer were you--
DEAN: Soon". Or at least sooner than never."
RACHEL: It's how he works.
DEAN: Brill?
RACHEL: Yes.
DEAN: So you've said.
DEAN: Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
RACHEL: I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
DEAN: Other than Brill.
RACHEL: Other than me.
DEAN: Why would I--
RACHEL: Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
DEAN: I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
RACHEL: He doesn't work that way.
DEAN: I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
RACHEL: You're not.
DEAN: How can I be sure.
RACHEL: I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
DEAN: Thank you.
RACHEL: Eat your fish.
DEAN: Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
DEPINTO: What can I do for you?
DEAN: Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
DEPINTO: Is this a fuckin' joke?
DEAN: I don't believe it is, no.
DEPINTO: Why the hell would I--
DEAN: I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
DEPINTO: That ain't me.
DEAN: It's not?
DEPINTO: You don't know who the fuck--
DEAN: That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
DEPINTO: This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
DEAN: You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
DEPINTO: You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
DEAN: That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
DEPINTO: I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
DEAN: Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
