BILLY: I stopped by the station a while ago. I stared at the bus. I could almost hear the kids inside. There was a lawyer there. He told me he'd gotten you signed up. Is that true?
RISA: Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
RISA: Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
BILLY: Risa, I serviced that bus. At the garage. There's nothing wrong with it.
RISA: ...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
BILLY: You believe that?
RISA: I have to.
BILLY: Why?
RISA: Because I have to.
BILLY: Well I don't.
RISA: Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses? That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
BILLY: Yes.
RISA: Why did you do that, Billy?
BILLY: You think that caused the accident, Risa? That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer. Or maybe they're the same thing.
