Adverbs of location after be verb <blockquote>  We're upstairs.</blockquote>In this sentence, is upstairs a noun or an adverb? I think it's the latter because if it was a noun, the sentence is missing a preposition before upstairs. To my knowledge, in a SVC sentence, only nouns or adjectives can be a complement. Are adverbs of location, or locatives, exceptions to this rule?
