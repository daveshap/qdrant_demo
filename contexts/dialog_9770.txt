GILLETT: You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
FLETCH: She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
GILLETT: I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
FLETCH: It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
GILLETT: Until she remarries, Fletch.
FLETCH: Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
GILLETT: I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
FLETCH: She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
GILLETT: You should have proved that in a court of law.
FLETCH: My lawyer was a bum.
GILLETT: I agree.
FLETCH: I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
GILLETT: You may be right.
FLETCH: Are you serious?
GILLETT: That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
FLETCH: Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
