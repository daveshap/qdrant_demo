THORWALD: Hello.
JEFF: Did you get my note?
JEFF: Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
THORWALD: Who are you?
JEFF: I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
THORWALD: Why should I?
JEFF: For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
THORWALD: I don't know what you mean.
JEFF: Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
THORWALD: I only have a hundred dollars or so.
JEFF: That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
