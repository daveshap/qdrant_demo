I have literally zero motivation
Right now, I'm in a great place if you look at it from the outside. I'm in the middle of a PhD, have a great girlfriend, no money issues and a bunch of decent friends.

Throughout May and June, I ended up working basically every waking hour to try and meet some paper deadlines, which I eventually managed to meet. I actually got accepted into the conference for one, which I was quite excited about. I then took a week of doing "work", but nothing to do with my PhD and just some time off it to concentrate on a project I wanted to do. 

Fast forward to now, and I've done, well, basically nothing on it for the past month. I just don't have any drive whatsoever to move on with it from here. I only currently have a vague direction of where I want to take it, which probably doesn't help, but I can't seem to be able to just sit down and think or do anything on it to progress properly. When I'm sat in front of my work, there's just no drive to actually do anything, and my mind is just cloudy as to what to do with it.

Ultimately, there's more deadlines coming up for conferences (in a month and two months), which I have nothing for at the moment, and at this rate *won't* have anything for, and at the moment, I just don't want to do it. This then leads to nothing really happening, which leads to more anxiety about the fact I've not done anything, which leads to more of a motivation slump. I'd take a holiday, but I'd feel shit doing so since I've not really got anything done for the past N weeks.

Ultimately, I feel like I'm in a good position in life, I just don't want to do this any more. Part of me wants to finish my PhD, because otherwise it's a wasted two years (which I'd also have to explain to employers...) and I *do* want to finish it, but another part of me just wants to jack it in and go and find a job somewhere instead.
