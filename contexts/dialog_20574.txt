DANNY: How could you do this?
RAFE: The Colonel helped me work it out.
DANNY: I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
RAFE: I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
DANNY: Don't make this a joke, Rafe. You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
RAFE: Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny. It's time I made mine.
