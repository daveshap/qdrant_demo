BISHOP: I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis. It seems to be metabolizing. He should wake up soon.
RIPLEY: Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
RIPLEY: Which would mean lots of those parasites, right? One for each person...over a hundred at least.
BISHOP: Yes. That follows.
RIPLEY: But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
BISHOP: That is the question of the hour. We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
RIPLEY: You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
BISHOP: Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others. A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all. It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors. She is the center of their lives, quite literally the mother of their society.
RIPLEY: Could it be intelligent?
BISHOP: Hard to say. It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves. That's if she exists, of course.
