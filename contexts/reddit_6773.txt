Asking the recruiter about the second job?
So I'm working with a recruiter right now and he submitted me for two jobs.  I already had a phone interview for the first one and was supposed to have an onsite this week, but they have not gotten back to him to set up a time (the team is just being set up, so they're very busy).  Is it rude if I ask about the second job?  Or do recruiters prefer to focus on one job at a time for people?
