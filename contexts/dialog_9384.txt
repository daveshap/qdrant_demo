CLERK: Sir? This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
DUKE: Yes... It makes sense.
CLERK: I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
DUKE: He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
CLERK: What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
DUKE: You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
CLERK: Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
DUKE: Awake? What do you mean?
CLERK: Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
DUKE: Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
CLERK: But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
DUKE: Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
CLERK: There's no hurry! The race is over!
DUKE: Not for me.
CLERK: Let's have lunch!
DUKE: Righto!
