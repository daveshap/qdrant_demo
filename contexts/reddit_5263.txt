Told a co-worker I don’t believe them, can I get in trouble?
Today I had an employee in our production planning department explaining their situation with my employees, this particular production planner seems to have more issues than the rest of the facility. So when this co worker explained her scenario I said “everytime you bring these up I frankly don’t believe you, so I investigate this stuff and it takes me a lot of time to find out the answers which are typically not what you’re stating.”

My position is a logistics supervisor, I’m worried by saying I didn’t believe this person, I was being unethical and can be disciplined..
