Today they fired my 83yr old Grandma from work what can she do?
So would hopefully come across some legal or insightful advice on what a sad situation of 37 loyal years to a company only to get booted. (Illinois)

She worked for this company 37 yrs, never called off unless it was an emergency rare, always on time unless there was a valid problem which was less than 10, and today they gave her the boot.

The company claimed she fell asleep a month ago wrote her up but she did not sign it because she did not agree with it, and she supposedly fell asleep again on Friday, however no video/image/witness proof exists, **having this job provided the insurance she needs (blue cross bs and Medicare part a part b) , she enjoyed feeling needed, she enjoyed her coworkers,** brightened her sprits and for them to just boot her was malicious.

Apparently their insurance went up because of her age is what an insider mentioned to me, which if true seems to be a plan of action to get rid of her.

**The saddest part that broke my heart was, as she was let go they told her to leave and do not say goodbye to anyone as she left, treating her like she was a criminal of some sort, who does that!!!! If they did nothing wrong, I would at least after 37 yrs of loyalty let her say her goodbyes, how rude.**

Is there any possibility of something to do? The insider mentioned to go to the company for her and ask for the visual proof of what they claim happened, anything other, my mind is so wrapped up in comforting her I can't think.

Thank you in advance to those who can provide some help, if you can't please vote this up so it can get to the eyeballs of someone that can maybe.
