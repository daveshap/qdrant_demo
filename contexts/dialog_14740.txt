BLATTIS: C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
CITRINE: .. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
BLATTIS: Grateful for your candor, Sir.
CITRINE: Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
BLATTIS: Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
CITRINE: Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
BERLIN: Why did he ask if it was frozen?
CITRINE: That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
