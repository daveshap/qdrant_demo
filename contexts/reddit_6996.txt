Suspension/resignation advice
I was suspended on June 10th pending a disciplinary process. Well the process is complete and I'm invited on Monday 24th to a hearing where a decision will be made.   


They have some strong evidence in the form of statements from my colleagues - I am guilty of some of the things they've accused me of. I do not want to fight the accusations and my resignation decision is final.  


My questions are:  


1. Should I resign now, ie. before the disciplinary hearing or during the hearing?  
2. When I do resign will I get paid for the 1 week notice period (the money would be a huge bonus)?  
3. How can I ensure that they pay me for my unused annual leave? I have spoken to a former employee who went through a similar process and wasn't paid for 6 days unused leave.

I'm in the UK fyi.
