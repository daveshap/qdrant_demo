Fellowship only covers In-State Resident Tuition; is this the norm?
I have moved to a new state for a Ph.D program. I was accepted and awarded with a fellowship and a stipend of $24k(USD) per year. This sounded like a great opportunity but now it's time to pay the excess fees and I find out the fellowship only covers the amount for a state resident tuition. Since I've only lived in this state for a month, I'm expected to pay the $3k per semester difference for the non-resident tuition. 

This really surprised me because this detail didn't seem to be mentioned in the emails or in the actual fellowship acceptance letter, my undergrad professors never mentioned this as a downside to going out of state, and I can't find anything online about this being the norm. Is this normal and has anyone else experienced this? Is there any way to argue to have this covered or maybe get the resident rate (as I have moved to this new state, changed my address, and plan to get a state license with the intention of staying)?
