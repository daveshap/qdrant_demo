MRS. DREYFUSS: You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie? Sssh!
BUD: One napkin, coming up. I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
MRS. DREYFUSS: What did I tell you?
BUD: Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
MRS. DREYFUSS: You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll come back for them later. If he makes trouble, give me a yell.
FRAN: She doesn't seem to like you very much.
BUD: Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
FRAN: Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
BUD: Yes, I've got it. Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
FRAN: Open it.
BUD: There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
FRAN: That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
BUD: Sure.
