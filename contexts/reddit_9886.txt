Don't know how to choose a program
Hi everyone! I've found a ton of helpful information on this subreddit about what to consider when applying for a graduate program, so thank you! I have definite answers as to what kind of program I want, but I'm not always sure that's matching up with the schools I'm looking at. I would love some feedback or suggestions on what to add/remove from the list! Oh, and my ultimate goal is to work in a Career Center :)

About me:
-3.83 GPA
-Above average GRE scores
-2 years experience as an RA, 3 years volunteering in Career Center

Wants:
-For my grad school to be paid for by an assistantship, probably in Res Life (lol like every other grad student)
-East or West coast preferably
-Larger school
-Counseling focus, not administrative 

My current list of schools:
-Syracuse
-Cal State Sacramento
-Colorado State University
-SUNY Plattsburg
-Florida State University
-Mississippi State University
-Cal State Northridge (maybe)
-Virginia Commonwealth U (maybe... no idea how much their assistantship covers)

Any great ones I'm missing? Or ones I should take off? Thank you in advance!!
