SQL Server 2014 Edition Downgrade I have a SQL Server 2014 Standard Edition used by my devs to test their applications pointing to a common instance. Lately I've been informed that for this purpose I can use Developer Edition, that it would keep all the features they need to work.I've see on Microsoft website that this counts as an Edition Downgrade and won't have a proper \"Wizard\" to help on this task. Seeing this, I planned on:Backup all databases, export users, jobs and grants. Uninstall Standard Edition.Install Developer Edition.Restore databases and re-create users, give grants and re-create jobs.I did use DBA Tools Powershell Library to migrate a previous instance on the exact same case. Is this plan the easiest option to achieve this migration? Thanks in advance!
