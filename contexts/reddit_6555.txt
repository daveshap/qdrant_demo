Just started a new job, is this a red flag?
I’m an assistant property manager, it’s a small office, around 15 people. Everyone’s office is messy as hell, including the owners. Papers stacked a mile high, boxed/unopened food on the floors/tables stacked up. A ceiling tile is missing. It’s not dirty but very cluttered and messy. Is this a red flag for something bigger?
