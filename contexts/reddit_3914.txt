It seems these days the main indicator of being is a relationship with someone, is daily good morning/night texts.
I knew my first relationship was going well once the daily text began, and I knew it was ending once they started to falter. Every relationship after followed this pattern. Is this the same for everyone else too?


Note: I am not talking about  exchange volume of text messages as an indicator, just that when you find yourself consistently and daily, sending/receiving a good morning/night text, it may mean you have an established relationship.
