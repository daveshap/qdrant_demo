What weapons, that are distinctively not firearms, have been banned, or protected, under interpretations of the 2nd amendment?
Recently a [Federal judge struck down a 1974 New York law](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/nyregion/nunchuks-ban-overturned-new-york.html) that banned nunchucks. In that case, the judge's reasoning was at least partially dependent on the 2nd amendment. 

> “The centuries-old history of nunchaku being used as defensive weapons strongly suggests their possession, like the possession of firearms, is at the core of the Second Amendment,” Judge Chen wrote.

I associate, clearly wrongly, the 2nd amendment with firearms and only firearms. I am wondering how else the 2nd amendment has been applied to weapons that are distinct from firearms.
