Casually suicidal?
I would love for things to stop. Time to hold still and so slowly fade. Suicide will never be that peaceful.
I think abt death often. I don't necessarily have plans for life. I'm just patiently waiting for death. Like at a bus stop. I might read a book to pass time but my destination is so peaceful I can't help but to want to go there. 
I'm constantly afraid. Of everything. Feeling silence would be amazing

Point of this? Idk I never told anyone this cus they would worry but I feel like i need to. Don't worry tho~ most likely I won't be taking an active role. I've desired death even stronger than now and I've been too afraid. So.

Edit : thanks for the comments. Its nice knowing I'm not alone. If anyone would like advice since I'm just "waiting at my bus stop" doing what I can enjoy has been a great way to spend time. I'm in love with art. But hey if geeky stuff or insects is ur calling yo for it without shame. It's probably gonna be the thing keeping u alive
