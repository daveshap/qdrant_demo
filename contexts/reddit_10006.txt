Role of graduate students in student orgs?
Hi, first time poster!

I'm a first year graduate student (in urban planning) at a large public university, and I'm involved in a few student organizations to gain leadership experience I've felt like I didn't get in undergrad.

My question is, should I just act like a regular student and try to stay the course, or should I become a coadvisor and have (what I perceive to be) a more conventional role?
