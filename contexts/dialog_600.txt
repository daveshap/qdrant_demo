MARTHA: You lied to me
MOTHER MIRIAM: About what?
MARTHA: Your niece!
MOTHER MIRIAM: I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
MARTHA: No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
MARTHA: And Agnes' father?
