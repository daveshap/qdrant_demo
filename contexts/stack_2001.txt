The meaning of \"practice\" in the mentioned text? There is a special sense the word \"practice\" is used for that I have problem understanding. Following is the title of a book:<blockquote>  Food Sovereignty in International Context: Discourse, politics and  practice of place</blockquote>What is the meaning of \"practice\" in this title? For me, as far as I could search and find, \"practice\" when used as a noun can mean one of the following (American Heritage Dictionary):<blockquote>    A habitual or customary action or way of doing something: makes a practice of being punctual.  a. Repeated performance of an activity in order to learn or perfect a skill: Practice will make you a good musician. b. A session of  preparation or performance undertaken to acquire or polish a skill:  goes to piano practice weekly; scheduled a soccer practice for  Saturday. c. Archaic. The skill so learned or perfected. d. The  condition of being skilled through repeated exercise: out of practice.  The act or process of doing something; performance or action: a theory that is difficult to put into practice.  Exercise of an occupation or profession: the practice of law.  The business of a professional person: an obstetrician with her own practice.  A habitual or customary action or act. Often used in the plural: That company engages in questionable business practices. Facial  tattooing is a standard practice among certain peoples.  Law. The methods of procedure used in a court of law.  Archaic. a. The act of tricking or scheming, especially with malicious intent. b.
