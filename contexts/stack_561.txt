How can I stop Ubuntu Dock from extending to the edges? By default Ubuntu Dock in Ubuntu 17.10 and later releases always extends to the edges (top-bar-to-bottom if placed on the left or right and left-to-right when placed at the bottom) even when it's not filled with icons.Is there a way to prevent this behaviour (i.e. I want to make the dock-length flexible, as the number of application icons in the dock increases it should expand accordingly)?In other words, is there a way make Ubuntu Dock look like a \"proper dock\" instead of a side/bottom panel?
