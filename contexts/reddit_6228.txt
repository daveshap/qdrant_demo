Switching jobs -I have a trip booked for May. Asking for experiences with new employers for vacation before accrued time?
Hi! Not sure if I flagged the right flair. 

Like the title says, I am switching jobs and one of my top places I am waiting to hear back from has accrued vacation time. I won't have enough accrued vacation time by May - I will be taking a trip and will be gone 12 days (vacation and sister's graduation). 

Does anyone have experience with telling new employers that they will be gone for more days than they're accrued vacation? I'm willing to not get paid for part of the time but hope that I won't have to change my vacation time (booked with BF while at my current job).
