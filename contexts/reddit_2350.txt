ATTENTION: CORNELL NOW DOES NOT REQUIRE SAT SUBJECT TESTS (except for College of Engineering, where it is optional)
this was JUST CHANGED and is effective immediately for applicants of the Class of 2024! They do encourage sending test scores if you feel they will strengthen your application, but your application "will not be disadvantaged in the review process" (quoting from the email that was sent out). [Here is the link](https://admissions.cornell.edu/standardized-testing-requirements) to Cornell's website for further reassurance. Good luck with your applications everyone!
