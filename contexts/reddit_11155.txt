2 years of hard about to be meaningless due to going blind 3 years ago...
&#x200B;

Went blind three years ago -- nothing disease related, simply fell and hit my head in the wrong spot.

&#x200B;

Been typing software code since I was 8 years old and all of 3 feet tall, and damn good at it.  Spent the last 2+ years after going blind on a new open source PHP based software platform at [https://apex-platform.org/](https://apex-platform.org/).

&#x200B;

I'm sorry, but that code is solid.  Even the harshest critics on the internet I can find can't really say anything bad about it anymore.  I know software, and this is good code, and a good system.

&#x200B;

The one criticism I get though is the website looks like crap, and due to not being able to see the screen, I can't fix that myself.  Did previously manage to make and sepnd $1200 USD on a designer, but got screwed.  For the life of me I am unable to find work -- freelance, contract, short-term, long-term, nothing.  

&#x200B;

The only thing I really have to showcase potentials these days is Apex, but when the site looks like crap, it makes no difference as to how solid the code is, people will just click off within 10 seconds and move on with their day.  It's beyond frustrating to know that 2+ years of hard work, and a quality system that could actually help loads of people out there, may all go down the tubes as nothing due to some design flaws that I could easily fix myself in a few hours if I could see again.

&#x200B;

Without that though, I'm pretty much a sitting duck.  I can't find work, can't get anyone to actually take an interest in Apex, and the main obstacle seems to simply be the design.  Or at least the feedback I'm hearing from others.
