Ghosted after 5 months
I just need to vent and say that ghosting has to be one of the cruelest things one can do when dating these days. It really makes the other person feel totally insignificant and disrespected. Not to mention the agonizing that follows being ghosted, trying to figure out what possibly went wrong. 

I don’t understand why it’s so difficult to send a simple text saying it’s just not going to work out. Ghosting is a cowards way out and is very traumatizing to the person they do it to, especially if they were dating for months. It can completely kill ones self esteem and makes me not even want to put myself out there anymore.
