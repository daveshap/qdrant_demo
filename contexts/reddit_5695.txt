What are some good types of places to offer volunteering?
I am currently unemployed and finding the job search difficult. I feel like I need to meet more people, get out and put something on my resume too. However, I am not interested in those temporary 'gardening' volunteer roles or charity shops. I am looking for something a little more challenging and/or relevant to my industry which is IT. Many companies don't seem to want to take volunteers probably due to data protection reasons. However, would University labs, departments or professors take on a volunteer? What other places can I request volunteering at?
