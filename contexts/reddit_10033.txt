Academic Suspension
I was academically suspended for the spring semester today. I have a 1.7 GPA. My problem is that I need special documentation that explains my academic shortcomings and I have none. I simply *felt* depressed and didn't apply myself. 

My parents are very upset and I'm probably gonna have to work full time somewhere until the summer semester because I don't have any psychological or special circumstances. My asthma medication has a side of affect of depression but it's probably too late to get documentation of that being cause even if it is.

So, I'm not sure how I should approach my appeal letter...I really need help.

Thank you all for your time.
