ANTHONY: Where are you going?
DIGNAN: I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
ANTHONY: How was I ridiculing you?
DIGNAN: You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
ANTHONY: That's not what I meant, Dignan.
DIGNAN: Did you see that?
ANTHONY: Yeah, I saw it.
DIGNAN: I'm lookout.
ANTHONY: Dignan, it's got an alarm.
DIGNAN: I don't think so. Just reach on in.
ANTHONY: That sets it off.
DIGNAN: No, just do it real quick. I'll meet you down there.
ANTHONY: It had an alarm.
DIGNAN: Yeah, I heard that.
ANTHONY: Five, seven, eight dollars.
DIGNAN: Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
ANTHONY: Eight dollars.

BOB: Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
DIGNAN: How much could you grow? Realistically.
BOB: As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
DIGNAN: Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
BOB: You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
ANTHONY: In your backyard? How do you protect them?
BOB: It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
ANTHONY: Hector woudn't do anything.
BOB: But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
DIGNAN: If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
BOB: Good question.
BOB: Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
DIGNAN: You're paranoid, Bob.
BOB: Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
ANTHONY: Could you grow cinnamon?
BOB: I don't know. Sure, I guess.
ANTHONY: You could make your own cinnamon toast.
BOB: Are you a fag?
LITTLE RICHARD: You're the faggot.
