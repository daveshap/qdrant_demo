Does the US constitution allow for social democracy to be implemented on a federal level in the US, if yes/no then how/why?

Bernie Sanders’ support is [equivalent](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-starts-2020-in-strong-position-in-iowa-new-hampshire-cbs-news-battleground-tracker-poll/) to other front runners in the upcoming democratic primary elections. He is a [self proclaimed](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/12/18663217/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism-speech-transcript) “democratic socialist” although [some argue](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/03/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism/471630/) he’s rather a social democrat in a Scandinavian sense of the word.

“Social democracy is a political, social and economic philosophy that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal democratic polity and a capitalist-oriented economy” according to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy?wprov=sfti1) that in turn refers to Sargent, Lyman Tower (2009). Contemporary Political Ideologies: A Comparative Analysis (14th ed.). Wadsworth Publishing. p. 117.

Looking at the current United States constitution, is Bernie Sanders’ political ideas possible to implement on a federal level? Does the US constitution allow for federal interference on welfare, medical care, tax redistribution on an individual level and so on?
