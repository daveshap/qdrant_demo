Nancy Peolsi and Chuck Schumer are calling for Labor Secretary Acosta to resign over how he handled the Jeffery Epstein case when he was a Federal prosecutor in Florida. How is Acosta responsible for providing lenient punishment, and was punishment lax compared to others convicted of the same crime?
[Jeffery Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein) is a wealthy financier who in 2008 was convinced on a single state charge of "soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14." [Some sources cite two charges]

His 2008 deal signed by current Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta [included certain benefits](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article219494920.html):

> ...the multimillionaire was assigned to a private wing of the Palm Beach County stockade, where he was able to hire his own security detail. Even then, he didn’t spend much time in a cell. He was allowed to go to his downtown West Palm Beach office for work release, up to 12 hours a day, six days a week, records show. 

Additionally, the Miami Herald reports Acosta's non-prosecution agreement "essentially shut down" an ongoing FBI probe into linked crimes and victims, may have granted immunity to potential co-conspirators that were left unnamed, and that Acosta may also have violated Federal law when he [failed to notify](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html) victims of Epstein of this deal:

> Not only would Epstein serve just 13 months in the county jail, but the deal — called a non-prosecution agreement — essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein’s sex crimes, according to a Miami Herald examination of thousands of emails, court documents and FBI records.

> The pact required Epstein to plead guilty to two prostitution charges in state court. Epstein and four of his accomplices named in the agreement received immunity from all federal criminal charges. But even more unusual, the deal included wording that granted immunity to “any potential co-conspirators’’ who were also involved in Epstein’s crimes. These accomplices or participants were not identified in the agreement, leaving it open to interpretation whether it possibly referred to other influential people who were having sex with underage girls at Epstein’s various homes or on his plane.

> As part of the arrangement, Acosta agreed, despite a federal law to the contrary, that the deal would be kept from the victims. As a result, the non-prosecution agreement was sealed until after it was approved by the judge, thereby averting any chance that the girls — or anyone else — might show up in court and try to derail it.

There were [36 victims cited](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48925932) in court documents.

This 2008 deal by Acosta has come under scrutiny because of [new charges against Epstein](https://www.apnews.com/f995d90cbfd943169f74a0dbb3b1eadc). 

Acosta has defended the deal as appropriate (from Source 3):

> “At the end of the day, based on the evidence, professionals within a prosecutor’s office decided that a plea that guarantees someone goes to jail, that guarantees he register [as a sex offender] generally and guarantees other outcomes, is a good thing,’’ Acosta said of his decision to not prosecute Epstein federally.

I have a few questions on this topic:

1) What authority did Alexander Acosta have to make the punishment against Jeffery Epstein more severe? How much responsibility on deciding the sentencing rests with Acosta?

2) Was Jeffery Epstein's punishment on "soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14" in the state of Florida unusual? In terms of time served, fines, sex registration, and prison/jail treatment, what evidence is there that Epstein was given preferential treatment?

3) Several prosecutors have stated Acosta's deal was unusual in terms of how Epstein was treated, but also how it affected an FBI probe and granted immunity to potential co-conspirators. Is there anything else unusual about the non-prosecution agreement or Acosta's handling of the Epstein case overall?
