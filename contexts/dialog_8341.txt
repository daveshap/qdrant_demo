GIN: I always knew you'd do the job.
MAC: You've got everything planned.
GIN: Everything.
GIN: I'll need the Rembrandt now.
MAC: Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
GIN: I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
MAC: Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
GIN: Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
MAC: Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
