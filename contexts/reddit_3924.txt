Anyone else writing off 2020?
Let’s be honest: 2020’s been a very stressful year on a macro scale. It’s hard to believe half the year has gone by with lockdowns and pandemics and what not. I had really hoped to make this year a good one, after recognizing what some of my challenges were and having a plan to overcome them. 

I had realized some time ago that a lot of this year may well go by before any sense of normalcy or safety returned. More than that, I’m sort of accepting that this whole year may well be written off. I have tried Skyping and video calls with potential dates, but it just isn’t that easy to really progress anything until you meet in person. 

I say to other singles on this sub, it’s probably best to just accept that this year won’t likely bring substantial positive change to our dating lives. And honestly, that’s ok. It’s a difficult situation that most of us can’t do much about. I’m not saying I’m happy about it in the slightest, but I am saying that accepting it means that we can at least focus on other things. 

I don’t know that I’ll stop using online dating platforms, but I’m not expecting much at this point.

What are others thinking?
