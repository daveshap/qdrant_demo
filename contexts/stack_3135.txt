Combining light of the same linear polarisation Is there a way to combine two (coherent) beams that have the same polarisation and wavelength in a lossless manner such that the resultant beam has the same polarisation as the starting beams?I'm aware that it is possible to combine two orthogonally polarised beams using a reverse polarising beam splitter, but the resultant beam will have a different polarisation than both the incident beams which is undesirable. I also know that x:1-x beam splitters exist, but they would remove a large amount of the light coming in which is also undesirable.
