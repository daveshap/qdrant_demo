You Are a Trophy too Fellas
For any guy that needs to hear this whether they are having troubles in dating or life in general. Just know that you are a trophy that is to be won as well.

Often many men will put beautiful they see/meet on a pedestal and act completely different from who they actually are, which only pushes them away. You wouldn’t change the game plan that got you to the championship, would you? Be yourself and know that you yourself are enough to shoulder your own happiness. Girlfriends aren’t meant to be your happiness, they are there to enhance it. You need to wake up everyday, look in the mirror and have the mentality of “you know what? I’m a F****** catch and anybody would be lucky to have me”. 

Adopt the mindset that your life is a long car ride, many people will hop in and hop out of your car but guess what? No matter what you are always the driver, never let anybody take you out of the drivers seat to your glory. If people want to get in? Make sure they are worth it. If they want to get out? All the power to you, this train will keep on rolling. 

Both parties in dating are trophies that both need to win each other. Or I suppose if you’re an Incredibles fan, if everybody is a trophy, nobody is, which also should take the edge off.

Good day to you all!
