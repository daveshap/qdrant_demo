MACKELWAY: The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
JANITA: Yes.
MACKELWAY: What did he look like?
JANITA: I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
MACKELWAY: How did you know he was a construction worker?
JANITA: He had an orange hat on.
MACKELWAY: I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
DYLAN: That's right, Jan.
MACKELWAY: He was sitting here?
JANITA: It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
JANITA: There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
MACKELWAY: What kind?
JANITA: An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
MACKELWAY: Put a BOLO out on that.
