JOHN: Well, nothing.
GRACE: Now what?
JOHN: Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
GRACE: But you said we could be together.
JOHN: Are you kidding? I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
GRACE: What difference does it make? You killed Jake.
JOHN: <u>We</u> killed Jake. And it's a big difference. You kill an old man, that's one thing. Nobody cares about an old man. You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
GRACE: He was a crooked bastard. He would have killed us.
JOHN: The police don't know that. And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck. I'll take you as far as California. If we can even make that. After that I'm cutting you loose.
GRACE: But I want to say with you,
JOHN: Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again? You take your hald of the money and run. You might want to try Mexico. With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
GRACE: I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you. Don't you think I care about you?
JOHN: I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch. But it's nice to know you care.
