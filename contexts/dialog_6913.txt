MRS. FARREN: She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me â€” always!
AMY: Who is she?
MRS. FARREN: That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? </PRE><PRE> AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
MRS. FARREN: There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
AMY: No, thank you.
MRS. FARREN: One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
