COUNT: I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
RODERICK: Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
COUNT: Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
RODERICK: Very well! Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
COUNT: Then you yield to me.
RODERICK: On the instant. Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
COUNT: Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
RODERICK: That is a trifle strong.
COUNT: Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
