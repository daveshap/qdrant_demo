UNCLE AL: I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
MARTY: But Uncle Al! You said-
UNCLE AL: I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
JANE: The moon's not down yet...
UNCLE AL: Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
MARTY: What if I say no?
UNCLE AL: Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy. Go on, now.
