SALIERI: Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
LORL: I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
SALIERI: Why? What has happened?
LORL: You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
SALIERI: What medicine?
LORL: I don't know. He has pains.
SALIERI: Where?
LORL: Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
SALIERI: Is he working?
LORL: I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
SALIERI: Is he working?
LORL: I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
SALIERI: Opera? Opera!
LORL: Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
SALIERI: Are you sure it's an opera?
MOZART: I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
SALIERI: Are you neglecting my request?
MOZART: No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can!
MOZART: This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
CONSTANZE: Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
MOZART: Give me two more weeks. Please.
