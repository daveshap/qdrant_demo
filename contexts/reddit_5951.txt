Is a major in Computer Science or Informatics better for general job opportunities?
Hi all!

So I attend Indiana University, and here the two big majors in our School of Informatics and Computing are, obviously, Informatics and Computer Science. We don't have a super successful or established program, but we do pretty well and graduates from both majors typically end up in high-paying jobs. 

I'm currently an Informatics major, but I am thinking about switching to Computer Science. I've heard from lots of people both in the CS program and in the workforce that majoring in CS will ultimately give me more job opportunities. I feel like I'm learning more useful and tangible skills in my intro to programming class (a CS class that I'm taking for an Info credit), where we're learning Python. In contrast, what I'm learning in my Informatics classes is... relatively interesting, but not super helpful? It's pretty much just learning about how technology interacts with society, the ethics behind technology, etc. I love learning and researching these things, but truthfully while I'm here paying a bunch of money in college I'd like to learn more skills that I can take with me to the work force.

The jobs that I'm interested in mainly include software engineering/development, web development, UX/UI design, and similar jobs. Would a Computer Science degree help me in getting these jobs more than an Informatics degree would? I personally have a hard time explaining what Informatics is to people, but apparently it's great if you want to work in front-end stuff (which I might be interested in).

Sorry for the block of text! Any thoughts on which major might be best?
