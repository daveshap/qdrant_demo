U.S. ATTORNEY: I can't give you that. This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years. He's been getting it from every end. I'd love to hear his story.
COURT'S ATTORNEY: One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
U.S. ATTORNEY: One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
COURT'S ATTORNEY: I can accept that.
U.S. ATTORNEY: And I want to turn the home over to the state.
COURT'S ATTORNEY: He'd like to start serving immediately.
U.S. ATTORNEY: I can put that together.
COURT'S ATTORNEY: Confirm this with my office and my client.
U.S. ATTORNEY: I'll put this past my boss
COURT'S ATTORNEY: Alright.
LLOYD: She wouldn't get out of the car. I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car. But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
JIM: Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
LLOYD: That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
JIM: Are you?
LLOYD: Am I going? Am I going to England? I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right? What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy? There's no way.
JIM: Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride. You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
LLOYD: I know.
JIM: She's very successful.
LLOYD: I know
JIM: Very talented.
LLOYD: I know. But then I reconsidered. 'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter. I'm good at it.
JIM: You're not a permanent part of her life. You're a distraction.
LLOYD: I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir. Are you alright sir? Are you okay?
JIM: I'm incarcerated, Lloyd! I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this. I don't deserve to have you as my go-between. And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
