Can HR see me as being at fault for this?
Me and this other coworker started out the same time and we were doing fine at first. Then one day when we worked on a project together two things happened.  I wanted the project to be accurate so I discussed that we should research more into it before finalizing it. The other was that I said her word doc file was a spreadsheet and not a formula(in a no ill intend way). The next day I would try to talk to her and she would ignore me. Now she doesnt talk to me unless we are in front of our managers. Today during a meeting with our director, our director wanted everyone to take a employee inclusion workplace training(training to make sure u make other employees feel welcomed). I felt like he said that as a indirect way towards me and the other coworker. But like I feel like I didnt do anything wrong bc i tried talking to her and she would ignore me. She ignored me for 2 weeks now. Do you think HR would see me being at fault for this?
