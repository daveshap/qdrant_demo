Feeling naked and afraid.
I just cut up 3 credit cards. I'm a waitress and summers are hard so year after year I max out my cards in the summer then have to pay down in season. Vicious cycle. Today that ends!. Thanks for letting me share, I'm feeling a little shakey over this so I needed to vent and know I did the right thing. Now to set a plan of attack to pay these down, thats another day I guess.

Edit: Just want to thank everyone who took time to reply and give me advice. I needed all of it. I feel empowered now!
