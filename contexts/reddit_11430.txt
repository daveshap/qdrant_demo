No job, SO left me, no money and feeling hopeless.
Fired from my last job and been unemployed for almost a year, filled out over 500 applications, had a handful of interviews and still no job. Spouse took my kids and I'm alone. My funds have depleted, I have NO money. I'm staying with a friend temporarily. Disfunctional family that has had enough of me, my problems and I can't turn to them for help. I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm frustrated and desperate.

Thanks for listening.
