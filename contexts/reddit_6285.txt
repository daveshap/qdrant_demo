Job background check help
I recently was hired with a major airline and I have to do the background check. Well a year ago I got pulled over on my dirtbike for not having a endorsement and was given a ticket, and went to the courthouse and was required to pay a fine which I did. Well the company is looking more into it, and the way the background check came back it looks pretty bad like I don't have a driver licence or I was suspended in general. I mean it was literally was just a fine that I paid and I do currently have a motorcycle endorsement. Do you think this will ruin my employment I'm very worried and scared to lose a job over something every minor a year ago. They requested I sent a dmv report with my license status which I did do as well as sent my driver license in general. Do you think this will ruin my chances?
