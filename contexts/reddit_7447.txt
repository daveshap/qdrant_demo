Any tips for taking notes on multiple articles for a paper?
I’m writing a paper for a class and I have about 20 articles printed out that I need to go through. Does anyone have any tips on how to best gather information? Do you take notes on a separate paper? Highlight the article? Go through the articles as you write the paper? 

I’ve never been great at studying or taking notes. I thought maybe this time I’d try to be a little more organized.
