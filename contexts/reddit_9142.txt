**\*\*edit: when applying, please read the google doc I have linked below. I've had many people message me who have been rejected, because they didn't follow some simple guidelines that are laid out there\*\***

Hi everyone,

I know this virus situation has put many of us out of work, especially as restaurants around the USA are closing. If you're looking for a new job or to supplement your income during this time, I really encourage you to check out Palfish. I've taught on there for about three years and logged 1000+ hours of teaching.

**You need to be a native English speaker, but you don't need a bachelor's degree, unlike all other high-paying teaching platforms. You don't need to speak Chinese, either.**

Mostly, it's playing interactive English games with the kids while correcting their pronunciation. You're provided the lesson materials, so there's no prep work. You need stable internet and a phone/tablet. You set your own schedule for classes. It’s a real job, so yes, you will have to go through an application process, which typically takes a few days.

Here is a google doc I made with a lot more in-depth info and some overview of what the classroom/lessons look like, if you'd like to read in more detail.

**Quick-start guide:**  [https://teachpalfish.weebly.com/](https://teachpalfish.weebly.com/) 

**If you do plan on doing Palfish, please read the guide carefully so that you pass your interview.**

You can download the app here - I'll get a notification on my Palfish account and I will walk you through the process. (I get a bonus if you join using my link, full disclosure!). Just figured I'd make a post here for those who are affected by this very unfortunate virus outbreak. (By the way, if there's some kind of pop up, it's probably due to it being a Chinese web page. It's safe.)

If you’d rather not enter your phone number, you can go to this [non-ref link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/palfish-teacher-english-tutor/id1020664979) and enter the code **4trMI6** at registration so that I’ll be able to see your profile and help you pass the interview.

I hope you found this post and the quick-start guide helpful, I wish you all safety and health during this time. God bless.
