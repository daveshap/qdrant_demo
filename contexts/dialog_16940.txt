CREASY: Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
PINTA: Dyslexic?
CREASY: Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament
PINTA: You got that right.
CREASY: You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
