Overwhelmed Package handler
As the title says. I work at FedEx. Today was my first day and I’m already overwhelmed. Out of all the candidates they put me with the worst driver. His truck is “special” and isn’t to be loaded like the rest. He has a perplexing system for his truck. He also was very boorish to me. I already feel like and idiot and don’t know if I can stick with this. Any advice. Thanks
