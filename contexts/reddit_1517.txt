Going to watch a movie at the cinema. Wish me luck
I kinda stopped going because I was so damn anxious I couldn't focus on the movie, but I'm going to try again today. Hope it goes well


Edit: I fucking did it! I was very stressed and near an attack when I was buying the ticket but as soon as I sat down and the film started I calmed down and enjoyed the entire 3h movie. If I did it, everyone can! You have to push yourself but you'll be happy once you do it
