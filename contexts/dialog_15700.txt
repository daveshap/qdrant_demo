DR. LECTER: I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
CLARICE: Then please - do this test for me.
DR. LECTER: No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
CLARICE: What's that, Dr. Lecter?
DR. LECTER: Advancement, of course. Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go. I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?
ARDELIA: Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
CLARICE: Thanks, Ardelia.
ARDELIA: You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
CLARICE: Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
