SQL Server Backups in Parallel Currently I am using ola hallengren  backup and maintenance scripts.I have a question:I have 5 big databases in one server. It's taking approximate 10+ hours everyday to complete full backups. Currently it's writing in sequentially into disk. I want to write all backups parallel to reduce time. Is there any way I can write backups parallel?I am taking compressed and verify only backups to network location
