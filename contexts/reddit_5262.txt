How do you get through a long shift at the most boring job?
Without getting high. They really stressed this point during training.

I work at a call center and I'm about to go in for my longest shift; 8 hours. I can't bring anything except water or do anything on the computer. I only get a call about every fifteen minutes and I've been told sundays are even slower. My last shift, which was 6 hours, I counted the seconds to see if my pace matched the computer's. Help me.
