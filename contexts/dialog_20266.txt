PETER: Hi.
FAITH: Hi. Are you... busy?
PETER: No. Are you're leaving?
FAITH: No. I just came by to apologize.
FAITH: It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy. Like I was on drugs or something.
PETER: I know the feeling.
FAITH: Yeah... Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
PETER: You aren't?
FAITH: No. I mean yes, I'm not. I decided to call it off. Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
PETER: Well. Congratulations.
FAITH: Thank you. So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime. I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
PETER: Are you asking me out?
FAITH: Yes. I am.
PETER: In that case... no...
