SATCH: Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
FRANK: He's not gonna stop, Satch. He's gonna keep on...
SATCH: Are you listening to me? You're in a world of shit. An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment. We got your prints all over the place. Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank. You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
FRANK: What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
SATCH: How's that?
FRANK: What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0. And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
SATCH: Frank, please...
FRANK: The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
SATCH: Frank, this is insane...
FRANK: In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run. Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th. The Mets are gonna win 5-3. Go watch the game, Satch.
SATCH: Go watch the game? Go watch the fucking game? Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer. It matches the Nightingale's profile. You understand what that means?
