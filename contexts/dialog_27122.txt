ED: Sure... Sure, it's his house.
BIRDY: That's what he keeps telling me.
ED: Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
BIRDY: Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
ED: That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
BIRDY: Boy.
ED: You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
BIRDY: Oh, Mr Crane--
ED: I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
BIRDY: Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
ED: I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
BIRDY: Geez, Mr Crane.
ED: Just see him, as a favor to me.
CARCANOGUES: ...You are ze fahzer?
ED: No. Uh... family friend.
