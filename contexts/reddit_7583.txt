Looking for a productivity/accountability buddy
I’m not technically in grad school right now, however I’m working on some academic work involving wrapping up an undergrad senior thesis project and applying for a grant to do an gap year project which would be essentially my dream come true. 

In order to achieve these things I have to work really hard over the next several months in a fully self motivated way (which I’ve always struggled with!). 

However, currently the potential reward is so high that I absolutely have to do my best to achieve it! 

So I’m looking for someone to act as a productivity/accountability buddy with me. There was one time someone here tried to organize a group for this but it fizzled out. Anybody interested or know where I might look? 

Probably just looking to correspond on a weekly basis with someone to see if each of us met our goals. 

Thanks!
