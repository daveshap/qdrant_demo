BARNARD: Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
CHANG: She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well. Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
BARNARD: Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
CHANG: Thank you.
CONWAY: And the wine - excellent.
CHANG: I'm glad you like it. It's made right here in the valley.
LOVETT: Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
GEORGE: The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
