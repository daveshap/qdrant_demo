It happened again
Met a girl on tinder, i usually get their snapchat before i meet to verify who they are but i skipped it this time because i asked her if she wanted to come over on my 5th message and she was down, needless to say she looked nothing like her photos. It was the same person but they looked nothing alike, fuck anybody that pulls this shit, this is the third fucking time. I was pretty nice to the first two but this time i just opened the door and saw i was fucking bamboozled so i closed it.
