Idk whats wrong with me
So I made this account because I have no one to talk to about it. But recently ive been having so many mental breakdowns and anxiety attacks. Nothing is wrong and I'm living a decent life. I know its probably because I'm a teen going through puberty and stuff but I dont see ppl with this problem. My problem is that I dont want to leave my house. All my friends ask me all yhe time to hang out or go somewhere, but I make up excuses or say that i dont wanna go. I just feel really anxious and sad whenever i leave the house and I dont know why. My friends are all upset because i never want to hang with them. Idk why I feel likw this. And I also always want to see my mom. I follow her around all day because whenever i dont see her I get sad. I cried the other night because I felt like shit to my friends and because i was feeling this way. Idk wht im lile this but its been going on for a while. Im afraid that it will further affect my life and relationships with ppl. Help
