RENTON: Good luck, Spud.
SPUD: Cheers.
RENTON: Now remember --
SPUD: Yeah.
RENTON: If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
SPUD: Right.
RENTON: But try too hard --
SPUD: And you might get the fucking job.
RENTON: Exactly.
SPUD: Nightmare.
RENTON: It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
SPUD: My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
RENTON: Try this.
