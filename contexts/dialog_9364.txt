THE RAT: The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
DAMONE: Whatever you say, Rat.
THE RAT: And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
DAMONE: Sensitive -- what is that?
THE RAT: Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
DAMONE: So what makes you so sensitive?
THE RAT: Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
DAMONE: What do you read? What's the last book you read?
THE RAT: Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
DAMONE: Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
THE RAT: It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
