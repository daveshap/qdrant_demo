antonym for \"compressive\" The tidal field (of the Earth on the Moon, for example) is compressive in the two tangential directions, but stretching in the radial direction. I.e. it pulls at the Moon (towards Earth and in the opposite direction). What is more appropriate/suitable than stretching here?EDIT: an antonym for \"compression\" is \"expansion\but is \"expansive\" appropriate?
