BETH: How about the booze?
NICK: It's been three months.
BETH: How about the coke?
NICK: No.
BETH: No?
NICK: No! I'm working my tail off. I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
BETH: How's not smoking?
NICK: It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
BETH: Yes.
NICK: Thank you.
