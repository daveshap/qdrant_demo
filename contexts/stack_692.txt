Trouble installing ddccontrol I am running Kubuntu 14.04 on a 32-bit system and I'm trying to install ddccontrol so I can change my monitor brightness without touching the monitor in a GUI. I understand I need to install the CLI version first to get the GUI version (gddccontrol) as is my goal. I have found multiple packages on GitHub and Launchpad and have tried all that I can find. Most of the .deb packages I\u2019ve ran with package installer have an error of Cannot satisfy dependencies. When I try the instructions on GitHub along with other suggestions like sudo apt-get or apt install, I get the error \"E: unable to locate package\" and then the name of the package I'm trying to install. Recently I got an error of no installation candidate.
