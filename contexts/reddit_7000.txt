Fired from state job, will that affect future employment?
So a bit about what happened and where I worked, I was a Correctional Officer In NC, I was let go last week after an incident that happened in November, Basically I confiscated illegal drugs from an inmate and turned them into my Sergeant. The next day I was called into the office and asked why I didn't do the paperwork on it, all i could say at the time was I forgot about it. well anyways they report it to upper management and now months later they tell me they had me under investigation and that they were determining my termination tho they said it might not lead to that. fast forward a week later and im told that their decision was termination. Only thing I ever did was miss a few days but I had no write ups, i know i was at fault and there was no justifying my actions but I really hope this doesn't affect my search for a new job. I applied for a Telecomunicator position and im scared i might not be eligible...
