Did your child self think that your adult self would be completely confident and have it all figured out?
When I (f26) was in school I always imagined that by mid-20s I’d be completely comfortable in my own skin and wouldn’t give a shit about what other people thought. I just assumed that came with being an adult. Yet here I am, still feeling like I’m at the bottom of the food chain in social situations, and still just as anxious and doubtful of myself as I was 10 years ago.
It’s so weird. On paper I’ve achieved so many of the things I had hoped for myself... I should feel good about myself by now, or at least have enough evidence that I’m not a total piece of shit. 

Childhood me would be saying “how can you still not believe in yourself? How can you STILL be living so fearfully?” 
At this point I honestly don’t know what it will take to prove to myself that I am a perfectly capable human being. Anxiety wins every time.

EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your responses!!! I resonate with so many of you and it’s comforting to know I’m not alone in this!! I started CBT a few weeks ago and can’t say it’s been particularly helpful so far, but I plan to stick it out and hope for the best.
