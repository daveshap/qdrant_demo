Atmega naming scheme (324p vs 328p) I am looking into AVR chips (big fan) for a personal project. I need capabilities similar to Arduino Uno, so I recently compared Atmega 328p and Atmega 324p.To my surprise the 324p has significantly more features and on-board hardware than the 328p. To me, higher model number == more powerful/more features product, so discovering this slightly confusing me.Could anyone explain to me why Atmel chose such weird convention for naming their chips? I know this is not a big deal, but for the future reference I would like to know how to choose AVR MCU's for my needs properly (their buyers guide is not very helpful).edit: the 328p consumes twice less amount of power, so is it all down to smaller, less power hungry product?
