Only work about 3 actual hours per day (non salaried) and boss is non the wiser and thinks I do good work. Should I tell her the reality?
I work as a staff accountant for a credit union, and other than the month-end closing periods, I only do about 3 hours of actual dedicated work per day. 

This is not because I'm lazy, but because I have fine tuned/automated my processes to such a level that all of my work is completed by noon most days.

I am starting to get bored, and want more projects to work on. However, I don't want to do more work for the same pay. 

Im hoping that if I show my boss how much I get done in such a little amount of time, she will be impressed and request to increase my pay, while also giving me more stuff to do. 

Is this risky? Will I be shooting myself in the foot and get more work for no additional pay?. Any positives?

Thanks in advance.

Edit- Obligatory, Wow this blew up!. Thanks for your responses.

Some clarification, I'm not saying I won't do more work without a raise, moreso that I want to set an expectation that the value of doing extra work warrants a raise/promotion at the next review. My boss is very laid back and likes me as an employee, but in the end it's the CFO who approves/disapproves raises
