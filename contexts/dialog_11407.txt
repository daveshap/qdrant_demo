BEN: I wish you'd tell me.
MRS. ROBINSON: There's nothing to tell.
BEN: Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
BEN: Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
MRS. ROBINSON: Do you understand that?
BEN: Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
MRS. ROBINSON: Good.
BEN: I was just kidding around.
MRS. ROBINSON: Good.
BEN: But why shouldn't I?
MRS. ROBINSON: I have my reasons.
BEN: Then let's hear them.
MRS. ROBINSON: No.
BEN: Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
BEN: I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
MRS. ROBINSON: Let's drop it.
BEN: We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin?
BEN: I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes.
BEN: You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
MRS. ROBINSON: I wouldn't know.
BEN: Well, I'm not.
MRS. ROBINSON: You're not.
BEN: No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
MRS. ROBINSON: I see.
BEN: And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
BEN: Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
MRS. ROBINSON: Are you?
BEN: You're goddamn right I am.
