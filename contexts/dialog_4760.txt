KURTZMAN: Here. What do I do next?
SAM: Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
KURTZMAN: Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
SAM: Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
KURTZMAN: Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
SAM: Here.
SAM: That's it.
KURTZMAN: You are good to me Sam.
SAM: Don't mention it. See you later.
