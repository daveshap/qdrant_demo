Public trust security clearance
Hello all, I am nearing the end of my grad program and have recently accepted a job that is asking for a public trust security clearance. 

I’m wondering if anyone else has obtained one before and if they lied on their paper work related to their substance use History. I’m by no means a crazy party person but I’ve deff dabbled in some things in my undergraduate career. Was wondering if anyone has insight on this. For clarification I wouldn’t be a federal employee, I’d be working as an employee for private company X at a federal agency
