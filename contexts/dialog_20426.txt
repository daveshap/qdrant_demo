MAID: That's right, just me.
MAURICE: Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
MAID: I don't have any idea.
MAURICE: Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom. All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it. Look at the walls in the closets. The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.
