New job seems scheme-ish
Due to the difficulty of finding employment right now, I've been rapid-fire applying to jobs. I got an interview from one of my rapid-fire applications, and was subsequently offered a job; I gave them a tentative yes. 

The job seemed run-of-the-mill for my field, a step up from what I usually do, but nothing out of the ordinary. However, the interview set off some alarm bells.

The first thing that seemed off is that we would spend a couple hours every day doing development workshops with speakers from around the world. This seems like a massive waste of company resources to do this daily, and a waste of my time as I wouldn't be paid for this time. 

The other thing is that out of an 8 hour day, I'm only paid for 4 of those hours. The pay is okay enough to make up for it, but I'd be paid based on performance; which apparently means I could make anywhere from $600 to $1200 a week, which seems strange.

The last thing is just how unconventional the company seems; in the interview, I was told I would be making six-figures if I stuck around for a year or two (huh??) and the company has apparently grown from 1 to 20 offices in two years of existence.

There is also no information about the company anywhere on the internet, except for on their website which, to their credit, looks very legit and professional.

Sound familiar to anybody? Should I just bail?
