LANCE: Where you been?
BARRY: Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
BARRY: Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
LENA: You left me at the hospital.
BARRY: I'm sorry.
LENA: You can't do that.
BARRY: Ok.
BARRY: If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
LENA: So here we go.
