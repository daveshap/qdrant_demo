LEON: Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
MATHILDA: That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
LEON: Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
LEON: ...I prefer apartments... Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
MATHILDA: Friends? You're crazy! In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
LEON: You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
MATHILDA: A little...
LEON: Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
MATHILDA: Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
