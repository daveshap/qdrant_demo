Trying to recall a sci-fi book about elitists uploading their mind into computer to gain immortality I vaguely remember reading this book in which there was an elitist group trying to gain immortality by uploading themselves into a computer(simulation). Each created their own world. Our hero somehow ends up in some of these worlds. Most are against him - but one of the elitists (I think with an exotic 'Hawaiian' ring to his name) modelled a nature-world (or jungle... insects) and tried to help the hero.Tried googling, but \"fiction\" combined with \"upload mind\" or \"virtual reality\" gives too broad results.
