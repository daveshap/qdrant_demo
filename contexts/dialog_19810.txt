NIXON: Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry. When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react? Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
KISSINGER: They will understand, sir. To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions. History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
NIXON: That depends who writes the history books. I'm not a quitter ... but I'm not stupid either ... A trial would kill me -- that's what they want. But they won't get it.
KISSINGER: If they harass you, I, too, will resign. And I will tell the world why.
NIXON: Don't be stupid. The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways. You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
KISSINGER: You have many friends ... and admirers ...
NIXON: Do you ever pray? You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
KISSINGER: Uh ... not really. You mean on my knees?
NIXON: Yes. My mother used to pray ... a lot. It's been a long time since I really prayed. Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
NIXON: ... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
KISSINGER: Not at all. This is not going to leak, is it?
NIXON: Don't be too proud; never be too proud to go on your knees before God.
