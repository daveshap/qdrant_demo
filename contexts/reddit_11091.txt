How to get a boyfriend, from a guy
1. Laugh at our jokes but only if they are funny. We use humor as a defense mechanism (edited from commenter advice)

2. Compliment us. We don't get those often.

3. If he asks you to go somewhere don't make him wait three days and still not give him a clear answer (might be happening to me but whatever)

4. Just say that you like us. We probably like you back

Edit (adding good ones from the comments):

5. Three H's. Hugs, high fives, and hand shakes.

6. Vent to us. We will feel like we matter.

I don't know if this works for gay guys

I found the girl version. Here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/fbpcgo/how_to_get_a_girl_to_like_you_by_actual_girl/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
