Guy I'm dating always asks for selfies
I'm (24, F) dating a guy(29, M) I met on Bumble. We have fun together, we've only been on two dates so far but we have more planned. He's said he likes me and wants to keep dating and we stay in contact. I like him but one thing he does regularly is ask for a selfie. The first time he asked I was going to class so I scurried and sent him one. The second time he asked today I had no makeup on, was not trying in terms of looks. I sent him one and both time he'll reply with heart eyes or a kissy face. I don't know why but I hate that kind of attention. I don't think I have a gorgeous face or anything, it's just a face and if i were asked I'd almost objectively say I lean more towards unattractive. I'm just a human living life and doing her thing. The idea of sending someone selfies is so bizarre to me. I have never asked anyone to "send me a selfie". Is this normal behavior? For anyone who does this with their S.O or person they're dating  can you explain this to me?
