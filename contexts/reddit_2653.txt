How did you guys decide what you want to be in life? A few days ago was my 22nd birthday and it was a reminder that I still don't know what I want as a career.
After high school I studied civil engineering for two years and got a technical diploma, but since I was struggling during those two years with my personal life which of course had an impact on my learning, I could not continue in that domain. I switched to english literature for one year but I did not like the quality of teaching in my home country which made me apply abroad. Fast forward two years later, I'm in my second undergrad year of Psychology and Media and communication and I have absolutely no idea what I can do with them or even if they're useful and could grant me a good income.
