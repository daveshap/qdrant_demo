Dealing with job offers.
Hello everyone I just got accepted for my first big boy job. Now that this offer is on the table I am "valuable" since my current employer who didn't want to promote me now wants to counter the other parties offer. However, I have a second potential job that I've been waiting to hear back from for a while now. Whenever I message the recruiter all they say is that they will get back to me when they have an offer... The hiring manager told me that he'd have an offer about three weeks ago... My question is, should I let them know that I have an offer on the table? Would this be a smart thing to do?
