I am having a very hard time this week with my anxiety because I feel inundated by the news related to Kavanaugh/Ford allegations. 

In May of 1986, I, too, was gang raped at a high school party by boys that I knew, while I was intoxicated.  I am not going to share the details of the attack,  I am willing to say that I was hospitalized afterwards with significant injuries and I was unable to attend  my high school graduation because I was in the hospital.  Although I am pretty sure that my parents knew my injuries weren’t from “falling down in the woods” and the medical practitioners that examined me were very much aware that I didn’t just fall down.. no one addressed the true nature or extent of it.. even me.

I never talked about it. I never wanted to. I never wanted “justice.”  I wanted to make it go away because for a long, long time I felt like it was my fault. 

After 32 years.. it’s right there.. all over again.

I want to scream at every Facebook poster that has something obnoxious to say about Ford not coming forward.  I want to punch everyone who says “well, she was drunk” or “Boys will be boys.”  I want to vomit every time someone says “why did she wait so long?” and worse.. “he didn’t do anything..he just didn’t help her.” 

I feel like this happened to me last week, not over 30 years ago.  It doesn’t seem fair after successfully tucking it away for so long  it has resurfaced. 

I can see their faces in my dreams again. Even the ones who laughed at my torn bloody clothing and didn’t to anything to help, 

Edit: I adore all of you!! I focused on all of your support and wonderful well wishes.. not on the news!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
