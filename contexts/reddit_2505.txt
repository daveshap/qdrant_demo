"Jack of all trades" of Reddit, how did you settle on a career?
The curse about being halfway decent at nearly everything you try.... What do you commit to?

I am three years into a career and realizing this job will never pay what I am searching for (and capable of). 

Trying to reconsider career options but being mid twenties, married, and a parent limits my ability to return to education and commit to a complete change. On top of that, the subjects that interest me are broad, and I could see myself succeeding at nearly all of them... No idea where to go from here.
