SAM: That's not your line.
KELLY: Say you love me.
SAM: I love you. Now give me the line.
KELLY: No little girl can ever make me come.
SUZIE: Seems to like some of the same places you do. Funny you never met.
SAM: Yeah, real funny. You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
SUZIE: Trust me, the guy's dirty. He'll like it. Especially the part about offing me. Now get out of here. Go make yourself a new friend.
