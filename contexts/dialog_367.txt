MAX: Big date tonight?
WELLES: Yeah... guess so.
MAX: Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
WELLES: Pardon me?
MAX: My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
WELLES: Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
MAX: It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
WELLES: I'll risk it.
