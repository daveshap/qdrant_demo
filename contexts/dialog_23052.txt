SIDNEY: I have no idea.
MAN: Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
SIDNEY: Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
MAN: Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
SIDNEY: I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
MAN: What's your favorite scary movie?
SIDNEY: Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
MAN: And why is that?
SIDNEY: Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
MAN: Are you alone in the house?
SIDNEY: That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
MAN: Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
SIDNEY: So who are you?
MAN: The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
SIDNEY: So where are you?
MAN: Your front porch.
SIDNEY: Why would you call me from my front porch?
MAN: That's the original part.
