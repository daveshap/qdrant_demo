CAVANAUGH: Yes.
MCCLEOD: What worries you?
CAVANAUGH: You.
CAVANAUGH: You've been seeing her for over a month now. Have you learned nothing from the past?
MCCLEOD: I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
CAVANAUGH: So, you do this for yourself? What about her? You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod. You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen. You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
CAVANAUGH: That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart. Would you live that pain again?
MCCLEOD: No. What am I to do?
CAVANAUGH: The only thing you can do. You must end it.
