ELI: Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws â€“
RACHEL: We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
ELI: Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
RACHEL: I know God help me, I know that, Eli. But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
