GLENN: I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me. I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
KAREN: Glenn?
KAREN: You don't remember me, do you?
GLENN: It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking. I was never out there.
KAREN: No, that's not what I'm thinking.
GLENN: But you're sure we've met, huh?
KAREN: Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice. You're Glenn Michaels. I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
