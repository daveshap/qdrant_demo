On dating apps, ask the women (or men) out as soon as you can, a few days texting is more than enough
So I read it a lot here, that people don't know how to keep a meaningful conversation, how to get to know someone via texting, how to keep someone's attention, etc.

As a woman, what I liked the most when I was using dating apps if we met up immediately. I don't know either the answers for the above questions, I'm not a good texter. But if someone asked me out for a drink or a coffee, I went for it. If it was a 1 hour of coffee date, but it didn't work out, we didn't match in real life, it was one hour of our life. But if it was a good date, that it could last from 5 pm to 3 am, we were happy and we kept dating. But I can not imagine texting with someone for weeks/months before meeting in real life, only to turn out you don't actually like each other in person. I had a guy texting me everyday for like a month, but he never asked me out. I tried to text him as much as I could, but I'm not good in opening up to someone who I didn't even met. And one day, he ghosted me. Seriously, what was it good for? We put one month of effort in it for nothing. Just ask me out, and see if we like each other in person.

And this advice is not just for men, with half of my dates I suggested going out after a few texts.
