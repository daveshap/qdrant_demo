ANTONIO: How goes it?
RAMÓN: It never ends.
RAMÓN: Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff! I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us. It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
ANTONIO: Yeah.
ANTONIO: It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
RAMÓN: The woman question?
ANTONIO: Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
RAMÓN: So? What does he want to do about 'em?
ANTONIO: He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
RAMÓN: What do you mean -- sex equality?
ANTONIO: You know ... What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
