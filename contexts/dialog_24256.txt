LINDA: Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
VAUGHAN: Can I help you, sir?
FRANK: Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
LINDA: Nice to meet you, Karl.
