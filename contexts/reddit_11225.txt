I have a 13 year old son.

He’s the son i had with a girl when I was 15 and she was 19. 

I never loved her because I always felt like she was trying to trap me. And she stopped taking birth control on purpose. 

I proceeded to be away from my son for 8 out of his 11 years of life because of a program when I was 17 and prison when I was 20. 

When I got out me and my son both tried to build something but it wasn’t there and we grew apart. It makes me sad but at the same time I know he has everything he needs support wise. And financial wise I do everything I can. I also still am close with his family and his mom. 

Me and him just don’t click but in a way I’m ok with it because I know he doesn’t want for anything and if he needs me I’m here. 

Is that ok? I’m trying my best.
