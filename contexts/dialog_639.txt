MILLIE: Hello.
JOHN: Hello.
MILLIE: Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
JOHN: No, not me.
MILLIE: Oh you are, I know you are.
JOHN: No, I'm not.
MILLIE: You are.
JOHN: I'm not, no.
MILLIE: Well, you look like him.
JOHN: Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
MILLIE: Oh you do, look.
JOHN: My eyes are lighter.
MILLIE: Oh yes.
JOHN: And my nose...
MILLIE: Well, yes your nose is. Very.
JOHN: Is it?
MILLIE: I would have said so.
JOHN: Aye, but you know him well.
MILLIE: No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
JOHN: That's what you tell me.
MILLIE: What have you heard?
JOHN: It's all over the place, everyone knows.
MILLIE: Is it? Is it really?
JOHN: Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
MILLIE: I knew I could rely on you.
JOHN: Thanks.
