JOE: Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
FRANK: Sure. As long as she don't mind.
JOE: There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
JOE: He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
FRANK: That's what some folks say.
JOE: There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow. You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?
