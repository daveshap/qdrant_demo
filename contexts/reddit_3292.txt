Is it cool to apply to a job I don't want, but definitely could do just for the interview practice?
It's been a while since I had an interview because I haven't needed one, but I'm looking at getting back into construction in a white hat role, rather than a tradesman.  A window place wants someone who has "sales or construction experience", but I'm pretty over qualified.
