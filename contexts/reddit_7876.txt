What is the meaning of "rescue"?
Hi! Sometimes in presentations, I can hear of the term "rescue" in the sense of knock-out gene modification. Is that like for a gene, the double knock out homozygous will die, but then if I use a vector to transport a copy of that gene into the cell, the cell survives. In this case, can I say like the vector rescued the cell? If this is wrong, could someone tell me the meaning of "rescue"? Thanks!
