It’s that time again.
Just in case nobody has told you in a while, unclench your teeth.  Relax your shoulders.  Take some deep breaths through your nose, hold them for a few seconds, and release them.  Now, just breath until you’re able to sink in to your bed or your seat with your eyes closed. Whatever is stressing you can wait for a few minutes.  You deserve peace.
