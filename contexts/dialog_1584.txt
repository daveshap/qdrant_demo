ALVY: I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, Jew.""
ROB: You're crazy!
ALVY: No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, Jew.""
ROB: Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
ALVY: Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said
ROB: Ah, Max, you, uh...
ALVY: Stop calling me Max.
ROB: Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
ALVY: No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, Yes
ROB: Right, Max. California, Max.
ALVY: Ah.
ROB: Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
ALVY: Forget it, Max.
ROB: We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
ALVY: No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
ROB: Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
ALVY: I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
