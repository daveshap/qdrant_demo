NYAH: I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace. Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
ETHAN: At least you walked.
NYAH: If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
ETHAN: Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
NYAH: May I say something, no offence? You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
ETHAN: Working under adverse conditions. Highly adverse conditions.
NYAH: Sounds smashing. I'm in. Muchacho, mi carro, por favor! Now be serious. You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
ETHAN: You didn't do that badly.
NYAH: You're apologizing for me? Quite the gentleman..
ETHAN: Not really. I triggered the alarm..
