I've just moved to America, I want to move back
I'm 17 and just moved to California a little over a year ago with my family against my will. I'm originally from Australia and I absolutely loved my life there. I'm 18 in a few months but definitely not able to completely financially support myself, if I make the move back home my parents will cut me out of their lives. Everytime I try and explain how I'm feeling the only answer I get is "you're just not trying hard enough." Maybe they're right but I don't want to start a life here. It's been difficult making connections as I am not in school, instead moved straight on to my BA so it makes it difficult to meet people my own age. I'm just not sure what to try anymore
