My friend just shot himself in the head and we are left with nothing but questions and misery
There’s really nothing to say.  He had a beautiful five year old child and parents who cared about him and friends who are now very fucking pissed off.  This is bullshit.  I’m sitting here on reddit because there is nothing to do or say.  He was a great friend and the only person who didn’t criticize me or call me a coward for attempting suicide.  He would always say “me too bro.  It hurts every day”.  And now he’s gone.  Fuck you.
