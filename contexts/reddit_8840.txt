Is the US in the process a political realignment?
Populist movements on both the left and the right in the US, as evidenced by the [Trump and Sanders campaigns](http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/bernie-sanders-and-donald-trump-ride-the-populist-wave), could be a sign that 2016 will be a [realigning election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realigning_election). What evidence supports that idea? What steps are the parties taking, or should they take, in [anticipation of upcoming demographic shifts](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/16/this-year-millennials-will-overtake-baby-boomers/)?
