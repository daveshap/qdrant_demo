CRUZ: Gin? Where the hell are you?
GIN: I'm in the middle.
CRUZ: In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
GIN: He's on to something bigger.
CRUZ: Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
GIN: Too late now.
CRUZ: Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
GIN: I'm going to get him, I promise you.
