I'm holding on to hope
Recently out of a relationship that, to me, was magic.  I was older, she's in grad school, it was an LDR.  We were engaged.  She broke it off because she was confused and conflicted.  Didn't want to be a step mom or really a wife.  Wanted to live a little first.

Had she said, "I don't love you any more" or "I'm seeing someone else" I'd have been devastated, and I'd have moved on.

But, she said, "I don't know what the future holds."  And "I just need to be on my own for a while."  And "In a few years, who knows?"

Now, I know, as a grown person with a lot of relationships under my belt, that these are all nice ways of saying she doesn't want to be with me any more, and she wants to be with someone else.  My problem is, I can't let go of the hope.

This isn't a matter of forgetting her, or not loving her any more.  And I haven't talked to her in weeks.  But I've had worse relationships before and I've had a hard time letting go.  She was the best thing that's ever happened to me, I celebrated that every day, openly told her, shouted from rooftops.  I'd planned to quit my job, leave my kids with their mom (joint custody) and move to be with her.  I'd have given up everything.

So now I'm insanely holding onto the hope of maybe.  I'm holding onto "who knows?"  I'm 40 now, how long do I wait?  How long can I wait?  To me it's worth waiting, but I don't know if I'll be able to.  I can fill the time while I'm waiting, but when do I stop?

Knowing how relationships end, and what you're supposed to do is one thing.  But how do you deal with removing that hope?  Has anyone else ever hoped and waited and won out?  My head is tearing itself apart trying to decide.
