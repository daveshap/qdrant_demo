Anyone else with intense social anxiety and always feel like you're being judged 24/7?
I mean, I know of course others have that happen to them, but I'm really looking for people who can relate. I hate when I do a thing, anything, and it ends up 'wrong' and bad and other people witnessed it. I want to cry, I can't breathe, my chest hurts, I'm light-headed and can't stand, and I mostly can't stand that other people exist and see me. I hate feeling judged when I'm in public 24/7 and can never relax because of others. I'm so hyper-aware of others, I can't ever be myself, I'm not in control of myself or my actions at all. If anyone can relate, please :(
