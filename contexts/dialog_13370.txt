EDDIE: Long wait for a bus?
SARAH: Yes.
EDDIE: How long you been waiting?
SARAH: What?
EDDIE: How long have you been waiting?
SARAH: Since four.
EDDIE: Just a cup of black coffee, please... Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute! Would you, uh, like another cup?
SARAH: Fine, thanks.
EDDIE: What time does the bus leave?
SARAH: What bus?
EDDIE: Yours.
SARAH: Eight o'clock.
SARAH: That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
EDDIE: Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
