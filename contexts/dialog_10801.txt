DANA: Hello, Peter.
VENKMAN: You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first. I'm still into all this stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen my show?
DANA: I have. That's why I didn't call you first.
VENKMAN: I can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, I'm going to give it my best shot. Let's go to work, boys.
VENKMAN: So what happened to Mr. Right? I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
DANA: He didn't ditch" me. We had some problems
VENKMAN: He ditched you. You should've married me, you know.
DANA: You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
VENKMAN: Men are very sensitive, you know. We need to feel loved and desired, too.
DANA: Well, when you started introducing me as the old ball and chain
VENKMAN: I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
