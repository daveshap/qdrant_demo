MERRILL: They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky. They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
GRAHAM: The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
MERRILL: Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
