DOMINO: Everything. It is a ghastly existence.
SOPHIE: Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
DOMINO: The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
SOPHIE: Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
DOMINO: I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband. Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
SOPHIE: Must you use that awful word?
DOMINO: Cunt.
SOPHIE: Stop it.
DOMINO: Cunt.
SOPHIE: I said stop it.
DOMINO: Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?
