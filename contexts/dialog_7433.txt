SCRATCH: It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster.
WEBSTER: Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
SCRATCH: With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
WEBSTER: I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
SCRATCH: I'll be there, too!
WEBSTER: Say, that's pretty good, young man.
SCRATCH: Pretty good -- that's perfect!
JABEZ: Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
WEBSTER: Ten throws it is.
WEBSTER: You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
JABEZ: Thank you, Mr. Webster.
WEBSTER: I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
JABEZ: Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
WEBSTER: Not at all, lad -- not at all. For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
