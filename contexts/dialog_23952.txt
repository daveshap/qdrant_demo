UNCLE AL: You all right, Marty?
MARTY: Yeah.
UNCLE AL: There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
MARTY: No.
UNCLE AL: Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
MARTY: Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
UNCLE AL: Huh?
MARTY: What if it's some kind of monster?
MARTY: What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
UNCLE AL: A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
