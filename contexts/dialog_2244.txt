AUSTIN: You're smashed, Vanessa.
VANESSA: I am not.
AUSTIN: Oh, yes you are.
VANESSA: I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
AUSTIN: I can't. You're drunk.
VANESSA: It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about. What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
AUSTIN: She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
AUSTIN: Right away, Exposition.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Where is Vanessa, by the way?
AUSTIN: She's working on another lead right now.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
AUSTIN: Thank you, Basil.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Oh, and Austin...
AUSTIN: Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION: Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
AUSTIN: Oh, yes. Thank you.
BASIL EXPOSITION: There's one more thing, Austin.
AUSTIN: Yes?
BASIL EXPOSITION: Be careful.
AUSTIN: Thank you.
