FRANCES: Harry? Harry, where are you?!
HARRY: Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
FRANCES: I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
HARRY: Calm down, Frances.
FRANCES: Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
FRANCES: Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
HARRY: Frances...
FRANCES: Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
