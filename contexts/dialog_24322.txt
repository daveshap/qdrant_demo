RASHID: I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
CYRUS: An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it? I'll tell you what happened to my arm. I'll tell you what happened. Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, Cyrus
RASHID: And have you mended them?
CYRUS: I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature. I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known. And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior. So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
RASHID: You named the kid after yourself, huh?
CYRUS: That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
