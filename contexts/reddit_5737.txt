Got fired during probation. Leave it off the CV?
I got fired during my 6 months probation period and I worked for only 4 months in a pretty well known organisation. The reasoning behind me getting fired according to them is I am not a good fit for the company (don't know what that means and why they didn't figure this out during my interview). I relocated from another country to take up employment here and now I am stuck as I have to repay them the relocation benefits that they offered. So I need a job at the earliest before I get into debt. 

Do I leave the company out of my CV which will create a gap of 1 year from my previous internship or do I keep it and explain that I wasn't a good fit for so & so reason?
