Formatting or Formation I'm a bit confused about the two words. To my Finnish self they both seem to have a similar meaning of morphing or the definition of a structure, and some dictionaries confirm that. I'm thinking of the words in terms of \"the doing of...\". I couldn't find a name for that kind of class though, even in Finnish, so let's call them ingverbs.Forgive me for the extra jargon, but I think it's helpful to explain the context. A database has objects, such as tables which hold data and procedures which operate on that data. Those tables need to be defined precisely in order to have proper structure.My original sentence was: \"One must make sure each object is formatted and maintained properly.\"And the sentence I'd like to construct is one of these:The formatting and maintenance of the objects...The formation and maintenance of the objects...So my questions are:Is formation an ingverb of format?If not, what is the difference in meaning?P.S. If you know a name for the class ingverb, please comment, so we can get rid of that thing.
