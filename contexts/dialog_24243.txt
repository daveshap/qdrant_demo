WOOLRIDGE: My name's Jerry Woolridge.
MARSHA: Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
WOOLRIDGE: Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
MARSHA: Yes sir.
WOOLRIDGE: I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
MARSHA: Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
WOOLRIDGE: Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage. Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
MARSHA: No thank you.
WOOLRIDGE: The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
