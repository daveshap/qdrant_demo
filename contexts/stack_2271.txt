What happened to Martin Septim after the Avatar of Akatosh became stone? (Spoilers) At the end of the main questline for Oblivion, Martin Septim <blockquote>  breaks the Amulet of the Kings to summon Akatosh, in which Akatosh put an end to the Crisis.</blockquote>However, Martin disappeared, and both the game itself and all sources I read through are vague on his fate. What happened to him? I figured he simply died, but I am unsure.
