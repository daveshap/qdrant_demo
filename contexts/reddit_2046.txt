Admissions Journey Timeline -- Looking at you, Rising Juniors and Rising Seniors (Updated Spring 2019)

[Link to u/LightningInADream's Post, "Here's What I Learned The Hard Way." with lots of his advice and advice from fellow seniors.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bah3y8/juniorsunderclassmen_heres_what_ive_learned_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

This is basically an abbreviated version of pretty much everything I say throughout the year; hopefully, it's organized in a way you can find useful.

Junior year is where your college admissions journey starts for real. Unlike freshman and sophomore year, you now have quite a few items to tick off your to-do list, but don't freak out if you're already a spring semester junior — or even a rising senior. You have plenty of time to get all this done.

Please note that my views about this might be different than the advice you hear from other sources or even other students. My philosophy is that it’s good to hear different thoughts and ideas, and then you can make decisions about what works best for you.

## Rising Junior Summer (Summer before Junior Year)

**GET INVOLVED WITH STUFF**

* Yourself (Exercise healthy habits, engage in personal hobbies and projects, READ real books, get a job, learn something new that’s good for your brains like guitar or Italian, practice mindfulness and meditation).
* Your family (Help with sibs or grandparents, grocery shopping, clean up around the house, or take care of dinner one night a week).
* Your community (Community service can be totally individual projects and/or organized group projects. Volunteer to play your instrument or play games at a retirement home, coach a kids’ team, make sandwiches at a food bank, or make comfort bags and drop off healthy snacks and water to the homeless).

**GET A SUMMER JOB:** Just an old-fashioned summer job. This will give you all sorts of skills you won’t gain by volunteering and also demonstrate leadership, diligence, a willingness to step outside your comfort zone. A summer job also shows determination and resiliency. Make some smoothies or scoop ice cream or fold sweaters. It really doesn’t matter what it is. Being responsible to a boss and customers for a paid job requires different skills than an unpaid internship.

**PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE PSAT:** You take it in October, and it helps you qualify for National Merit if you score high enough.

**PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE ACT and SAT:** Take a couple of practice tests and see which one feels better to you and which one you score higher on. Then move forward with that one. Consider taking one in December of the junior year. Definitely take one in the early part of the spring semester. It’s nice to have testing completed before you start senior year.

**TAKE SAT SUBJECT TESTS:** Especially if you are considering applying to highly selective schools. Take one or two in June or August that fit with classes you’ve just studied.

**ENJOY YOUR SUMMER:** This is super important. You need to take time to recharge your batteries. That’s part of being involved with yourself. Be sure to take some time completely off from school and college admissions stuff.

**START YOUR RESUME:** If you haven’t already, make a list of all the activities you’ve been involved in since freshman year. Keep in mind that basically anything you do outside of class time, homework, and test prep counts as an EC, so that includes old-fashioned summer or part-time jobs, home and family responsibilities, elderly and child care, personal projects and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to more traditional research, internships, and in-or-out-of-school clubs and sports. If you use the Coalition App, you can start on your application “locker.” Keep this list updated throughout the next two years. Create the following categories: Education, Extracurriculars, Work Experience, Community Service, Interests and Hobbies, Awards, Honors

**EXPLORE THE WORLD OF ADMISSIONS:**   Read some college admissions websites and blogs. Some of my favorites are Georgia Tech, MIT, Tulane, Harvard, and Tufts. They are open about the realities and anxieties of college admissions.

# Junior Fall

Pretty much all of the summer stuff applies still.

**TAKE THE HARDEST COURSE LOAD YOU CAN:** Colleges say that your course rigor counts for more than your GPA and test scores. Remember they evaluate you in the context of your school. So don’t worry about classes that aren’t offered. I recommend that you take four years of:

* Science (including Biology, Chemistry, and Physics)
* Foreign Language (many highly selective colleges like to see it. I know you don’t want to. It’s also good for your brain)
* English
* Math (ending in calculus if it’s offered -- or higher)
* Social Science (History, Gov, etc).

**GET TO KNOW YOUR TEACHERS:** Visit them at office hours. You will be asking them for teacher recommendations later. Speak up in class. Ask for help when you need it.

**KEEP UP YOUR GRADES:** I know you know this is the most important year for you as far as grades go. That said, an A- or B in a class isn’t going to kill your chances of going to college. In fact, there are hundreds of truly amazing colleges that are looking for B students. Just keep doing your work. Go to tutorials if you need tutorials. Meet with your teachers after class. Ask the smartest person in the class to tutor you if you need help. Watch Khan Academy and other Youtube videos if you’re struggling. Don’t wait and get far behind. Be proactive and start trying to bring up those grades now

**READ READ READ:** Reading will improve your test scores and your essay writing. Read real books, magazines, newspapers, and more real books. Read books that are required for school and books just for fun. I can suggest lots — just ask.

**KEEP PREPPING AND PRACTICING FOR THE ACT AND SAT:** Start testing in the late fall or early spring of Junior Year.

**STAY INVOLVED:** Keep up with everything I listed for summer. Also, get involved with your school. Join a club or two that interests you. Create a club if you don’t see one that interests you. Or simply do individual activities that add to your school environment. Sit with someone new at lunch once a week. Make an effort to say hello to two new people a week. Find a need and fill it. Or, as [this Georgia Tech blog says, ](http://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2019/04/12/which-activities-will-make-me-competitive/) find what makes you happy, and do it.

**CHECK IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR:** See what they have to advise and how the process works at your school. Every school is slightly different.

# Junior Spring

**LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION:** Ask two or three teachers who know you best to write your letters. I encourage you to ask junior year teachers who teach you in core academic subjects. I prefer one from a STEM subject and one from a humanities subject, but some colleges have certain expectations, so be sure to read college admissions websites about what they are looking for. Ask your teacher in person or by email and then follow up either in person or by email. Be sure to include a basic info cheat sheet about you for them and a resume. Now’s the time to start thinking about which teachers you should approach for LORs.

LOR Cheat Sheet has your resume with your most important activities on it, and then it also has your answers to the following questions:

* What was your favorite part of the class?
* What was your most memorable activity or project
* What part of the class did you find most difficult?
* What did you learn that you will carry with you after class and why?
* Be sure to write a thank you note to the teachers who say yes.

**COLLEGE VISITS:** Start visiting colleges if you can. Look around in your city or town. Visit large schools and small schools. It doesn’t matter if it’s a college you think you might consider or not. Just go to start thinking about what feels right to you. Hang out on campus. Be sure to check out my new app, College Vizzy, and use it if you are visiting campuses to help make your visit more meaningful for you and to share your thoughts and experiences with those who can't visit. It's available in Phase 1 version on the app store now.

Then, if you can go on college visits to schools you might find interesting, do so.

* Be sure at this point to sign in and go on the tour and info session, but also wander around.
* Sit on a bench and eavesdrop on conversations. Do you like what you hear?
* Talk to students. Ask them what they’d like to change about their school. Or what they do on a Wednesday night. Don’t be shy. They remember what it was like to be a prospective student and, even if they are annoyed by your questions, who cares? They don’t know you and won’t remember you. Move on and find a kinder person.
* Check out the dining hall and the gym.
* Look for the area near campus where kids hang out if there is one. Lots of kids try to go on spring break trips to visit colleges if it’s affordable.
* If you can’t afford to visit out of your area, at the very least check out the colleges near you to get a feel for the kind of vibe that works for you.

**COLLEGE LIST:** Now’s the time to start coming up with your preliminary lists. If you can visit colleges, that’s the best way to learn about them, but also you can lot on the internet, social media, and by reading books.

* Reddit: A2C, colleges’ subreddits, and reverse chance mes.
* Colleges’ websites. Sign up to receive info and get on their mailing lists.
* Common Data Set.  Google college name and common data set.
* Colleges’ social media accounts. They are putting tons of info out there on Instagram, twitter, facebook, and snapchat. Clean up your account and use your real name and then you get brownie points for interest with those who consider demonstrated interest -- and it’s also super helpful to know more as you write your Why College essays! \*College Vizzy App
* Colleges’ newspapers and news feeds.
* [Niche.com](https://feeds.niche.com/)
* “Colleges that Change Lives” by Loren Pope (book and website)
* “College Match” by Steve Antonoff
* “The Best 382 Colleges” by Princeton Review
* “The FISKE Guide” by Edward Fiske
* “Insider’s Guide to Colleges” by Yale Daily News Staff
* “Where You Go is not Who You’ll Be” by Frank Bruni

**SOMETHING TO CONSIDER… Your SureFire Safety School** \-- Make sure you have at least one Sure-Fire Safety School and a selection of other colleges with a variety of levels of selectivity. A sure-fire safety school is a school where your stats, scores, and grades qualify you for automatic or direct admissions AND you would like to go there, AND they are a financial safety. Any school that does holistic admissions is not a sure-fire safety until you have been admitted. I like to see kids apply to a few schools with rolling admissions early on, so they can have that safety out of the way. You must LOVE your safety. Research it and imagine yourself there.

**COLLEGE FIT:** Start thinking about what you want in a college and compile a big old list. Having a ton of schools on this initial list is ok. As you explore yourself and the colleges more as you go through the admissions journey, you will naturally begin to filter schools out. This includes thinking about and potentially creating a spreadsheet for:

* *Financials:* Will you need full financial aid?  Will you qualify for any aid? Do you need full merit aid? These are crucial considerations. You and your parents need to spend some time thinking about this and going through net price calculators on various college websites. If you can’t afford the price of a school, it’s not a good fit.
* *Geography:* What areas of the country appeal to you? Open your mind here, too. I can’t tell you how many kids say no to the Deep South or Midwest without really thinking about it, and in doing so, deprive themselves of some excellent options and merit aid. Also, do you want urban? Do you want rural? Do you want an enclosed campus or one that’s incorporated into the cityscape? Do you want beaches? Mountains? Corn fields? Do you want to get out of your comfort zone here or stay with the familiar?
* *Weather:* Also important. If you really, really hate the cold, then moving to Boston or Chicago or Maine might not appeal to you. If you have to have four seasons, then the Midwest or the northeast might have good options.
* *School Culture and Vibe:* Are you looking for that stereotypical American big college experience with the big game on the weekends? Or are you looking for the quirky school? Or something that has it all?
* *School Size:* Do you want a big ole state school with loads of options? Or are you looking for something smaller or even mid-sized? Do you want discussion-based classes where you can develop strong relationships with your professors or are do you want to be in big lectures where you can take notes or go to sleep?
* *Potential Major:* If you don’t have one, don’t worry. You have plenty of time to figure that out, and it actually frees you up a bit. If you do think you know, research some schools that might be strong in your major. Maybe touch base with a professor or two.
* *Your Stats:* Where do your grades and test scores fit in? Are they right there in the middle? I like my students to be well above the 50% for most of the colleges they are applying to. This requires putting a lot of thought into what you want out of your experience and about who you are and who you want to be. It doesn’t require pulling out U.S. News \&amp; World Report and listing the top twenty schools.

**ADMISSIONSMOM'S COLLEGE BOOK CLUB:** (I don’t actually have a book club, just a list of books you should read.) Here are a few of the books I recommend:  *The Fiske Guide*, *Colleges that Change Lives*, and *Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be*, *Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit*. See my list later in this post for a full list.

**COLLEGE RESEARCH SPREADSHEET:** Include info like test score averages, requirements, distance from home, school size, programs that might interest you, climate, and anything else you feel might be important. Email me ([dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com)) for the one I use.

**NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE OR TIME:** Make a No College-Talk Zone or Time in your house. In my house, our kitchen table was a NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE. That’s hard to do when you’ve got a mom who’s pretty obsessed with college admissions, but we worked at it. For other families I know, it might be all day on Sundays. This will help you and your parents keep your sanity during the next year. Otherwise, your house and family will be consumed with talking about college admissions from dawn to dusk in every room in your home for the next year. That’s not healthy for any of you.

**NET PRICE CALCULATORS:** Sit with your parents and do the net price calculators at a few colleges. Begin the financial conversations.

**NEW COLLEGE EMAIL ADDRESS:** Make a new college-only email address to use for college applications and communications. Make it appropriate! I recommend this because then all your info from colleges won’t get mixed up in your other emails. I encourage you to allow your parents to have access to it if you feel comfortable with it. Be sure to check your junk, trash, and spam inboxes, so you don't miss important info!

**CHECK IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR:** They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have their own processes you need to follow.

**COLLEGE INFO SESSIONS:** If a college comes to your town or close to your town or school, go listen. Make sure you sign up and sign in.

**COLLEGE FAIRS:** Go to them! Talk. Ask questions. Learn.

**WRITE:** I know you hear so much about the Terrifying College Essay…. But guess what? It’s not! Even the timidest of writers begin to like writing the college essay and experiencing the soul searching. My advice is a little different than most college essay coaches and counselors in that I don’t think you should start working on your essays too early. I DO think you should practice writing. Here are my tips for getting ready to write killer college essays.

* Write Every Day. Even if it’s just a sentence or two.
* Read and listen to essays on [www.thisibelieve.org](http://www.thisibelieve.org). These aren’t college essays, but there are hundreds of amazing personal essays about all sorts of subjects. I like that they aren't college essays.
* Check out [www.collegeessayguy.com](http://www.collegeessayguy.com), and start perusing his stuff. His website is brimming with tips, hints, and suggestions about writing college essays.
* Practice just writing in your voice--like you’re writing to us here on reddit. Admissions counselors want to get to know you in your essays, not be impressed by you. Your application with your shiny stats and activities is for impressing. Your essays are for expressing.
* Try to avoid reading college essays or “essays that got in.” There is no set formula or way to write these essays, and when you read those, then you get trapped in the “this is what a personal essay should look like” mindset. It’s not pretty, and it causes you great amounts of stress and, quite frankly, a lot of repetitive, boring essays for the reader. I can’t tell you how many essays I’ve now read that start with “The sweat dripped down my brow as I (tortured my way through the math exam, debate tournament, community service project, track meet…..” You pick). I will be writing a lot more about what I feel like you need to do for strong personal essays and supplements. \*I’ll be happy to share my essay resources with you. Email me at [dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com).

**READ BOOKS:** Seriously, reading is the best way to write well, write deeply, have good interviews, and be prepared to do your standardized testing. You should make yourself read every night or day. Even for just five minutes. Reading good fiction and also self-help books will help you learn to discover your voice. Here’s a list of fantastic books to read. Some are just for fun, and others help with stress, but all of these writers have a strong voice in their writing, and you feel the person on the other side of the page. That’s an important skill to think about as you prepare to write your personal essays.

**TAME THE ADMISSIONS STRESS MONSTER:** Dealing with your stress as you go through this next year is key. There will be times you feel overwhelmed, frustrated, angry, and sad. So, how do you deal with it? What do you do? Besides post and comment on a2c??? :))

* Be involved. And be involved for you and what you want and like to do, not just to create a list for your apps. The kids who are the most disappointed and stressed out are the ones who feel like they’ve sacrificed their lives for their college apps.
* Get a job. This might be a good time to get a job and start saving money for the things you will need in school. An old fashioned job where you earn just a little but learn a lot from the experience of taking care of customers or working with others who might never have the chance to work with is invaluable at this time. It also can help you with time management.
* Practice gratitude 🙏. Make a daily list of things you are thankful for. Even during all your stress, what is good? Are you happy for air conditioning or heating? Are you grateful for ice cream? Or for that amazing teacher who sparked something in you. There’s nothing too small here, but when we stop and think about it, it can take away some of the anxiety and stress.
* Be like Elsa and Let. It. Go. If Disney Cartoons aren’t your style, maybe this story about monkeys and coconuts will resonate. Hunters attach a coconut to a tree, cut a hole in it, and place a banana 🍌 inside. A monkey comes along and puts his hand through the hole and grabs the banana. The unfortunate thing is the hole is too small for his fist to get back through, so he is stuck sitting by that tree holding on to the banana. To be free, all he has to do is let go of the banana.
* Horses with flies. This is a silly one, but it can help! So, you know how horses make their skin quiver when a fly lands on them? That’s what you do here. It’s a super quick tension reliever. First, shake your hands, then your arms, then your head, then your feet, and your legs, and your belly. Raise your hands high over your head while shaking, and then quickly drop down and reach for your toes and come up. Make sure you make a silly noise when you drop down! Then, feel how alive your body feels and pay attention to that smile on your face!
* LEAN IN.  Lean into your fear, frustration, anxiety, and stress. Right now this is what it is, so tell it to come on in. Sometimes, just saying that makes it ok. It is knowing that this is just what’s happening right now and it’s ok. It’s ok to be stressed and worried. It’s normal. Don’t try to run away or suppress it. Lean in and face it and embrace it. Think about it. Assess it. If something is making you afraid, that can often be an indicator that you’re doing the right thing! I know this drives some of you up the wall bat-shit crazy when we say it, but remember this experience is so much about the journey and not the outcome. And you will learn more about yourself from any perceived “failures” or disappointments than acceptances to a particular school. It’s true. It pisses you off when we say it, but it’s true.
* Mindful Meditation. Take three minutes every day and focus on your breathing. That’s all — no need to clear your brain. Just focus on your breath. Be mindful of what’s happening to you. Is your mind wandering? Cool! That means you’ve been successful with your mindful meditation because you discovered that your mind had wandered away from focusing on your breathing. It’s no biggie. Just come back to your breath. This is such a simple practice, and so many people get caught up in the “I could never clear my brain. Or I can’t relax” part, but that’s not what it’s about. You don’t have to clear your brain or relax. There are no rules. Just focus on your breathing for three minutes. It’s that simple.
* Move. Exercise. Go outside. Get Fresh Air. Eat Healthy Food

**OTHER…** If you are a low-income applicant, I want you to be aware of and explore these amazing programs and possible options, if you’re not already:

* Questbridge Program:[ https://www.questbridge.org/](https://www.questbridge.org/)
* Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholarship Program:[ http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/](http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/)
* The Posse Foundation:[ https://www.possefoundation.org/](https://www.possefoundation.org/)

Juniors, you are in for the journey of your life. By this time next year, you will know far more about yourself than you ever thought possible. Keep in mind that failure, disappointment, frustration, and feelings of being overwhelmed are all part of this journey -- just as much or maybe even more so as the excitement, anticipation, and dreaming. Every stumble, and bump in the road will make you stronger.

I'm looking forward to watching your transformations; you got this! This is a prime opportunity for you to take advantage of digging in and getting to know who you are. Instead of focusing so much on getting in, let’s instead focus on getting inward.

# Rising Senior Summer

What to do? What to do? This is an important summer for you, but there is no magical formula of what you need to or have to do to get into any colleges-- even the most highly selective ones. Sure, you can research in a lab ( you get those positions by emailing any and every professor you know or who you can find doing research you’re interested in). Or you can get an internship (you get those the same way as research). Or you can do a program somewhere on a campus or around the world. Those are all great ways to spend your summer. You can also do independent projects. But, don’t forget the good old fashioned summer job. You can actually stand out from the applicant crowd these days by making a smoothie, flipping a burger, or scooping ice cream. These kinds of job allow you to learn about taking care of others and listening to what the customer wants, learn about organizing your thoughts and activities, learn to work with others and gain some experiences you might never have the chance to gain again.

Here’s what William Fitzsimmons, Dean of Harvard Admissions, says about summer: “Bring summer back. Summer need not be totally consumed by highly structured programs, such as summer schools, travel programs, or athletic camps. While such activities can be wonderful in many ways, they can also add to the stress by assembling “super peers” who set nearly impossible standards. Activities in which one can develop at one’s own pace can be much more pleasant and helpful. An old-fashioned summer job that provides a contrast to the school year or allows students to meet others of differing backgrounds, ages, and life experiences is often invaluable in providing psychological downtime and a window on future possibilities. Students need ample free time to reflect, to recreate (i.e., to “re-create” themselves without the driving pressure to achieve as an influence), and to gather strength for the school year ahead.” link is here:[ https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/preparing-college/should-i-take-time](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/preparing-college/should-i-take-time)

**Finish up testing.** SAT, ACT, and subject tests

**BE INVOLVED** (see above)

**RECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES:** Take time to care for your mental health and your body. Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Breathe. Listen to books or podcasts. Hang out with friends.

**WRITE:** “Write like a motherf\*cker,” as one of my favorite writers, Cheryl Strayed says. Write about yourself. Don’t worry too much about the essays just yet. Just write. Everyday. Get used to your voice. See my WRITE from Junior Spring. Figure out who you are.

Email me ([dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com)) and ask for my list of questions to get you going. This will help you get that Personal Statement ready to go by October 1. Use this super cool app/website that some of the A2C kiddoes have taught me about-- [www.the](http://www.the) mostdangerouswritingapp.comStart asking yourself some hard and kinda silly questions. You can practice answering these in themostdangerouswritingapp.com! I’ve had students write stunning essays just by answering these questions:

* What do you think about when you wake up in the morning?
* What do you worry about?
* What’s your secret sauce?
* What’s your superpower?
* What’s the last thing you think about before you go to sleep?
* Who are your role models and why?
* What’s your favorite comfort food?
* When you’re in your room at night, what do you look at?
* What makes you smile?

**THINK ABOUT AND PRACTICE WRITING THE PERSONAL ESSAY:** Remember — no matter which prompt you choose or which kind of vehicle or conceit you use to relay your message — the topic is YOU. Focus on teaching the admissions officers about who you are. Don’t worry about being unique; worry about who you are. Don’t worry about standing out; worry about sticking with the reader. You do that by creating connections and bonds. Those are created by opening yourself up and letting them inside. Let the reader know what’s happening inside you. They want to know what you think about, what you believe, and what you value. They don’t need to hear a whole lot more about what you’ve already told them in other areas of your application. Focus on More Expressing, Less Impressing.  I'll be happy to share my essay resources with you, including the essay chapter from my new book, "Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit", if you email me at [dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com).

**MAKE A COMMON APP and COALITION ACCOUNT:** Start filling out the details like activities, family info, and educational background.

**UPDATE YOUR RESUME** (Or create it if you haven’t done so yet.): see description above

**VISIT COLLEGES if you can:** see description above

**START YOUR COLLEGE LIST:** Start narrowing down your list — including a wide range of selectivities. Make sure you have at least one SFSS (SureFire Safety School). What is a SureFire Safety School you ask? As a reminder, a SureFire Safety School is often your most important school. It’s one:

* where you have direct/auto/guaranteed admissions based on your stats
* OR you’ve already been admitted via ED, EA or Rolling
* AND you can see yourself being happy there
* AND it works financially for you and your family.

**KEEP IN TOUCH WITH COLLEGES:** Sign up to "request info" from every college you’re interested in — even if you’re already getting info from them because they bought it from a testing company. Also, I recommend that you follow the admissions offices on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for the colleges on your list or potential list. They often put out a lot of helpful information for what's happening in their offices. I suggest following the Common App, too. Also, it’s totally ok to occasionally contact your regional college admissions officers or the general front desk with questions.

# Senior Fall

All of the above....plus:

Finish up any **college visits especially for EARLY DECISION POSSIBILITIES.**

**COLLEGE LIST:** Begin to narrow your college list. Make sure you have one or two SureFire Safeties (see above) that you love and that will be good financial fits, as well as a collection of matches, reaches, and lotteries (if that’s your thing).

**COLLEGE APPLICATION SPREADSHEET:** Make a spreadsheet for all your colleges. Add application deadlines. Supplemental Essay topics — and look for overlap. Testing info. Contact info for your regional officer. Email me ([dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com](mailto:dearadmissionsmom@gmail.com)) for a spreadsheet.

**FILLING OUT APPLICATIONS:** Start with the details if you didn't do it in the summer. Fill out activities, family history, etc.

**EARLY ACTION:** Try to apply to as many schools by Early Action as are available. Make a calendar of deadlines and essay requirements and work through them one by one.

**FAFSA AND CSS:** Make accounts and start gathering and filling out information.

**FINANCIAL AID:** Reach out to the financial aid offices of schools on your list and establish a relationship with them.

**LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION:** Check back in with your recommenders. Send them a reminder email and stop by if you can. Be sure to give them a big thank you! (Also give them a resume and "cheat sheet" if you haven't yet.)

**YOUR HIGH SCHOOL GUIDANCE COUNSELOR:** Check in with your guidance counselor or college counselor if you aren't in regular contact. They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have their own processes you need to follow.

**SAT/ACT/SUBJECT TESTS:** Finish up any testing you have left to do. Be sure to check colleges’ websites for their last accepted testing dates. 

**SUBMIT TEST SCORES:** Submit your test scores in plenty of time for deadlines to the schools who don't allow self-report. Be sure to check the colleges’ admissions websites to find when they need to be submitted.
