Does anyone else feel jinxed when it comes to relationships?
People I’m not interested in, get friggin obsessed and text / call / FaceTime me a million times in a row, 

Meanwhile The second I become interested in someone they completely stop answering or disappear

Anyone else feel like this?

Edit: wow I did not expect this to blow up so much! Thanks for all your responses, Reddit! I’m glad we can all share this ridiculousness in common
