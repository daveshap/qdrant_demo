VASILI: I thought you say Tuesday.
MURPHY: Better late than never.
VASILI: What's this?
MURPHY: You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
VASILI: No, no. You got leak.
MURPHY: You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
VASILI: That cost me twenty grand at least.
MURPHY: Fifteen, at the most.
VASILI: Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
MURPHY: You're kidding, right?
VASILI: You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
GREER: Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
MURPHY: He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
GREER: I must be in the wrong business.
MURPHY: You got that right.
GREER: Better than making hamburger for Mickey D.""
