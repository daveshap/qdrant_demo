EDDIE: Daddy, did ya see that?
JOE: What?
EDDIE: Guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.
VIC: You fuckin' wish.
EDDIE: You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
VIC: Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
EDDIE: No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
VIC: I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
EDDIE: Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
