MIRACLE MAX: An hour.
VALERIE: Yeah, an hour.
MIRACLE MAX: A good hour. Yeah.
INIGO: Thank you for everything.
MIRACLE MAX: Okay. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 97.
VALERIE: Bye-bye, boys.
MIRACLE MAX: Have fun storming the castle.
VALERIE: Think it'll work?
MIRACLE MAX: It would take a miracle. Bye!
VALERIE: Bye.
FEZZIK: Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
INIGO: What's the difference? We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
FEZZIK: Has it been fifteen minutes?
INIGO: We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.

FEZZIK: How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
INIGO: Your guess is as good as mine --
WESTLEY: I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
