MIKEY: Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
CLIFF: I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
MIKEY: You going to get married?
CLIFF: Maybe.
MIKEY: You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
CLIFF: Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
MIKEY: Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice. But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
CLIFF: Hey, Mikey--
MIKEY: I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
CLIFF: Mikey--
MIKEY: Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
CLIFF: Mikey--
MIKEY: If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
CLIFF: Mikey look at this--
MIKEY: What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
CLIFF: It's a .45.
MIKEY: Yeah?
CLIFF: This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
MIKEY: They were using M-1's, yeah--
CLIFF: What's it doing on a rifle range?
