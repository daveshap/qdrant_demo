Why didn't the PPDC consider rebuilding Crimson Typhoon? So I watched Pacific Rim again last week, and one scene stuck in my head since then, the destruction of Crimson Typhoon in the battle of Hong Kong Bay.Compared to the Jaegers that were destroyed in the first movie, Crimson Typhoon is the least damaged Jaeger out of the 4 remaining Jaegers prior to their respective destruction scenes. I mean, the head was just ripped off and nothing else, albeit some fall damage after it fell into the Bay, but that is the extent of the damage overall, right? I mean, when compared to Cherno Alpha, Typhoon got off easy.So then that raises the question, if the PPDC reinstated the Jaeger program after the battle of the Breach, why wasn't the reconstruction of Crimson Typhoon considered in the slightest?
