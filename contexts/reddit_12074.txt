Okay, I need help on ssomething that's bugging me
So my ex told me that she wants to get back together but at first I wasn't sure, but then when I asked her out like 2 days later she said she wasn't sure. That was last week and yesterday she just kissed me for no reason out of nowhere, but today she seemed like she didn't want to be with me.
