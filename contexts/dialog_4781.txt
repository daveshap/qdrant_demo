SAM: Bloody hell! Do as I say!
JILL: No.
SAM: Please!
SAM: Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer - DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them!
JILL: Them?
SAM: Us. Them. I don't know ... just get going.
JILL: Don't litter my cab!
SAM: Oh, sorry.
SAM: ... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
JILL: I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
SAM: Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
JILL: Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
SAM: I don't know. Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say.
SAM: You know, smoking's bad for you.
JILL: It's my fucking life.
SAM: Yes, of course. Sorry.
JILL: I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
SAM: Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
JILL: I didn't run away. I left the flat.
SAM: Why?
JILL: I didn't like it.
SAM: Why not?
JILL: It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
JILL: Where are you taking me?
SAM: What?
JILL: Where are you taking me?
SAM: Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
JILL: It does doesn't it?
SAM: Where are you taking me?
