How are the United States approaching corporate concentration and what regulatory lessons can we learn from the twentieth century?
To quote one of my sources below:^[1](https://orionmagazine.org/article/the-curse-of-bigness/) 

> It’s an old story, and it bears repeating: Government subsidies favor large-scale standardized activity (in farming, manufacturing, retail — the list is long) at the expense of the local, the small, the diverse, the upstart. By 2005, four firms controlled 60 percent of the nation’s grain business. The four largest meatpackers controlled 70 percent of beef supply. In some states, the four largest grocery chains controlled as much as 88 percent of all retail sales. Today, a handful of merged energy companies, the Big Five, dominate the petroleum business, with ExxonMobil, Chevron-Texaco, Conoco-Phillips, BP, and Royal Dutch / Shell proving, in the words of Lord Browne, former chief executive of British Petroleum, that “many of the components of the old Standard Oil [trust have] been brought together.” The pattern of oligopoly holds in banking (Citigroup, Chase, and Bank of America now issuing one out of every two mortgages, two out of every three credit cards), accounting, tobacco, automobiles (the triopoly of GM, Ford, and Chrysler), defense, steel, telecommunications (Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint-Nextel), pharmaceuticals, airlines (Delta, American, United), in every major stage of the food business (even including grain elevator storage), and in the generation, transmission, and local distribution of electricity.

To clarify, I use the word *are* in the title because I believe the United States is a union of sovereign states populated by citizens and non-citizens.  If you attempt to answer this question, just know that I’m inquiring about both federal and state legislation in this policy area.  

* (1)  How do governments enforce anti-trust law and what qualities do they ascribe to success?

* (2)  Are labor unions powerful enough to reign in the excesses of multinational companies?

* (3)  Would the UK Labour Party's plan, entitled Alternative Models of Ownership^[2](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Alternative-Models-of-Ownership.pdf), be implementable in the United States?  Is it a sound policy choice?
* (4) How do different economic philosophies account for and affect anti-competition law?

* (5) Is our current mode of ownership and capital accumulation sustainable; moreover, is it worth maintaining? 

* (6)  Are Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple members of one or more oligopoly(s)?

* (7) Does the American economy suffer from a curse of bigness?^[3](https://orionmagazine.org/article/the-curse-of-bigness/)
