PITTS: But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
CHARLIE: So much the better.
KNOX: Chris!
CHRIS: Knox, why are you doing this to me?
KNOX: You can't be in here.
KNOX: If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
CHRIS: Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
KNOX: I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
CHRIS: Well, you did! Chet found out and he's nuts. It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
KNOX: But I love you.
CHRIS: You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
