College educations on job applications
I’m worried about my degree being seen as less than compared to someone that has a specific degree. I going get associates in general education with a lot of business classes; the only reason I didn’t get a business degree is that I wasn’t sure that’s what I wanted. Going into college, I wasn’t sure about which classes to take, so I wanted to be able to experiment without having to change my major every time the wind changed direction. I’m only a semester away from my degree, and someone told me that employers might look down on my degree because they might see me as uncommitted and impulsive. Can anyone offer any more insight? When I go for my bachelor's it will be in a more specific field, but I need to get a job soon. Thank you.
