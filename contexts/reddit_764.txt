Why school stresses me out. What to do...?
Most of the time, students don’t look forward to school starting again. The work, being social, just about all of it. My issue, however, is..surprise surprise.. body image.

I’m unlucky enough to end up at a Catholic school. A private school in which we have to wear uniforms. Green shirt, khaki skirts. 

I’ve dealt with Anorexia and Bulimia for years now, and I’ve just recently gotten comfortable eating solids again. Our uniform is the worst for people like me. I go to therapy, I take medication, but all it helps with is Anxiety.  I’ve gotten more social,more calm,  and my grades are better than ever. 

But I completely fall apart when it comes to body issues. I just tried my uniform on today and I broke down. It made me so sad I got sick and threw up. I might end up not eating anything for days on end once school starts.. 

I’m scared, but my mom is so goddamn stubborn about keeping me in that school.  I know that most of it holds in my thought, but nothing like that has done anything for me in the end. I really, really don’t know what to do.
