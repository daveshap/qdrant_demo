Volunteering in SA
I'm a current graduate student in HESA in DC, but my background does not reflect my passion for SA (BS Psychology, mostly research, etc). I have been having issues finding a work in the field to satisfy a graduation requirement, but I have been told volunteering is an option. Has anyone volunteered with an organization that relates to SA? My major passions are helping underrepresented students enter, persist, and graduate college.
