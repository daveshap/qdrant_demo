Received job offer from 2nd choice, how and when do I tell 1st choice? We already have a second interview scheduled
I'm nearing the end of my job search phase with 2 leads (1st and 2nd choice). Yesterday I had an interview with 1st choice that went well and was called back today for a second interview on Tuesday at 4pm. 

I also received a job offer today from 2nd choice which I had to ask for an extension from the coming Monday to Friday to make a decision (+4 days). She was very accommodating and spoke to the manager on that... and asked about my situation which I only revealed "it's a different type of position and I want to make a thorough decision... should hear back next week." 

What I really need advice on is **how do I tell 1st choice that I need an answer before Friday?** We literally just spoke today. Should I email the recruiter ASAP or mention it at the interview on Tuesday? and how do I word this conversation / email?!

It's my first time posting and encountering this so I really appreciate all answers! If more detail is needed, happy to provide.
