Is there actually evidence in the leaked DNC emails of Hillary offering federal positions to large donors?
In the last 24 hours, articles claiming that Hillary offered federal positions to top donors have made it to the top of /r/SandersForPresident, /r/The_Donald and /r/politics as well as /r/all. 

The story still hasn't been picked up by any major outlet. This is one of those said articles that has risen to the top of the aforementioned subreddits: http://dailycaller.com/2016/07/24/leaked-dnc-documents-show-plans-to-reward-big-donors-with-federal-appointments/ 

It doesn't seem to give very concrete evidence so is the issue that the article is not very well researched and written or that there is a lack of concrete evidence?
