Should I say \"the trap that lay ahead\" or \"the trap that lie(s) ahead\"? Which is correct?My vision widened that day, and I began to see the trap that lay ahead for most people.My vision widened that day, and I began to see the trap that lie ahead for most people.Or maybe both are incorrect and some future tense of lie must be used?I am confused because someone is talking about his past and others\u2019 future that may or may not have faced the trap by the present. The trap the author talks about is kind of a fact of life.
