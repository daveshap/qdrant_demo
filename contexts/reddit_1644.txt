I made my parents proud for the first time :)
I've applied to a lot of colleges and have already been accepted by Pitt, Penn State, and Ohio State. I told my parents excitedly each time, but my parent's weren't as enthusiastic. They just said they expected it and kind of moved on with their day. But today, I woke up to my dad very ecstatically shaking me awake. I got a 40k scholarship to Pitt (10k a year) and my parents were so excited. Plus, my mom works at UPMC as a nurse (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the hospital associated with the college) so I get an extra 6k from her working there. Because of that, my tuition costs are reduced to 2k a year. I feel like I finally made my parents proud for the first time! I've never really felt that way before after everything I've done; my parents are also taking me and my sister out for lunch! I really like seeing all my hardwork from high school come back together and help me in the end. I never expected this for myself, but I'm so happy now that it's happened.
