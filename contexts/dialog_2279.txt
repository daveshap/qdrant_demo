EMMA: Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
STEED: As per mother's instructions.
EMMA: Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
STEED: For a man in my position --
EMMA: Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking. How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
STEED: They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
EMMA: I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
STEED: After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
EMMA: No thanks.
STEED: I meant me.
STEED: According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
EMMA: An eccentric recluse?
STEED: Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
EMMA: June, July ... August?
STEED: The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
EMMA: Any other vices?
STEED: All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY. British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
EMMA: So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
STEED: Small talk. Try the weather.
