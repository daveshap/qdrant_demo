Is it possible to survive just by absorbing food and water through your skin? Part 1 The outer layer of skin of a human is called the epidermis. It is supposed to be waterproof, however:Using any current science and substances, would it be possible for humans to survive for two months purely by absorbing substances through the epidermis? The skin must not be pierced or otherwise physically damaged. (Prune skin does not count as damage)There is no limit to how many hours  per day it takes. The subjects lie completely submerged in a bath of nutrients with breathing apparatus. They can get in and out but must not use any other source of food or water.ClarificationThe subjects are ordinary humans who are concerned about ageing. They have volunteered for an experiment. The crazy scientist has convinced them that if they stay there for two months (sedated to avoid claustrophobia but with VR glasses for entertainment) they will regain their youth. Assuming they can stand the discomfort, will they make it out alive or will they die or have to be rescued?
