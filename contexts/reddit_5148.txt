What’s with that other candidate? (Rant inside)
TLDR: how come they always pick the other candidate who isn’t necessarily better? Why am I never that other candidate? I either get rejected right away because I suck or am underqualified or I don’t suck but they pick the other underqualified candidate. 

I’ve been working for a huge telecom company for the past 5 years as a contractor and I have great relations with a lot of people who I work with. I even know the HR guys because I interviewed thrice for three different positions since June. So I just got my third rejection call. 

Nobody, not even once, told me I wasn’t qualified for the job I was interviewing for. Nobody told me I sucked at the interview or didn’t answer the questions well or didn’t ask smart questions. Not even because of my salary expectations. Even all my references who actually work there gave amazing feedback and recommended me. 

It has been a very tough decision to make but unfortunately after 3 long days and too much head scratching, the hiring manager decided to go with the other candidate who isn’t as good as you. I mean are you kidding me?!!! 

This time the dude went on and told me that there has been a lot of discussions and the people don’t want a great talent (me) to slip away and in the next 1 to 2 weeks they will create a vacancy just for me to put me in it. Like why don’t you just put me in one of the vacancies that you already have?! 

Sorry for the rant but honestly I was shocked and my legs couldn’t carry me that I had to rush to the nearest chair when the dude told the other candidate was picked. 

Should I expect them to open a vacancy for me or was this just some cheap consolation bs?
