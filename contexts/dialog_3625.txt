LAZARUS: I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
ANGELA: You didn't have to do this.
LAZARUS: Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
ANGELA: Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
