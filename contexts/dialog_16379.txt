PILAR: I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
AMADO: I can't take any more school.
PILAR: --you're going to be on your own.
AMADO: So?
PILAR: So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
AMADO: They're not going to jail.
PILAR: Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
AMADO: Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
PILAR: That makes it okay?
AMADO: They stole our land--
PILAR: Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
PILAR: How do you think you're going to make a living?
AMADO: I can fix cars.
PILAR: You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
AMADO: You think I can't learn that?
PILAR: I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
AMADO: I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
PILAR: That isn't true.
AMADO: Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
PILAR: If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
AMADO: It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
PILAR: I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
AMADO: And what did she do?
PILAR: Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
AMADO: Catholic school, nasty.
