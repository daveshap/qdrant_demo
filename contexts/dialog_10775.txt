PATTERSON: -oh, sing a different song, Abdullah- -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
ABDULLAH: -you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
PATTERSON: You think you matter? -Beaumont is on that train- he matters-
PATTERSON: He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
ABDULLAH: He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
PATTERSON: You think so? Fine. It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee-
PATTERSON: Pleasant journey?
BEAUMONT: How could it be? I hate Africa.
BEAUMONT: Lovely sound- they seem happy.
PATTERSON: Don't they, though?
BEAUMONT: So work must be going well?
PATTERSON: Truthfully? There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
BEAUMONT: But overall, you're pleased?
