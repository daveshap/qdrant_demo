WADE: What do I have to do for it?
LARIVIERE: Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
WADE: I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
LARIVIERE: So?
WADE: He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
LARIVIERE: Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
WADE: You? Why?
LARIVIERE: Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
WADE: That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
LARIVIERE: What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
WADE: Want to buy?
LARIVIERE: Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
WADE: I won't. You interested?
LARIVIERE: Maybe.
WADE: You and Mel Gordon?
LARIVIERE: Could be.
WADE: Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
