KATE: I think it’s good to be a little unsure about who you are. It’s very human.
JACK: But you always seem so certain.
KATE: C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
JACK: That’s a big one for me, too.
KATE: My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
JACK: Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
KATE: I mean yes, I help people that need it...
JACK: I guess...some of them are probably faking.
KATE: God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
KATE: Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
JACK: It’s wonderful...
