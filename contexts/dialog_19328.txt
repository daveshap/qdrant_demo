JOSIE: Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
ROB: This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was! I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
JOSIE: You're twenty-three years old!
ROB: With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
JOSIE: Hear one. Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
