I accidentally learnt US geography while researching for colleges.
If I didn't apply to US colleges, I would not have known that New York City and New York are two different things, Washington DC is not in Washington, the east coast and the west coast are actually far away (I didn't realized US is 30x bigger than my country), Canada is somehow between Alaska and the rest of the US, the Northern Midwest is actually cold af, there's a weird number of states that have a square or rectangular border, Ohio exists and is actually in the Midwest although Pennsylvania which is in the east coast is literally right next to ohio, ~~Wyoming does not exists~~ and now I'm committing to a university in Ohio for Fall!

I know it's not important but I just wanna share that with you guys.

Edit: I just found out that it's all Ohio.
