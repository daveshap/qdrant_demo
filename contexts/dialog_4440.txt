SMECKER: After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out. Why the two extra victims?
GREENLY: Witness?
SMECKER: No way they could have seen it.
SMECKER: Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's little fireman time.
DUFFY: No way they could have seen it?
SMECKER: Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why?
DOLLY: Maybe the three of them had something in common.
SMECKER: No. This guy is big time. These two are street-walking scum.
