How do I start my career at this age?
Dear Friends,   


I would like to know whether there is an online forum - inside or outside of reddit - where I can get a guidance on where to start my career. I'm from India and (for personal reasons) I am trying to somehow get abroad somewhere and start my life. I am 40 now, and haven't started my life yet. Till 2009 I was with an Indian Corporate, working in an Indian city. After that I went to UK and did my MA and MPhil in Philosophy. I came back to India in 2017 and since then I am without a job. Things are now becoming bad/serious that I am getting too depressed. Sometimes I do think about ending it all but I want to start my life and seriously don't want to end it before starting.   


I would like to have a one-on-one chat with a career counselor, to know my prospects. Sometimes I think I do not have any prospects at all which makes me so miserably depressed. I can't go on like this. I don't mind paying a nominal charge, but I need help to start/find a job. Is there a place where I can get help? Thank you all!
