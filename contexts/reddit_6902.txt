Laid off with unused PTO, will I be paid for it?
Not sure if this is a r/finance question, or a r/jobs question...

Been with this company for 4 years. 3.5 years working in PA (main office) and the last half year in FL (same position). I was laid off a month ago for business reasons which I understand. I received my last paycheck which was for the normal amount I would have earned, but have about 126 hours of unused PTO. Should I have been paid for the unused PTO? It seems unfair that I was saving it for a planned vacation, which my boss knew about, and not get compensated. I know different states have rules regarding PTO, but which state would I fall under? Technically speaking, I earned the PTO in PA before I moved to FL. PA has to pay for PTO, but FL doesn't. Is this something I should push on, or am I SOL?

tl;dr 

1. Should I have been paid for the unused PTO?

2.  Which state laws would I fall under, PA or FL?
