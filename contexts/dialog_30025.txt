BOBBY: Hey! Take it easy. Want to get us killed?
GRACE: You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
BOBBY: I don't know about that?
GRACE: You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
BOBBY: We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
GRACE: Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
BOBBY: I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
GRACE: Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
BOBBY: I'm not sailing his boat.
GRACE: But I thought --
BOBBY: We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
GRACE: Anywhere?
BOBBY: What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
GRACE: Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
BOBBY: You already have.
BOBBY: You know I thought you'd left me back there.
GRACE: What are you talking about?
