Applying to a assistant user experience librarian position. Looking for online courses that may enhance my resume.
I'm currently applying to an Assistant UX librarian position with a university. A little background of me is I have a BS in geology and currently working as a data analyst.
Are there any online course on usability studies or user experience in general that I can take to further enhance my resume?
Wondering if there are any librarians in a position similar to this that can give me some advice.

Thank you.
