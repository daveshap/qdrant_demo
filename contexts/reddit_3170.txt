Want to quit my first job after the first shift, what do I do?
I'm 18 and never had a job, so when I got an email saying I got accepted for the position of kitchen porter at a restaurant up town I was ecstatic. I thought, kitchen porter you just wash dishes and take out the bins, easiest thing ever! plus its Â£8 an hour plus tips. I thought I must have lucked out big time. But after 8 hours straight of nothing but washing dirty dishes, getting wet, moving around heaps of clean dishes and pans and knifes, mopping the floor at the end of the day, cleaning everything, drying everything, just when you think you maybe have done the bulk of the dishes and can relax a bit thats when the clock turns 8 and a tsunami of customers come in and you realise the past agonising 5 hours were mere childs play. on many occasions i thought about just completely walking out and not looking back. On my break they gave me something to eat which was nice (if only i didn't have to eat it on the fire exit stairs because the lounge was full) when eating it i found my self with tears pouring down my face onto the plate. After my 20 minutes were up I got back to it, and when the day was over and everything was as good as new for the chefs in the morning I finally got to go home at midnight, straight to bed with aching muscles everywhere. When i woke up i find that i can't move my right wrist too well and have rashes on both arms. my next shift is in 3 hours and i'm so tempted to not show up, sure the job is "easy" as in easy to understand what to do and where things go, but fucking hard physical labour. I talked about it to my mum but she said i must not quit and that its always like that. I'm torn between the dread of everyone being disappointed in me and the dread of having to go back to it all for another 8 hours. whether i should care about my physical and mental health or care about if everyone sees me as a failure. what the hell do i do?
