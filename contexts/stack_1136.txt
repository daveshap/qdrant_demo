SQL Server 2014: Graceful shutdown of an Availability Group node What I'm trying to do is to gracefully shut down one of two nodes in our SQL Server Availiability Group, effectively draining all the connections.Previously, we were just stopping the SQL Server instance on the node, but that results in a flurry of \"The specified network name is no longer available\" errors from client applications.What is the kosher way of shutting down a node?I'm no DBA here, so please, ask whatever questions you deem necessary.
