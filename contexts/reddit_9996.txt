Student Affairs Summer Internship Abroad?
I am starting a Student Affairs Masters program at Louisiana State University this Fall. As part of the program, I need to hold an internship next summer (2018). I would really like to find a student affairs internship abroad. But I am having trouble figuring out where to start. I am coming to learn that Student Affairs is a much different and larger game in the states. Does anyone have any advice of suggestions of schools/people to reach out to?
