Should I quit softball?
This season is coming up and starting in 3 weeks. I still don’t know if I’m playing and I’ve been thinking for the past 3 months and been unable to decide. I am in desperate need of some help

Summary of my situation:
I’m a sophomore this year and I was the only pitcher on my team last year. I was overworked and got an injury near the end of last season from repetitive motion in my shoulder. I went to PT all fall/winter and still can’t pitch or throw without pain. Anyway, last year I was miserable and was under so much pressure to constantly perform perfectly. The coach was also mean. I started to lose interest in softball, the sport I’ve been playing for 10 years. A lot of my friends are on the team too and I don’t want to let them down. I’ve talked to my coach and there most likely aren’t any other positions for me on the team, other than bench, since I can’t really pitch. 


I need to decide wether or not to play this season. I honestly can’t make a decision and nobody is really helping me. I am being persuaded to play by everyone I talk to (including my parents). My parents keep telling me to do it and sit on the sidelines all season and be a “team player.” I get how this is important, but it seems like such a waste of time to me if I’m going to be committing so much time to just observe.


Reasons I don’t want to play: 
- I’m worried about my shoulder and making it worse. 
- I hated it last year and didn’t have fun. 
- It was too stressful. 
- It took up all of my free time 6 days a week for 3 months. 
- I would have to quit my job that I’ve been working for 3 weeks at. 
- I wouldn’t be able to focus on my hobbies or school 
- I would be happier and better mentally. 


Reasons I want to play/things holding me back from quitting: 
- My friends are on the team and I might feel left out/ regret quitting 
- things might be better this year 
- I’ve been playing for such a long time and idk if I’m ready to let go. 
- I don’t want to piss my friends off and let down the team. 
- I would walk by my coach everyday and have a really awkward time in her gym class senior year. 
- I wouldn’t see a lot of my friends often. (I’m kind of introverted and don’t have many friends, so it would be hard for me to go out and make new ones)
- I would feel very bad for quitting and leaving the team to struggle. 


If anyone is still reading this and has anything to say, I would really really like to hear another perspective. Especially from someone who isn’t biased one way.
