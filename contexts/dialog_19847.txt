MOSS: Who is this.
CHIGURH: You know who it is.
CHIGURH: ...You need to talk to me.
MOSS: I don't need to talk to you.
CHIGURH: I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
MOSS: Why would I care where you're going.
CHIGURH: Do you know where I'm going?
CHIGURH: ...I know where you are.
MOSS: Yeah? Where am I?
CHIGURH: You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
MOSS: Yeah. I know where you're going.
CHIGURH: All right.
MOSS: You know she won't be there.
CHIGURH: It doesn't make any difference where she is.
MOSS: So what're you goin' up there for.
CHIGURH: You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
MOSS: No. Do you?
CHIGURH: Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
MOSS: Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
