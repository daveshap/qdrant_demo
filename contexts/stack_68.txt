MacBook Pro early 2015 not turning on and not charging I'm far away from civilization thats why I need your help guys. My problem is: MacBook Pro 13\" early 2015 is not turning on and charging and the trackpad is also dead.Charger's LED does not shine by any light(red/orange/green) . But I tested my charger with another MacBook and charger is working.I tried to connect another charger. First 1-2 minute I can see green light and then LED turns off.Trackpad is not react to any action (like double click). Right now this is just some plastic areaTurn off and turn on battery connector also didn't help me.The laptop did not receive any damage and was not flooded with water. Day or two before I got it from safe and checked my email then closed it and put to the safe again(hotel standard safe) (everything was okay but I didn't remember battery charge percent at that day) then I open and figured out that MacBook is dead.
