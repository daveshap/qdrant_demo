Does the VA hospital test potential employees for nicotine use?
Hi all! I was wondering if anyone out there knows if the VA hospital does a drug & nicotine screening during the physical? I’m a current smoker, and though I do intend to quit, I would like to be able to use a nicotine replacement for a week or two. My physical, however, is next week. The onboarding email mentions nothing about a drug test, but I’ve worked at a couple other hospitals that do test their potential employees for tobacco use. Thank you in advance!
