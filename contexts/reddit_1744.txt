Me using college decisions as a source of workout motivation:
If I get into a college,I’ll start working out regularly to get hot in time for college. 

If I don’t get into college, I won’t have to work out.

It’s a win-win situation

Edit: this is starting to gain heat so imma make it interesting for myself- if I get into college, I’ll add an extra second to my 17 minutes on the treadmill for every upvote. If I dont get in, I’ll eat an extra dorito for every upvote from a cheesy Doritos bag
