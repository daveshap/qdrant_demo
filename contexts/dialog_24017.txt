VIKTOR: You know you're really very good. I take back what I said. I mean, you're really good.
NICOLA: Thank you.
VIKTOR: You could play the lead.
NICOLA: But that's Simone's part.
VIKTOR: Yes, of course it is. You know you have a line here. Not a wrinkle. Actually, more of a dimple. I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
NICOLA: You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
VIKTOR: No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
