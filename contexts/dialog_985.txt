PARSONS: Everything on this module is locked and sealed. We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
HIROKO: How many... how many people are missing?
CASSIE: Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
HIROKO: What's our weapons situation?
DRISCOLL: Shit! Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores. We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
HIROKO: Auto-shop?
CASSIE: Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
HIROKO: Has anybody talked to them?
CASSIE: Not yet.
HIROKO: Do it.
