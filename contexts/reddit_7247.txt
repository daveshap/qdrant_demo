How can I become less thin-skinned?
Hi, I started a job recently working for a local government in a small town where everyone is really judgmental and combative, and hostile to outsiders. I relocated to take this position, and everyone in the local clique is mad I was hired over a particular local person (I'm more qualified). Since I'm a public servant I interface with the general public often, and they're usually coming to me to criticize or complain about how I'm doing my job. 

I'm not used to having to constantly defend myself. I get anxious and all of a sudden my brain shuts down and I can't articulate in a professional manner why I have made the particular choices I've made in this role. My mind goes blank. 

Is there a professional training where you constantly get ragged on and beat down that I can go through to get good at being attacked? Any suggestions are welcome.
