I've lost her. It's final. She's gone and I'm not ready.
I was falling asleep on the phone with my girlfriend. I've been having a shut day and my depersonalization kicked in earlier. She had already gone to sleep and I was slowly drifting off until I got a call. The name was "Papa". I immediately woke up. My heart fucking burst and before I even accepted the call I started bawling. I say hello and I hear his voice "Is your mom home? Can you bring her the phone I couldn't get ahold of her." I rush down the stairs unable to see from the tears and wake mom up and hand her the phone saying it's papa. She wakes up instantly and says "God please no" I start crying even harder. The first words my grandpa says is "Mom's going right now" at that I collapsed into the fetal position and lost it. 

I can't take this. This is more painful than anything I've experienced. The cutting, the pain I felt before attempting suicide in the past, the abuse. Nothing hurts more than losing 1 of the only two people who made me feel like I mattered. 

I'll miss you so godamn much grandma you were the only family I had. I just can't let myself be alone. I can't stop crying. This took me over 30 minutes to write.
