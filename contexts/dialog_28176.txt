DUNOIS: Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
JEANNE: Ah, so that's it. To you I'm just a girl.
DUNOIS: Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
JEANNE: Knowing what I know? Enormous gratitude.
