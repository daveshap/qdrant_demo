i hate the system and so on and so on
i bought into this idea of "good college=happiness" and now everything i do is connected to it. 90% of my conversations with my parents revolve around college admissions and my self worth is entirely dependent on grades. i never feel happy but instead just ride on a high after seeing my report card. everything i do out of kindness i try to think of ways to link it into my  "profile." every mildly interesting experience i have i try to think of ways in which it can be turned into some type of admission essay.

i hate all of this but my entire identity is dependent on this idea now, i don't have any hobbies, i just play video games, scroll through reddit and watch netflix.

what to do... what to do...
