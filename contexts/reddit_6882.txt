Help Please. What can I do to encourage a person not to give up when it comes to finding a job?
Help please. 

I'm trying to calm down a person in my family who was just recently let go from a job after a month. The reason why she was let go because of the coronavirus status. Which I don't think it was about the coronavirus. I think this issue was another employee who was jealous of the person in my family. I've been encouraging her not to give up to find a job. The person in my family put out so many resumes for a job. But, not a lot of people are calling back. I worry because the person in my family starts to get antsy. What can I do to encourage a person not to give up when it comes to finding a job?
