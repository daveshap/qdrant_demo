Looking for short story, prehistoric young man returning to tribe, giant bugs I\u2019m looking for a science fiction short story. My memory is a little hazy but I believe the story was about a prehistoric young man who was traveling to return to his tribe and had to deal with giant bugs and the like. May have included giant mushrooms etc. I think I read it in the 80s or 90s.
