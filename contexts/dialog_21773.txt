JOEY: I said, let's go.
SALVY: Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
JOEY: Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
SALVY: Excuse me for living.
JOEY: What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
SALVY: Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
