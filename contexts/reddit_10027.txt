Sexual Assault Response/Prevention Training
I'm on the hunt for suggestions for great sexual assault response and/or prevention presentations that can be geared towards RA/OL training.  I'm in the Boston area but welcome to ideas from all.

Have you used anything on your campus?  How did it go over?
Have you found anything creative and not just straight lecture/discussion?
