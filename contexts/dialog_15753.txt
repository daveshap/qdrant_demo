MUNRO: What a place for them...
HEYWARD: Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
MUNRO: Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out. Bloody murderers. You have three days.
HAWKEYE: A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
MUNRO: ...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
HEYWARD: Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
MUNRO: Webb's at Edward?
HEYWARD: Yes, sir.
MUNRO: Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow. Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
