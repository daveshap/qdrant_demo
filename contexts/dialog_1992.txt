ERIC: I need to rent a cabin.
KENAI: What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
ERIC: Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
KENAI: Pretty clever: If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look. They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip. Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town. I can't afford any trouble --
ERIC: -- Here's a hundred dollars. And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
KENAI: -- Forget it. And try not to bleed on my throw rugs. Why do this?
ERIC: If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand.
