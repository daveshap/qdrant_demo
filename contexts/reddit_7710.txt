How can I help a labmate give better presentations?
My fellow PhD student gives poor research talks. I feel some impetus to help him improve, but need to balance this with how much time and effort I use to help him.

I thoroughly enjoy giving talks, and since entering higher education, have been actively improving my abilities in this area, e.g., through asking for brutally honest feedback from an audience after a talk, reading books and literature on the matter, attending workshops (Alda Center for Communicating Science), and entering pitch competitions.

When my labmate gives a presentation, I know he knows the topic thoroughly and has great mastery of the science, but it is also clear he does not know his audience, what their background is, and what is an appropriate level of knowledge for them to possibly learn that day.  His slides are messy (black background, full of small text), and narrative hard to follow.

&#x200B;

Sometimes we are asked to give joint presentations to the same audience, or "split time" on a single talk. I have started to decline this requests, as I don't like trying to merge my talk with his.  This hurts me, as I truly love talking about my science. (I kinda feel bad about this.)

How much "authority" do I have to give him unsolicited advice on his presentations? In the Spring, I worked with him for hours on getting him to clearly understand his audience and make adjustments to slides for 1 talk. I don't have the time or energy to do this for all talks. We were tasked with giving a joint presentation later this Spring which I am already not looking forward to.

Any ideas or help you can give me in dealing with my fellow grad student, and improving my own attitude and actions, would be greatly appreciated.
