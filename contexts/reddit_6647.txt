Thank you message after getting ghosted by recruiter
I just want to ask how this thank you note to the recruiter sounds. I am assuming I will no longer be hired since I have not been responded to in a month on the result.

"I would just like to personally thank you for the opportunity to have been recruited and made it far in the application process in \[COMPANY\]. I look forward to potentially working with \[COMPANY\] in the future."
