I got a degree in Computer Science two years ago and realized the software industry culture isn't for me. How do I take the first step in changing direction?
After I graduated in 2017, I had a long, drawn out mental breakdown and realized in the middle of it that my career doesn't suit my temperament at all.

I absolutely cannot meet the expectation of showing up to work for 9-12 hours a day, staring at lines of code which mean nothing, only existing to make money for a company, and being locked away from the "natural" world. I simply don't have the interest, let alone the focus, to serve a company like that. My emotional well being can't handle it. This became especially clear after ending up in the hospital last summer in the middle of my breakdown. 

So I want to focus on what I find interesting and important, but also balance that with what keeps me centered emotionally. My personal interests are in biology and organic chemistry. I've considered finding a grad program that combines either of those with computed science, but I haven't taken any undergrad classes for what I think I want to do now.

If I did want to go to grad school, or even just get a degree in biology or chemistry, how would that even work? Would they require me to take undergrad classes first? I'd like to make my first degree mean at least something, but I also wouldn't mind abandoning it altogether if I felt I'd be happier. I should note I don't care about money really whatsoever. I'd just like enough to survive.

Thank you so much for any response! I just need anything to push me in the right direction. I need to survive but I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and miserable.
