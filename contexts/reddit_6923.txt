~50 year old, laid off recently.
My mom was laid off from her job in e-commerce fraud and she’s been having trouble getting interviews. Multiple people, including me, have looked at her resume and it looks fine. She’s worked for that company for ~20 years (she had other entry level jobs before this) and a bachelor’s degree that isn’t related to her field. Many of the jobs around require some coding experience, so she’s started to get acquainted with basics in SQL, but we’ll definitely need her to find a job soon. 

Any advice would be welcome.
