JEFF: What are you two talking about?
STELLA: Got a shovel?
JEFF: No.
STELLA: There's probably one in the basement.
JEFF: Now wait a minute --
LISA: Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
JEFF: Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
STELLA: You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
JEFF: There's no point in taking unnecessary chances. Give me the phone book, Lisa.
LISA: What for?
JEFF: Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
