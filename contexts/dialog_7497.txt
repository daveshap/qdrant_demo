HOLLY: Where are you going?
ELLIS: I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband. Hi there.
HOLLY: What are you going to do?
ELLIS: Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast. I can handle these clowns. I want to talk to Hans. Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
KARL: -- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
HANS: If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
KARL: I don't want neutral...I want dead --
ELLIS: Hope I'm not interrupting...?
HANS: What does he want?
