CONWAY: Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
GEORGE: Nothing about the porters yet?
CONWAY: Porters?
GEORGE: Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
CONWAY: Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
GEORGE: I'm afraid the porters are just a myth. I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
CONWAY: Shhh!
BARNARD: Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
CONWAY: Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
