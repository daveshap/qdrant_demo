I need relationship advice
So like me and this chick (we’re friends btw) agreed to be Valentines but I meant it as friends and she meant it as the fact that we were now dating but our relationship is long distance and I want a relationship that is physical, you know? And like my other friend told me to break it to her in the nicest way possible but like I fall short when it comes to being nice and now I don’t know what to do
