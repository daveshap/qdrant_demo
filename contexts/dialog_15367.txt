FRANK: Take it easy. Both of you.
ANDY: I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
PETER: What's that supposed to mean?
ANDY: It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
PETER: That's crazy! Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
ANDY: You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
PETER: He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven. Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
ANDY: Oh, we'll be back. You can bet on it.
