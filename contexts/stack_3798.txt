5-way significant interaction with mixed-ANOVA, how to interpret!? (SPSS) I am analysing results from a study which was a 2 (stimulus type) x 2 (distance) x 2 (speed) x 2 (cardiac cycle) x 2 (grouping variable-between subjects) mixed ANOVA, all of the factors have 2 levels and only one of them is a between subjects measure, the rest are within. I have a significant interaction between them all. I am unsure how to interpret it or how to find out where the interaction came from.I have split the data with the between-factor and that again had some significant results.group 1= stimulus * distance * speed * Cardiac group 2 = speed * stimulus , stimuli *distance * speed * cardiac, and distance * speed * cardiac. I can't further split the file into Cardiac cycle, I think because the data is in a wide format and the cardiac cycle is spreed across a few columns and this is the case for speed, distance and stimulus too. There seems to be nothing online or in books about 5-way ANOVAS!!!!Any help and advice greatly appreciated.Thanks,
