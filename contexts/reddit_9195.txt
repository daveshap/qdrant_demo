Is there a name to the high cost of being poor?
There are many examples that show that being poor costs money.  An example would be that a poor person does not always have the possibility of buying products in bulk (which usually saves money) - which means he spends more money on the same stuff. Another example is ensuring his car in a rough neighborhood which usually costs more.  


Is there a standard name for the phenomena?  


I googled but did not find any mention of a unified name. I also did not find a site on StackExchange where I felt a question like this belongs. So I thought this is a place I can ask.  


Thanks.
