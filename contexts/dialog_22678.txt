IKE: My magazine doesn't pay because for stories. It's not what you call ethical.
MAGGIE: Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical? Actually, I meant you. You probably got severance or expenses or both. I'll take your check. No credit cards.
IKE: You've seen the post-its. I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
MAGGIE: Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
IKE: Too much.
MAGGIE: Seven-fifty.
IKE: Five hundred.
MAGGIE: Six-fifty.
IKE: Done.
