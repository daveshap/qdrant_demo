What are your “yellow flags” when it comes to dating?
Yellow flags as in no imminent danger or anything overtly alarming, but still indicators of something not great.

Mine is grown men sending me sad faces if I haven’t replied or if I am otherwise taking a long time to answer (I’m a 22 year old woman and have had men in their forties do this when I wasn’t interested in talking to them). To me it looks childish and manipulative, and is a turnoff almost instantly. 

How about you?
