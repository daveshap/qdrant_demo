How to fill an airtight box with a gas? Any idea how I can fill a standard, airtight plastic storage box (45 litres) with Argon? The naive solution would probably to \"pour\" Argon into the box since it is heavier than air, but there must be a better way. Maybe punch two holes into the lid and place a valve in each one? If so, how would I install these valves without compromising the air-tightness of the box?Any ideas are greatly appreciated. Also, please move my question to another board if this is not the right board; however, I couldn't find a better fit.Edit: Follow-up-questions: IIRC winegrowers use candles to determine whether there is enough oxygen available to breathe in their cellars. What if I put an open box in a cellar deprived of oxygen, leave it there for a day and then put a lid on? Can I expect the box to be filled mostly with CO or CO2 or whatever is down there?Edit 2: Consensus seems to favour the vacuum bag solution. Thank you for all the great answers so far!
