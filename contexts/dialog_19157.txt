WAYNE: So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview. You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
SCOTT: When do you want the assembly?
WAYNE: Tomorrow.
