PRIS: We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
SEBASTIAN: We sure did.
PRIS: I'm hungry, J.F.
SEBASTIAN: I've got stuff. If you wanna go to my place?
PRIS: I was hoping you'd say that.
DECKARD: Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass. Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill. I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me. Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image. If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
ESPER: This is Esper and I'm ready. Go ahead please.
DECKARD: You equipped for random questions?
ESPER: Why, yes, of course.
DECKARD: You start.
ESPER: The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program. Are you with me?
DECKARD: How do I stop one?
ESPER: Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another. Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
DECKARD: Okay, but...
ESPER: I'm coming to that. Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone. A direct hit is a positive retirement.
