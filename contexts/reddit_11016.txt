Hey Jake
Yes, that’s you, Jake.
                                                                                                 I am your sister, and you are screaming at  Fortnite at eight AM, and I know you browse this sub. Shut the freak up.
                                                                                         Also, since you are screaming about your other “loser” friends not having a girlfriend, while you also don’t have one either, I feel like I need to address this point too. You always complain about not having a girlfriend, while spending all your time on Fortnite. Girls actually need attention, more attention than Fortnite.
                                                                                Anyways, sorry for the rant to everyone besides Jake,  but Jake, stop and shut up.
