Path of exile - party tanker build Due to my group having too many aggressive builds, I thought it might help if I instead use a more tanky build that can withstand damage and draw the enemies to me and let them focus on dealing damage. But I am facing a few problems:Bosses seems to be immune to taunting, in fact they seemed to attack those that deals more damage resulting in my character being mostly ignored by bosses.Potion recharge by killing, my character lacks damage and therefore unable to charge back potions needed.Evasion tanking is not reliable at all, regardless which base character I attempt it ends up focusing on armour/energy shield instead.I have searched around for suggested Tank builds but those builds focus on being able to survive while hitting the boss and not what I have in mind.Is there any way to build a tanker that can effectively draw attacks(especially from bosses) to let the damage dealers of the party focus more on doing damage?
