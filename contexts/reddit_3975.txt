I did it
I finally managed to ask my crush out. And she revealed to me she got a boyfriend. I took it rather well and kept my cool during the whole thing.

While I am disappointed a little that my crush loves someone else, I'm proud of myself for finally getting the balls to at least ask. Proud that I finally told my crush how I felt after two years. Proud that now that I've asked a girl out for the first time, then what's gonna stop me from asking out someone else? 

I'm so proud of myself for finally saying something. It goes to show that if a socially awkward guy like me can do it, so can you! 

Thank you guys for listening.
