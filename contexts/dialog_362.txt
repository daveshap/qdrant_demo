MRS MATHEWS: Yes... ?
WELLES: Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
WELLES: I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit. If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
MRS MATHEWS: I don't understand, who are... ?
WELLES: I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington. I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
MRS MATHEWS: Yes, but...
WELLES: These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations... ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different. I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually. I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh...
WELLES: What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
MRS MATHEWS: Neil... Neil Cole.
WELLES: Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me. He didn't call?
MRS MATHEWS: No.
WELLES: Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair. Born April 24, 1976. Missing June 11th, 1992. A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
