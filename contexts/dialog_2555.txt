PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
MARTY: But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: My guess is that she turned him down.
MARTY: But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
MARTY: Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
MARTY: Jesus!
