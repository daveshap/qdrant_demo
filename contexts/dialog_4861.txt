TOM: Uh-huh.
JANE: I agree with you -- you're not qualified. So get qualified. You can insist on being better prepared. You don't have to just leave it as... 'I don't write. I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
TOM: Whoa, this was a mistake.
JANE: Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake? Stop whining and do something about it.
