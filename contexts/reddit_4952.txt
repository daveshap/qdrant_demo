I can’t describe what i felt anymore
It will be 2months already since she broke up with me. I already give up to the thoughts that we will be back from each other cause it’s really impossible. She’s already happy with her someone new. For me I already accept it and it’s good to know that she’s happy already. But its still hurt a lot to the point that there’s no more tears to cry. My chest is feeling numb to the pain that I’m feeling. My emotions is like a roller coaster right now I’m feeling hurt later. I feel empty sad and later on i feel nothing no emotion. I don’t know at what point of life is me right now
