People try to talk you out of suicide instead of talking you into life
That's the pattern every time. Someone will try and explain why I shouldn't just kill myself but they never give me any good reasons why living is preferable to me dying.

Death is a perament solution to a temporary problem? No other solution is permanent, anything could go wrong at any time, suicide is a permanent solution to all my problems and is therefore the best one I have.
