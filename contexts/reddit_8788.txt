A Quality Conservative Podcast?
Can someone direct me to an intelligent, conservative podcast?  I perused the prior podcast threads but most seem to suggest the left-of-center tracks I already listen to.


I tend to support progressive politics and the media I consume bears this out. The podcasts I currently listen to strive to be either neutral (fivethirtyeight.com Election Pod), left of center (Keepin' It 1600, The New York Times Politics Pod, The Skepticrats), or "alien"(Dan Carlin's Common Sense). However, I wonder if part of the reason politics has run so hard to the wings in recent years is because we have failed to listen to each other. We stay in our own echo chambers. I want to listen to the other side because it helps me sharpen my own argument, but I might also find a genuinely good idea from time to time.  I believe it lies within the core values of this subreddit to try to understand opposing views as well as our own.


I want a podcast with good logic for conservative viewpoints. A sense of humor wouldn't hurt. Anyone who relies on demagoguery and anger, empty sentiment, or tries to argue their points with theology is a complete non-starter for me.
