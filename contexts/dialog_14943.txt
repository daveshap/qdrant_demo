AMANDA: Eric!
GRANT: Quiet!
PAUL: Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
AMANDA: Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
PAUL: No, Dr. Grant says...
AMANDA: Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
PAUL: Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
AMANDA: Because Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast."
PAUL: Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.
AMANDA: Oh, don't worry about that.
PAUL: What?
AMANDA: Nothing.
PAUL: What did you say?
AMANDA: Nothing.
PAUL: What did you say!
AMANDA: Just drop it Paul!
