LEDUC: Merde... Wait here. When I return you tell me about last night, huh?
ANDY: But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
LEDUC: I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
AMY: Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
ANDY: Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
