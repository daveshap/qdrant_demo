EPPS: And you know what that area is? It's Iraq. IRAQ! We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm. Maybe you've read about it.
JAEGER: What we're doing is kicking ass. For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews. The war is over. We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
WES: You're not saying what I think you're saying. I can't believe you're even thinking it.
JAEGER: It's right here. This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos. There're no troops there, no fighting--
WES: You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to. And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
JAEGER: It's about a hundred miles from where we are now. How long do you think it would take us to--
WES: It's not a hundred miles. It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain: Pure desert, mountains, a river. If the map is even real.
JAEGER: It's real. I'm telling you, it's real.
WES: So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase? It's crazy. Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
