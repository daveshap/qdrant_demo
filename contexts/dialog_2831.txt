HARDY: I didn't shoot West...
OSBORNE: What?
HARDY: Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
DUNBAR: I apologize --
HARDY: You saw West's body.
DUNBAR: Of course --
OSBORNE: Where?
DUNBAR: The creek bed --
HARDY: And he'd been shot.
DUNBAR: Yeah --
OSBORNE: What about the phosphorous grenade?
DUNBAR: One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
