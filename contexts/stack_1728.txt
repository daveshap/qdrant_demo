How to get ip address Schneider PLC controller TM218LDAE40DRPHN? I am new to PLC technology and I am doing the following step, listed below:Connect from PLC to retrieve data through Ethernet using Modbus TCP/IP.  I found that PLC didn't have its IP address listed on it (do PLCs usually have their IP address on it?) but I do have a MAC address: xxxxxx. Then I read some documentation:   <blockquote>  The default IP address is based on the device\u2019s MAC address. The first two bytes are 10 and 10. The last two bytes are the last two bytes of the device\u2019s MAC  address.      The default subnet mask is 255.0.0.0.    NOTE: A MAC address is always written in hexadecimal format, and an IP address  in decimal format. You must convert the MAC address to decimal format.      Example: If the MAC address is xx.xx.xx.xx.xx.xx, the default IP address is  10.10.128.242,</blockquote>So I tried to convert the last two MAC address. Here I got 10.10.161.157, and when I try to ping it it doesn't work.Any suggestion would be nice, thank you.
