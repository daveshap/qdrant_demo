LAZARUS: Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
ELLA MAE: These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
LAZARUS: For your hands?
ELLA MAE: Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin. This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
LAZARUS: I'll take a jar of that, too.
