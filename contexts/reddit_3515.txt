Girls go through the same struggles as us, right?
I don't mean this in a rude way, I'm just drunk af and want to speak my mind.

Sometimes I have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that girls get ghosted, rejected and the same as us, due to the disproportoniate amounts of attention gotten on dating apps.

As I struggle to find a partner and feel hopeless, I struggle to feel that ladies feel the same way.

Can some ladies of this sub set me straight?
