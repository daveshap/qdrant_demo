Y’all hype people up TOO much on this thread
I’m seeing people tell others with a 3.6 UW and 1300 SAT  (and some dumb ECs like French club that they aren’t even leader in) that they have a chance at UCLA or Cal. Y’all are gonna devastate these poor people who think they had a good chance at the school when they get rejected from all the UCs.
