I won a teaching award!!
For the last year or so I've been teaching a physical chemistry discussion section, and I really put my all into it. I care about those kids, and I tried my best to help them, because a lot of them were struggling with the main class because it was hard as hell. I designed worksheets, I met with them outside of class to work through problems one on one, and I really tried to show them that they could do it. 

I guess someone noticed, and I won a teaching award for last year! Ah I'm so happy!!!

Edit: I hope this doesn't come off as braggy, I just don't know where else to share this and I'm bursting with excitement lol
