Which jobs allow extreme flexibility, good pay, and very little work?
Before I get any preachy comments like "get your head out of your ass, everyone has to work hard to make $$$." It's simply not true. I'll give you examples:

My brother is a stunt man in the movie industry. He just fell into it because of his look. No prior training. He works on average 2 months out of the entire year. Most of his stunt jobs are either very easy (some actors need a stunt double even just to run), or very safe (things that look dangerous in the movies are actually very controlled). He says he  shouldn't get paid the amount he does for the work. He makes well over 6 figures, when you include the steady royalties checks he gets monthly.

Next up. Owners of parking lots in congested areas. My friend's father does it. He has 4 lots downtown. He makes over a million a year. He golfs every day.

Alright. Hopefully commentors can add to this list. Thanks
