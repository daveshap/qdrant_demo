What practical use would turning Herschel crater (Mimas) into a massive satellite dish have? Saturn and it's moons, minus a few rogue colonies, are under the control of the Saturnine Syndicate. Long have they wanted to turn Mimas into a communication, technology, and data hub. But I've run into a problem: I don't honestly know if a massive satellite dish on Mimas (taking up the Hetrschels crater) would have any use.My question is: Is there any practical use for a large satellite dish on Mimas? Or would it be better to not use a massive satellite dish, another location is better, etc.Note: Yes, Mimas would really look like the Death Star with this satellite dish. Which would be a funny reference in my mind.
