How to install Java 7 or jkd 7 on Ubuntu 16.04? I'm really in trouble. As the Java 7 support and built are not available anymore on the web. I have gone through many of resources and question answering websites online but unable to resolve this issue.I'm a non-technical person and recently have installed the Ubuntu 16.04. I want to unzip the files of my data backup. The size of files is 60 GB and 80 GB. The default archive manager in Ubuntu is unable to unzip the files or I am using the wrong method to do that.Can anyone please help me in this case?
