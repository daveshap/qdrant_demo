FORD: What an interface!
JAZZ: Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
FORD: Yeah, Colleen mentioned it. What do they make?
JAZZ: C.D.s. The music kind. From the Grendel label.
FORD: Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s. Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
JAZZ: But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
