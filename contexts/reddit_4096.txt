IM GONNA TELL MY CRUSH I LIKE HIM THIS FRIDAY
Im (15F) gonna tell my crush, who is also my best friend, that I like him. I’m extremely nervous. I’ve never told anyone I’ve liked them before. But I feel like the time is right, and I really want to do it and get some closure.

Im gonna write a little confession on a piece of paper, which I’m gonna fold into a paper crane. Then on Friday, I’m gonna give him the paper crane as we part ways, and tell him to unfold it after school.

Ahhhh. I’m so scared, but I’m so excited at the same time. I’m trying not to get my hopes up though, just in case. But nonetheless, I still can’t believe I’m actually gonna do it!!!!!!

Edit: I posted an update on how it went!
