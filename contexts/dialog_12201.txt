BURROWS: Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
MAST: You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
BURROWS: I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway. Do you really think he's in danger?
MAST: If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
BURROWS: We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
MAST: Big threat. TV would ream you.
BURROWS: Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you.
