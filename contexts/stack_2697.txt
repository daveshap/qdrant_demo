Point cloud/image comparison? I used MATLAB software to classify point cloud data into 3 classes; (1) main; (2) protrusion and (3) recess. In MATLAB I assigned a distinctive color to each class to differentiate between classes (yellow, red and blue; but black is not among classification color and it is only background color which is the places which no point exist and therefore, no class was assigned). When the classified point cloud displayed, I took a screen shot of it (TIFF images attached). I wish if I could attach point clouds (txt format), but apparently it is not possible. In my MATLAB code, there are several parameters to adjust to get the optimum classification results (presented in three colors in reference image and reference point cloud). If I change those parameters from optimum values to other values, then the classification results are changed.Now, if I assume the reference figure (or reference point cloud) is the base for comparison, I need to calculate how much accurate the other three figures have been classified? For example, if I say %30 of whole reference image is in red (openings), then how much is this red percentage in any of the other three figures? Similarly for blue and yellow color percentage. This percentage or any other quantitative comparison. I have been trying to find out a way to compare the accuracy of classification either using MATLAB or ARC GIS/MAPS, ENVI or any other tools, but so far no luck.
