Mom said she’s disappointed with my results
My (Asian) mom has always wanted me to go to an Ivy. A few days before ivy day, I told her she shouldn’t be expecting ANY ivy acceptances and she got mad and told me that I should at least get into cornell and said I wasn’t good enough for HYP. I got into Penn, Cornell, and Brown, so I thought I had satisfied her. I asked her today if she was happy and she told me she was disappointed that I didn’t get into Princeton or Harvard. I can’t take this shit anymore. She’s a good parent but she needs to lay off with this HYP stuff. She doesn’t understand what exactly it takes to get into those schools and that my high school does not have a good rep with one of the HYP after a student was expelled for academic reasons. Sometimes I really hate how Asian people worship this prestige stuff and it makes me question whether or not I should even go to penn. 

Edit: wow I did not expect to get this much support, thanks to everyone. But also some of u people don’t need to brutally bash my mom she’s not that terrible, her mindset is just a little flawed
