Feeling Lost. 33 years old, is it too late?
Hey everyone.  Lately I have been on unemployment and I have to say it has really drained my motivation.  Ive fallen into a slump right after getting my Masters degree, partly because after applying widely I have had no luck.   


I spent the last year driving for uber and I found that it was good soul searching experience.  I found out 2 things about myself.    


1.  I love motivating and inspiring others.  The best times I had as a driver were when I was able to motivate an inspire younger underprivlages high school kids.  Weather that's talking about college, or encouraging them to deliver pizza instead of dope.  It really made me feel good and  I was good at it.    


2. Theres nothing like working for yourself.  I ended up putting a lot more hours into work because I was not working for anyone else.    


So my masters degree is in health science.  I wish I could get into a counciling or therapist role with that, but I can not.  Also, I do not have an undergrad degree.. I went to grad school in my jr. year.  Also.. my masters is from a Caribbean school.  So far nobody has given me any grief about where it is from, but I do think I will run into problems applying for masters programs here in the US. 

I would love to be a psychologist.. but I feel like I might be too late.  Im really good at fixing things, I have really good clinical knowledge and knowledge of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology and other medicine related subjects.  I have good computer skills, good leadership skills, good customer service skills, good math skills and can be extremely hard working.  


I live in Seattle right now and while on unemployment I have been spending my time teaching myself SQL.  Its slow going, and I don't even know if I can get a job afterwards.  The other Idea I have is to use my uber income and save up and get a food truck.  Seattle has a big hole for late night food.  hope u have a good day, thanks.
