Best way to connect 7 x 18650 Panasonic batteries to 2 LEDs Looking for some help with correct wiring: I have created a custom 7-cell battery (4 cell block in parallel, 3 cell block in parallel and both blocks connected via series) to produce a 7.4V 23.8A battery set/unit. At a basic level, I need to connect the battery directly to an LED array (parallel) which requires 9V @ 800mA or 9V @ 1.6A (constant current). Since the battery has an output of only 7.4V I need a booster, I know. I also know that I can get a DROK CC booster from Amazon that is configurable. However, I do not have the space to house these larger prefabricated PCBs. I need only the critical components to squeeze into a 2\" space and get a working proto. Could someone please provide the correct parts to purchase from Digikey or Mouser (or where else) and make this work? I am also open to any other suggestions in configuring the battery. Then there is charging! I wanted to use a CC power adapter that would pump 7.5V at 1.6A. Will this charge the complete 7 cell battery unit or would I need to reduce that to the each cell level of 4.2V @ 1C? Appreciate any feedback. Thanks
