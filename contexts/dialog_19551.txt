NANCY: What's with the bars?
MARGE: S'curity.
NANCY: Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
MARGE: Dead and gone.
NANCY: I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
MARGE: Your father the cop. That's a good one. Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
NANCY: I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
