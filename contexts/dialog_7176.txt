RHODES: You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
MARY: Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
MARY: You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
RHODES: And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
MARY: Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
RHODES: Oh, I have no doubt.
MARY: If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
RHODES: Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
MARY: Rhodes, you and I had a roll in the hay together when I first got here. It was a wholly unsatisfying experience which I do not want to, and which I never will repeat! So give up, mister! I'm going home...to that roommate you mentioned.
