Does a Postdoc have to be in the same field as your PhD?
Not suggesting a wild change from history to physics or anything like that - but say your PhD is in linguistics, could you hypothetically have a postdoc in literature? Or is it a very strict path and you have no real hope if it doesn't follow on exactly from your PhD work?
