PETER: Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
ELLIE: Seems to me I've already thanked you for that. What time is the next bus to New York?
GUARD: Eight o'clock tonight.
ELLIE: Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
GUARD: Sorry, Miss.
PETER: What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you? Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
ELLIE: What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
