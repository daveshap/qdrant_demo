I'm drowning in guilt.
The man that saved my life is dying in the hospital right now. That hospital is a five minute drive from where I live. I could walk there in twenty. 

It's fear that keeps me away.
It's the breathtaking panic I felt in that ICU on Sunday that will keep me from coming back.

Where you lay right now, that's the ICU that I almost died in 2 yrs ago.
I probably would have died in the garage if you hadn't found me unresponsive and not breathing on the ground.
If you hadn't started chest compressions and called 911.

I went to that hospital the day you got there, Sunday. I tried to stay, but fight or flight took over. I held your hand if only for a moment. 
I swear I could feel the box in my chest trying to slow my heart rate. I panicked, I told my wife that I had to leave
"Now?" I heard her ask as I quickly headed back from where we came. 

I couldn't breathe. The smell had brought back so much and I couldn't handle anymore.  I got outside and I knew that'd be the last time I would see you. 

I'm too fucking scared to go back.

I feel like I'm drowning in guilt and anxiety and I fucking hate it. That's what's bothering me.
