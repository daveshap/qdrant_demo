European style of dating: They don't "date". They hang out and see what happens.
I'm probably being too broad when I say "european". When I first heard there was not a strong tradition "dating" over there (specifically France) I wondered what that meant. I was told by a friend that it simply meant you hung out with people with no preconditions or assumptions. Then if the mood and timing was right, you acted on it.

I have dated over the past year. For the most part I've avoided putting any real effort into dating for about 4 months now. This "euro style" came to mind because I think I have accidently found myself doing that. Let me draw some comparisons.

**Example 1**

I did go on a "date" with someone about a month ago. We met through a dating site. 

* This means we were both trying to process each other.
* Understand if we could be partners.
* We probably had our mind on the potential of romance, overlooking the potential for friendship.
* We probably both wondered IF sex was a possibility.

Under that setup there's a lot of pressure and it didn't work out. It was a date and so I only analyzed it from that perspective and I imagine she did to some extent as well.

**Example 2**

**Here's an example of another recent situation.** I asked out a coworker with very honest intentions: I wanted to socialize and make friends.

* I thought she was cute but I was not necessarily super attracted to her but I didn't care because I wasn't trying to "date" her.
* I didn't entirely care whether she liked me too much. I just wanted a friend at work and meet a new person.
* Eventually when her and I hung out at a bar, I did not necessarily consider it a date. She didn't either. I didn't really have strong interest in her at the time. 
* However as the months passed... we've both realized we really enjoy each other's company more than we expected. There's a lot of flirtation and tension there. It's fun.

What made Example 2 so interesting is that I was never focused on asking myself if she sees me as a romantic partner. It allowed us to just take our time and get to know each other.

**Does anyone else prefer this non-dating approach? It seems more sensible to me. It seems more patient.**
