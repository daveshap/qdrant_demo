SONNY: Is he all right? Is he all right?
MORETTI: He's all doped up.
SONNY: I want to talk to him.
MORETTI: He's groggy, Sonny. Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back.
MORETTI: Leon? Whatsa matter? They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
LEON: Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
MORETTI: Well, you got to get hold of yourself. You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
LEON: Oh no!
MORETTI: He's got eight people in there with him. He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
LEON: I can't help it. I can't stop him from anything.
MORETTI: If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
LEON: He won't listen to anybody. He's been very crazy all summer. Since June he's been trying to kill me.
MORETTI: You try calling the police?
LEON: What good is that? They couldn't stop him. And it'd just make him mad. They don't know him.
MORETTI: Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
LEON: He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
MORETTI: He's makin' threats in there.
LEON: He's scared. It's crazy. I never met anyone like him. His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children. His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable. I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already! But he did it. I don't know why. I thought it would help me, but it didn't. I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
MORETTI: What kind of things, Leon?
LEON: Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with. I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body. So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that? 2500 dollars! My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
MORETTI: He needed money? For the operation for you?
LEON: It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages. And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation. So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital. Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!' So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
MORETTI: Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
LEON: I can't talk to him.
MORETTI: You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory. You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
LEON: I'm afraid.
MORETTI: How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
LEON: I don't know what to say to him. I can't.
MORETTI: You think it over, Leon.
