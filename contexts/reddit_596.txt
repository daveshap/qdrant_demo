My ex's best friend
(17/F) Soo I'm friends with a group of guys, we're classmates. I talk to them almost every evening on discord, and we play together. About a year ago I had a crush on one of them, but nothing happened (although he was probably into me, too). After I'd moved on (or at least I tought I had) I dated his best friend for 4 days, but then I realized I didn't have any feelings for him, so I broke up with him. Since, he's said that he was over me, and we're still good friends. Now everything is the same between us. We're a month later in the present and I've fallen in love with the first guy again. I had no idea what to do. One evening he was left alone with me on discord. We were talking about our lovelives and how we were both really unlucky. I said if neather of us would succeed, let's go on a date. He said not that he wouldn't want to, but he wouldn't date his best friend's ex. Do you think his opinion could change? Or that with this hint I planted a thought in his head, that could bloom into something in the future?
