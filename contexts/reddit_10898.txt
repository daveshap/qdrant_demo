Is it possible that I'm just too lazy for life?
That's it. I feel I'm just too lazy for life. I have lost motivation and interest in everything. I'm not looking forward for future at all and I don't enjoy living.

I don't know what is so wrong with me. I force myself to do things I have to do, exercise on regular basis, although all I want to do is just sleep or lock myself in a room without seeing anyone. But even I force myself, motivation still doesn't come. It's like I have lost interest in life.

I'm very tired of putting on a mask to hide how disfunctional I actually am. I need to constantly pretend that I care and I'm interested in everything, or that I'm present while I'm doing something when my mind just can't stop imagining about death every single moment. 

I don't think I will be able to do suicide because my parents would be too traumatized by it, but I honestly don't know how long I can keep going and I welcome death, or if there was a dangerous situation that could lead me to death, I probably won't escape.

It's like I'm existing but I'm already dead. I feel so inhuman.
