Would you put a course which has no degree on your curriculum?
I am not an english speaker, I actually speak portuguese as native language. 

As I am confined inside my house, I looked for a course to take, and I found one about Logical and Critical thinking, that is very interesting and useful for making decisions, which has a duration of 4 hours a week (a total of 8 weeks to finish it, with 32 hours being the total duration) 

Although, the printed degree will only be available for the ones who have paid for premium access. 

The course is brought by the University of Oakland (New Zealand) 

Can I put it on my curriculum? Or it's better to let it out? 

Apologies for my english, as I've said, it's not my mother-language. Have a nice day you all!
