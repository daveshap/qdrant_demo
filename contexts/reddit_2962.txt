How do I apply for new jobs when I already work 10 hour days?
When I get out of the office I need to run errands, cook, clean, be in bed by 10:30. I’m suffocating here and there is no energy left to apply for jobs, I feel like I’m trapped. I just want my life back.

Edit: Honesty, I just want out ASAP. Which places hire quickly? I’m on the verge of tears from the stress.
