DEBI: Flowers. That's funny.
MARTIN: As long as I get the laugh.
DEBI: Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
MARTIN: You look beautiful.
DEBI: Okay... Hold on...
DEBI: ...Let me get my coat.
MARTIN: I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
MARTIN: Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
MR. NEWBERRY: Good evening, Mr. Blank.
MARTIN: How are you? How's business?
MR. NEWBERRY: Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
MARTIN: How's that?
MR. NEWBERRY: I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
MARTIN: I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
MR. NEWBERRY: Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
MARTIN: Why not?
MR. NEWBERRY: So what are you doing with your life now, son?
MARTIN: I'm a professional killer.
MR. NEWBERRY: That's good.
