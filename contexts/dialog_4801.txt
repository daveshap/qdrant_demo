LARRY: Oh no!--I just remembered.
FRANK: What?
LARRY: I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
FRANK: I'm not hungry.
LARRY: Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
FRANK: I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
LARRY: Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on.
