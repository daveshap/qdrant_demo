1N5822 schottky diode heatsinking Is the cathode for schottky diode hotter than the anode, as is common for most diodes, or is it reverse polarity? A schottky is a metal-semiconductor junction, with the metal at the anode. So it should be better for heatsinking, even if the cathode is actually larger, right (i.e. reverse polarity in package nomenclature)?I'm specifically interested in the 1N5819 and 1N5822 leaded DO-41 and DO201 package.
