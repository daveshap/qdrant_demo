SALIERI: Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
JOSEPH: I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
SALIERI: An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
JOSEPH: Yes?
SALIERI: You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
JOSEPH: And the result satisfies.
SALIERI: Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
JOSEPH: Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
SALIERI: I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
JOSEPH: You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
SALIERI: Sire.
JOSEPH: Well. There it is.
MOZART: What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
VON STRACK: What is what?
MOZART: Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
VON STRACK: Because His Majesty wishes it.
MOZART: Is the Emperor angry with me?
VON STRACK: On the contrary.
MOZART: Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
VON STRACK: Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
MOZART: No, but I'm the best.
VON STRACK: A little modesty would suit you better.
MOZART: Who is on this committee?
VON STRACK: Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
MOZART: Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
VON STRACK: Mozart -
MOZART: They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
VON STRACK: Mozart -
MOZART: Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
VON STRACK: Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
MOZART: Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
CONSTANZE: I think you're mad! You're really mad!
MOZART: Oh, leave me alone.
CONSTANZE: One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
MOZART: They'll come anyway. They love me here.
CONSTANZE: No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
MOZART: Oh yes? You always know everything.
CONSTANZE: Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
MOZART: You borrowed money from your mother?
CONSTANZE: Yes!
MOZART: Well, don't do that again!
CONSTANZE: How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
MOZART: Don't be stupid.
CONSTANZE: All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
MOZART: Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
CONSTANZE: This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
