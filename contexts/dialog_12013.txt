HANNAH: I hope you tell her it was your idea...
LEE: Why?
HANNAH: ...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
LEE: Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
HANNAH: So how are you?
LEE: Oh, me, I'm okay.
HANNAH: Do you miss Frederick?
LEE: No.
HANNAH: I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
LEE: How are you?
HANNAH: I'm okay.
LEE: You know, how's everything? You doing okay? How's Frederick? I mean, Elliot.
HANNAH: Y-yeah.
HANNAH: Oh, he's fine. He's-he's, I guess he's fine. I don't know. He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
LEE: Really?
HANNAH: Yeah. I-I don't know what's wrong with him. He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
LEE: Oh...
HANNAH: I've been trying to talk to him about it. He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
LEE: Like what?
HANNAH: I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
LEE: Oh, no! I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
HANNAH: Hey, hi!
HOLLY: Well, I just came from an audition...
LEE: Hi.
HOLLY: ...which I did not get.
HANNAH: Awwww...
HOLLY: So what's new?
HANNAH: Boy--
HOLLY: They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
HANNAH: Oh, what do they know?
HOLLY: Thanks. But guess who was there auditioning?
LEE: April?
HANNAH: Oh, gosh.
HOLLY: You got it.
