HANS: You're very perceptive.
ELLIS: Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something. Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business. I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
HANS: You're amazing. You figured this all out already?
ELLIS: Hey, business is business. You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference? To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building. Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
HANS: I must have missed 60 Minutes. What are you saying?
ELLIS: The guy upstairs who's fucking things up? I can give him to you.
