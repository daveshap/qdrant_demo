LT. ZOGG: King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
MAJOR KONG: I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
LT. ZOGG: Thanks, King. I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
MAJOR KONG: Listen, Lothar. You know that crack I made about your...butt?
LT. ZOGG: Forget it.
MAJOR KONG: I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
LT. ZOGG: Sure, King.
MAJOR KONG: Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay. And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
