CAESAR: What?
VIOLET: You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
CAESAR: Holy shit, I don't believe it! We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
VIOLET: Good boy.
CAESAR: It's Gino! It's Gino!
MICKEY: Where in the hell is he?
VIOLET: We were in a car accident --
CAESAR: They were in a car accident.
VIOLET: But everybody is all right.
CAESAR: They're all fine. Just bruises and shit.
VIOLET: Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ...
MICKEY: Un-fucking-believable. I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
CAESAR: Ssh! I can't hear Gino!
VIOLET: We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
CAESAR: I'm listening.
VIOLET: I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies. No one. Say yes, I understand.
CAESAR: Yes, I understand.
VIOLET: Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
CAESAR: Sure, Gino, sure.
