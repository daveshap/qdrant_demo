ADELE: My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
CARRIE: What's Early been in jail for?
ADELE: Carryin' a gun.
CARRIE: ...Anything else?
ADELE: An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
CARRIE: Jeez... Adele!
