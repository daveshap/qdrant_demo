Firefox Quantum installed but doesn't see internal or external storage drives I recently installed Ubuntu 18.04 on my home desktop and went to upgrade my copy of Firefox to the new Quantum version. My computer is set up with two internal hard drives; and SSD for the OS and a 1tb WD hard drive for storage. The 'old' version of Firefox could see or navigate to the internal storage drive... the Quantum version can't see/find that drive OR any external drives attached to my computer. Google Chrome has no issues with the internal drive, and I don't think the drive is at fault since Chrome can find and save to it, and the old version of Firefox (now re-installed) can find and save to the internal drive... so what's going on with Firefox Quantum?<br><br>Mount at system startup is checked<br>Show in use interface is checked<br>Require additional authorization is NOT checked<br>NO Display Name<br>NO Icon Name<br>NO Symbolic Icon Name<br>unamed field has these properties: nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show<br>Mount Point = /mnt/Storage_Disc_01<br>Identify As = /dev/disk/by-label/Storage_Disc_01<br>Fiesystem Type = auto<br>What am I doing wrong, or can Firefox Quantum only see the drive it's installed on?
