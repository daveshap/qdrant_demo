Can an electrostatic field itself be insulated, as opposed to creating resistance to a current? Is it possible to insulate an electrostatic field itself, as opposed to preventing electrons from moving by creating resistance?Specifically, if we position an isolated charge on one side of a resistant barrier that the charge itself cannot penetrate, and we have an electrostatic field on the other side of the barrier, will the electrostatic field act on the charge? Here is a crude diagram, where q is the charge:q |:::::::| fieldI believe an answer to this question will have two parts:(1) Will the charge move towards the barrier and then stop, exerting a force on the barrier? Or will the charge simply be stationary because there is no field on the other side of the barrier?The key distinction being that in one case, the barrier prevents the field itself from reaching the charge; in the other, the barrier simply prevents the electron from moving through it.(2) Is there a type of barrier (i.e., a substance of some kind) that is thought to be capable of \"blocking\or diminishing, the force of an electrostatic field itself, as opposed to creating resistance to charges? Note I am not asking whether we can cancel out an electrostatic field with an opposing one, which would for all practical purposes work as an insulator. I am instead asking whether there is a substance that blocks the field itself, rather than cancelling it out. E.g., plastics are generally poor conductors of electricity, but would plastic also shield a free-standing charge from an electrostatic field? I think the answer is no, but please correct me if I'm wrong.
