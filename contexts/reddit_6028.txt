To those who have returned the office, what’s it been like?
My job is letting us continue to work remotely until the 4th of July, today they came out with their return to the office plan which basically amounts to “We’re gonna clean the office a little more, but beyond that take precautions and use your best judgement”. Of course, if you have any concerns about returning to the office, you’re free to speak to your boss about it and be singled out and pressured to be a team player. Has anyone else’s employer actually put in the effort to protect their employees, or is being thrown in to swim with the sharks like my job is doing a more typical experience?
