What is the difference between Ethnographic and Qualitative research?
I am constantly having to reexamine defintions of words... I read, or maybe I misunderstand, that they are different or what category they fall under.

I structure my paper a certain way, then I read something like "Action Research is not a method" ... I just based my paper on it being a method after reading everything else until coming across a literary author writing that. 

Now I am trying to understand what the difference between Ethnographic and Qualitiative research is.

Thank you.
