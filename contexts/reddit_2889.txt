How can I earn 50,000$ before going to university?
I am currently in highschool(a-levels) and recently turned 18. Only 1.5 years are left before I leave highschool and go to uni, and I want to earn as much money as I can so i can reduce the burden on my parents.

Currently I am living in a south Asian developing country, and these are things on my resume;

Interned at a marketing company for 3 weeks
Participated in several business competitions 
Freelance Photographer for Istock and ShutterStock

 What should I do to earn over and above 50,000$? Or even slightly lesser?  What skills should I learn and what jobs and internships should I do?
