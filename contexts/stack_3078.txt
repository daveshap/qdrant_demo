Why a rope grabbed by a single end seems to follow the hand that grabs it? ContextI am thinking about the physics of the movement of a rope in the context of a person running and grabbing a rope in one hand (the other end is \"free\there is nothing attached). When the person is just standing, the rope simply falls down vertically.Update after comments: the rope does not stay on \"horizontal state\" (wrong original assumption was that when the person is running, the rope looks like it follows the direction of the person hand, that is, if the person runs forwards (horizontally), the rope hangs horizontally from the hand.)When the person is not running, I asume that the main ideas that explain why the rope \"falls down\" vertically are gravity. Main questionWhat physics principles / ideas can explain the movement of the rope, when the person is running?I guess that air friction might be one. Am I right? What would others be? Tension?Side questionWhile running, the person moves its arm upwards. The rope transitions from horizontal to diagonal (switching from one height to the current hand's height) and then returns to horizontal. What principles are involved in these transitions / movements?
