What do you call a person who wants a package to be delivered to him? So in shipment systems the word would be \"recipient\but that word is from the point of view of the shipping company, what would it be called from the point of view of the person ordering the package?To give more context, I have a system where a user can either be a courier or \"someone who requests stuff from abroad\and these two sides of the system get matched up. I want one word to describe the words in quotes. What do I call you when you sign up to be \"someone who requests stuff from abroad\"?Edit: Secondary Question, What if the person who requested the package and the one who will receive the package aren't the same person? How do I differentiate between them?
