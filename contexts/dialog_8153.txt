PATCHETT: I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
EXLEY: Bud White's been here?
PATCHETT: For the last time. I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
EXLEY: Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
PATCHETT: A vulgar term, but yes.
EXLEY: What's her name?
PATCHETT: Lynn Bracken.
EXLEY: Why's she seeing Bud White?
PATCHETT: Why do men and women usually see each other?
EXLEY: Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
PATCHETT: No.
EXLEY: Not good enough.
PATCHETT: Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
