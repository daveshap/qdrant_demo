I need advice ig lol
so I can’t tell if I just have high adrenaline or I’m actually just sad but I haven’t been myself lately. I’m very responsible I do my homework, and I have lots of friends, but I don’t feel like I’m having the high school experience. I haven’t got to Interact with many males my age except old grade school friends because I go to an all girls school. I go to that school because of it’s academics and I don’t want to move. I honestly don’t want to wait till I’m 18 or 19 to go to a party, or enjoy myself. But I feel as if all of my friends don’t do those type of things, and I don’t have anyone to do them with. I also enjoy hanging out with friends and doing different things. But my friends always say they can’t every time I’m available, and I always can’t every time their available. I’m not introverted or extroverted I just try not to get to close to people who seem to get a bad rep but I’m friendly no matter what. I also suck at starting conversations cause I can be awkward and quieter at first (even though I said I wasn’t that introverted). I don’t have a clear idea of what I’m asking. I just want to enjoy high school and do “high school” things whilst still being able to work hard for my grades. I also want to make more friends and ones that are open to going places even though I still like my friends I have now.
