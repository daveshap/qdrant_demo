EDIT: I was discharged from rehab today at 10AM. My posts on snapchat ended up getting 911 called. I recovered and was diagnosed with "Severe Depressive Disorder" I threw all of my drugs away. I am a sober man and i am living better.

EDIT #2: If you guys want a full story from start to finish, just say so. Also, i made this quote in rehab. "If you base your life on a dark past, there is no bright future" -Reese Marsteller(ME)

EDIT #3: My liver might be shutting down. I ate a lot of bad food and im feeling bad. My eyes are yellow. Might be making a 911 call.
