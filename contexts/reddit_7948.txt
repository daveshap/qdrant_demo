Rewriting The Results Description for My Paper
Hi everyone. I need some pointers. Running into a brick wall here on my paper.

The topic of the post-grad paper i'm working on is  *"Factors Influencing X-Country's Stock Market Performance."*  (DV)

It is a qualitative research, with the IVs being on *(1) Exchange Rate, (2) Inflation Rate, (3) The US' Stock Market Performance, (4) Crude Oil Price.*

Chapter 1: IntroductionChapter 2: Lit ReviewChapter 3: Research MethodologyChapter 4: Results and DiscussionsChapter 5: Conclusion

I outlined the Results based on Chapter 3's findings. Decided to use the method of "Causal Mechanism" through qualitative research method to find if factors are significant or insignificant. What I have done so far in Chapter 4 is to outline the articles i found supporting IV1-4; outline the articles found disputing IV1-4; and justify based on that if it is significant or insignificant to the DV.

My issue now is on Chapter 4 and 5. The supervisor remarked me to rewrite Chapter 4 and 5 due to *no logical data* analysis to present the analysis. The only comments were "*Rewrite the chapter,*" and "*Do a proper job.*" I'm keeping my self motivated, still. But I don't know how else to present findings for causal mechanisms through qualitative aside from what I am doing now.

I need advise on how can I outline the paper's Chapter 4, to highlight the findings through qualitative method. Or some insight on what's the angle or effective manner for me to present the result of something quantitative in a qualitative manner? I'm just trying to get some ideas here. Any kind of insight would help. Thank you.
