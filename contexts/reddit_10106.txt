Training Games!
Whether you love them or hate them, playing games during training for a new staff can provide much-needed time for bonding, learning about one another, and team cohesion. What are some of your favorite/most effective games/activities you play at training?

If it's a bit obscure or goes by different titles, you might also want to include details, explanations, etc. I'll happily offer mine a bit later today when I'm not as swamped!
