Ghosted by my boss
I recently got a job working at a restaurant. I was hired after booking tickets out of town to see family for Thanksgiving. I told my employer this as soon as I was hired. She said it was fine. In the two weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, I was put on the schedule sparingly and then my boss told me that she wanted to hold off on training until I returned from Thanksgiving. I asked her if she would definitely be able to give me hours once I returned. She said yes, she definitely would be able to give me about 20 hours a week. Then I got the schedule for the week I returned to town. I wasn't on the schedule. I texted her asking if what we had discussed previously with regards to my hours still stood. She never texted me back. So, I am off the schedule and not being texted back by my employer. I've been ghosted. I have a small check to pick up, but it will be so uncomfortable to do so I am putting it off. Advice?

TLDR: I was ghosted by my employer.
