COLUMBUS: I could be gone for years.
BEATRIX: I know.
COLUMBUS: I haven't given you much of a life.
BEATRIX: Well... that's true. I have a child by a man who won't marry me! Who's always leaving...
COLUMBUS: Are we going to argue?
BEATRIX: I'd love to argue with you sometimes. But you're never here!
COLUMBUS: Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
BEATRIX: I find that hard to believe.
