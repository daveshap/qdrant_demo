MISS HO KYM: My name is Miss Ho Kym. Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass. Nice to meet you, Craig. Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
CRAIG: Excuse me?
MISS HO KYM: I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
CRAIG: Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
MISS HO KYM: Well, then, it's all good. Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street? I've been seeing a lot of activity.
CRAIG: What kind of activity?
MISS HO KYM: Strange activity. I think they running drugs off Tijuana. Day-Day don't believe me.
