Relationship Advice? Sex Advice?
So basically I am not in a relationship with anyone, not dating them at least. They told me a while back, after they first confessed they were attracted to me, that they didn't want to date me because they didn't want to mess it up. I was okay with not being in a relationship with them, but I share the same feelings with them. A month or so ago we were having a deep conversation and they said that the main reason why they didn't want to date me was because they knew we would never break up unless it was very serious. They didn't want to lose me, and jeopardize our relationship. I understand completely. 

So even though we aren't dating, we say we love each other everyday, talk everyday, play video games together, and we even sit down and watch movies together for hours quite often. There is never a day that goes by without us showing our affection for each other. 

A problem that is going to come up, without a doubt in my mind, is sex. I know that they would never try to force sex on me. But they've already told me that they do want to have sex, and I mean, so do I. The thing is, I don't want to be a FWB (friend with benefits) to them. I don't want to have intimate relations like that with someone that's not official, or boyfriend/girlfriend, engaged, married, ect. I just don't know how to say that to them. And I don't want them to feel like they are expected to by my boyfriend/girlfriend. But I don't feel comfortable doing it with someone who's relationship status is still a friend. And I also don't want them just to say yes because they want the sex.

What can I do, or say to them? Am I stuck with just being best friends with them? I want to be more then friends but I feel like it's been to long?
