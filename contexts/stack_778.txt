Better understanding of Ubuntu! I have been using Ubuntu for about 10-11 months now, and am familiar with the interface and basics. However, I have felt a complete understanding requires something more. Is there any great websites which covers the nuances, like how the OS interacts with the hardware, the working of the OS and its commands in general, the latest developments and such things in intermediate users lingo. For clarification, I already have working proficiency in it, so not looking for absolute beginners stuff, but for something in the intermediate level which would help me graduate to having some advanced skill sets. Anything would be appreciated!
