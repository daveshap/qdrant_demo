ANDY: Ready for round two?
FRANK: I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him. Let him sweat for a little while.
DOCTOR FULTON: Kathy, please. You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
KATHY: I'm just nervous. Sorry.
DOCTOR FULTON: You're safe. He wouldn't come here.
KATHY: He already did once.
KATHY: Why did he?
DOCTOR FULTON: Why did he what?
KATHY: Come here.
DOCTOR FULTON: He was watching you.
KATHY: Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't? What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
DOCTOR FULTON: You're losing me.
