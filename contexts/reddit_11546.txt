Work has screwed me over.
Every year at my job, we have employee reviews, which bring up the opportunity for a raise.  Generally, the raises have been about 6%, depending on performance.  This last year, I have busted my tail.  I have completely got everything I was responsible for up to standard (the gal I had replaced left things in shambles, hence why I replaced her).  From there, and on my own time, I studied the business.  I learned everything I could, and continued learning.  I was asked to change shifts, because they needed someone good to take over.  I was asked to learn, and administrate, in the software.  I was asked to write and revise our processes.  All these things not in my job description.  All of these things extra.  And now, with two supervisors leaving the company at the same time, I am literally the only one who knows this software in the team of 8.  I had my annual review today.  My boss sang my praises.  My boss's boss sang my praises.  They didn't have a bad thing to say about me, and not a thing for me to improve on.  Then came the bad part.  My boss, who has given me special treatment for all I do, told me he fought upper management hard for a huge raise, but they basically blew him off, and I was offered a 3% raise.  Freaking $.42.  Let's see how much longer I'm there, then.
