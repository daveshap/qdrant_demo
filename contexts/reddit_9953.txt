Advice for the job search?
I’ll be graduating in two weeks (eek!) and will really begin my job search. 
I know these are weird times, so I’m wondering if there’s any general advice or best practices you can recommend. I’ve signed up for job alerts and my resume and cover letter are updated but I hate the uncertainty right now so I wanna make sure I’m as prepared as can be. 
Also, do you know how your institution is handling hiring during this time (for example, are they doing a hiring freeze or is it business as usual)? 
Thanks y’all!
