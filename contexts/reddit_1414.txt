I made a small accomplishment today! I managed to go to the gym alone.
After months of being stuck in a loop of staying indoors and not stepping outside my comfort zone, I decided that I needed to challenge myself and do something that I haven’t done before. 

Usually I go to the gym with my boyfriend, but even then, it has to be on a day when it is quiet, otherwise I feel overwhelmed. 

I had gotten kinda out of shape as I haven’t been to the gym now for around 3 months. 

Honestly, I’ve been starting to get super negative thoughts about the way I look so I really wanted to change that before it gets worse. For me, working out is one of the few things that I actually enjoy doing! A bonus is that it helps me sleep like a rock. 

I kept telling myself that the worst that could happen would be if I get something wrong, and people stare at me- but so what? No one really cares about what others do in the gym. 

With this in mind, I managed a great workout session and I plan to keep it up. I feel amazing! 

Taking small steps and even having the intention of doing something new is a good step to take.  I hope you guys work towards doing something new today. ☺️
