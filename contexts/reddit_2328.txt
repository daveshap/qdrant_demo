Proof the waitlist pulls through sometimes
For context: 1530 SAT, 3.9 GPA, solid extracurriculars including a very exclusive internship, and strong essays. I had a brutal admissions process. I applied to a bunch of T20 and T40 business schools - rejected by nearly every school besides a few targets and my safeties. Spent a lot of time trying to figure out where I went wrong, questioning myself, etc. Eventually got over it and figured I would be alright because I was happy with some of the target schools I got accepted to. Got the financial aid for my target schools and couldn't come close to affording any of them, leaving me with only one option -- my state school. I had been waitlisted by one target and one reach, but I had low expectations so I lived as though I was going to my state school. And then the call came. The school I had no hopes of getting into was offering me a spot. "I am calling to offer you a spot at Cornell's Dyson School." The school I applied to on a whim just because of its state tuition benefits. The school I figured I had the least chance of getting into, given its 3% acceptance rate. After getting rejected from every other school on and even below its level, for some reason they waitlisted me. I still had no hope because the waitlist itself was about a 3% chance to get off of. But they saw something on me that apparently none of the other schools saw, and they gave me a chance. Waitlist miracles do happen. If this isn't proof then I don't know what is.
