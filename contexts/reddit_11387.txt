I'm so bad at my job.
I'm in high school and working at a well-known fast food place for over 2 months and I suck ass. I'm slow at everything and I have the fucking skillset of someone whos been working there for like barely 2 weeks. All the new people who started after me surpassed me quickly and got decent at the job within a month. I can tell the other workers are getting slightly annoyed as well and I don't blame them. The managers are all nice for the most part and train me, I'm just ass.
