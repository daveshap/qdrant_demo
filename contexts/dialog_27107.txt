DORIS: Honey.
ED: How are you?
DORIS: I don't know what's going on. I--
ED: What happened to you?
DORIS: ...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
ED: You don't have to--
DORIS: I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
ED: You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
DORIS: I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
ED: Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
DORIS: Should I... should I tell you why?
ED: You don't have to tell me anything.
