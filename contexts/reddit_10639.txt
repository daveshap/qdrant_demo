I attempted suicide by hanging myself about a week ago. I did not succeed. Broke my jaw and nearly broke my neck.

I would rather not go into details about what exactly happened and how I managed to survive, but I did spend some time in the hospital. I am home now and surrounded by a few loved ones.

I am seeing a specialist this afternoon.

Jesus fuck what the hell was I thinking?

**Edit: Thank you to everyone, I love you all!  :)**
