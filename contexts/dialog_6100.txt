VERONICA: All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
DANTE: Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
VERONICA: At least they weren't lit.
DANTE: I hate this fucking place.
VERONICA: Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
DANTE: Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
VERONICA: All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
DANTE: I'm not even supposed to be here today!
VERONICA: I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
DANTE: The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
VERONICA: Don't you have a hockey game at two?
DANTE: Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
VERONICA: Why did you agree to come in then?
DANTE: I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
VERONICA: Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
DANTE: Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
VERONICA: You're kidding.
DANTE: Bunch of savages in this town.
VERONICA: You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
DANTE: I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
VERONICA: What were you doing up so late?
DANTE: Hunhh? Nothing.
VERONICA: What were you doing?
DANTE: Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
VERONICA: Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
DANTE: Who's defensive? Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
DANTE: What? What is that?
VERONICA: She called you, didn't she?
DANTE: Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me? I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
