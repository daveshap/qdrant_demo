CLAIR: What a fucking day! We only just got a sitter. I don't know her from fucking Adam. She could be a serial killer. I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
SALLY: Of course.
MAC: She already has.
CLAIR: It's alright, isn't it?
SALLY: Of course it's alright.
MAC: Clair is a hovering mother.
CLAIR: I'm not.
SALLY: This is Monica and Ryan. Mac and Clair.
