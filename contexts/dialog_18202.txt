STU: Look at this! He won't let us leave!
JULIE: Who?
STU: The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
JULIE: Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
STU: I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
JULIE: What's the bad" part?"
STU: I might wake up.
JULIE: <i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
STU: I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
