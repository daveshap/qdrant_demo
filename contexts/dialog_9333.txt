DAMONE: Hey, Mark. Is that you?
THE RAT: Damone! You come here?
DAMONE: I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
THE RAT: Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
DAMONE: Well, I've gotta be running.
THE RAT: Okay. See ya.
DAMONE: Nice to meet you, Stacy.
STACY: Nice to meet you.
THE RAT: I had a really nice time tonight.
STACY: Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
THE RAT: I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
STACY: Do you want to come inside?
THE RAT: Aren't your parents asleep?
STACY: No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
THE RAT: Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
THE RAT: Where's your brother?
STACY: I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
THE RAT: No. That's okay.
STACY: Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
THE RAT: Naw. I don't mind.
