RAND: Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
CHANCE: I see. I would like to work in your garden.
EVE: Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
CHANCE: I am a very good gardener.
RAND: A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
CHANCE: Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
RAND: Bravo!
CHANCE: But I don't have that any more... ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
RAND: Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
CHANCE: It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
RAND: Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
