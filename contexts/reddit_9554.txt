For these last 2 years me and my wife have been couch surfing, staying with friends or family, bouncing between their living rooms every 3-6 months.
Throwaway because poverty is embarrassing.

2 years ago I started the process of applying for disability because of cancer and PTSD. I lost my hair, I lost my job, I lost my apartment. Since then, my wife and I have been living out of a suitcase and relying on the huge hearts of our close friends and family. 

Between doctors, lawyers, and at one point 4 people and 2 animals living in a studio apartment, I don't remember what privacy is. But after 2 years of undignified fighting, I got my disability. 

And on February 1st we’re picking up the keys to our new apartment. 

On February 1st we’ll have a home again.

Edit: oh wow, thank you for the gold kind stranger! Wasn't expecting that. I'm in the middle of moving so I wholeheartedly appreciate everything everyone has said! I'll respond when I'm not exhausted from it all. But thank you for your well wishes.
