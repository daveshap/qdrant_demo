I Don't Want to Talk About It
I am depressed. I live a joyless life. I don't want to kill myself but I don't really see the point in living.

I keep seeing ads or public service announcements with celebrities that say: "Do you want to talk about it?" "Find someone to talk to." "I'm here for you to talk to." My problem is that I don't want to talk about it. I am ashamed. I feel weak and incapable of solving my own problems. I feel like my life is objectively great with no real reason to feel this way. I don't want to whine, I don't want to dwell.

But I do recognize that talking about it has to happen if anything is going to get better.

The people close to me clearly see there's a problem and inquire. My default response is: "I don't want to talk about it." Or I ignore the question. Or I change the subject.

How do I get over this hurdle of being able to talk about this with anyone?
