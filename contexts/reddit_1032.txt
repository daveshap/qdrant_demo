so much of my childhood was undiagnosed anxiety
my behaviors as a kid were so obviously undiagnosed anxiety and OCD. how did no one see or care. now, it’s on me to try to fix myself in a toxic environment with no access to help of any kind due to social distancing. poor child me had no idea what was happening or why she felt like that. poor thing. i feel so bad for her and her issues and why she didn’t realize they weren’t normal.


edit: i didn’t expect this many comments. thanks for sharing your stories and i’m sorry so many of us can relate :(
