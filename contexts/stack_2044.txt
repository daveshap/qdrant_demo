word for a person who learns a lot by heart when studying Do you happen to know a noun to describe someone, usually a student, who does a lot of learning by heart, as opposed to understanding? Is 'grind', 'swot'/'swotter' a good word for that, or does it just mean an over-the-top hard-working, diligent student? I also came acrosss 'muzz', can that be used as a noun? In Russian, we have a word 'zubrila', which means someone who stupidly learns things by heart. Looking forward to your answers!
