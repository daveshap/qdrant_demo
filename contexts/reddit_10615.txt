My dad killed himself
He went missing two months ago and we had no idea where he was for that whole time, and then a week ago someone found his body. He'd committed suicide the night he left. He'd been dead the whole fucking time, two months, and nobody knew. I'm not thinking of killing myself, but I don't know what to do. I've been crying for an hour and I feel like I'm going to throw up, just thinking about how dad's not gonna be at my graduation, not gonna see me score my first goal in hockey, not gonna play guitar with me anymore, not gonna do any of that. I don't know what to do. I'm so lost.
