ED: Hey. This is looking good! Paul, where's the octopus motor?
PAUL MARCO: What octopus motor?
ED: You know, to make the legs move --
PAUL MARCO: Hey, don't blame me! You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
BELA: Let's shoot this fucker! Where do I go?
ED: You'll be fighting with the octopus.
BELA: Out <u>there</u>?! What happened to the stream?
ED: This'll look a lot better. We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
BELA: Oh, for Christ's sake.
BELA: Goddamn, it's cold!
ED: Once you're in it, it warms up.
BELA: Fuck you! <u>You</u> come out here. Hey, toss me that J.D.
BELA: Okay! How do we turn this thing on?
ED: Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
BELA: Do you know I turned down Frankenstein"?"
ED: Huh?
BELA: After I did Dracula
ED: Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
BELA: Don't let me slow you down.
ED: Alright! Let's put it on film. CAMERA! SOUND!
