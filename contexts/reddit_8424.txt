What are the pros and cons of a Wealth Tax when compared with a VAT Tax?
After watching the democratic debates last night I wanted clarification on the merits of the VAT Tax and the Wealth Tax. [7 remaining candidates](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/tax-reform/wealth-taxes/) support a wealth tax compared to [1 candidate](https://www.politico.com/2020-election/candidates-views-on-the-issues/tax-reform/business-taxes/) who supports a VAT. So far, no candidates support doing both.

[Wealth Tax definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wealth-tax.asp):

>Wealth tax is a tax based on the market value of assets that are owned.

[VAT definition](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042315/what-are-some-examples-value-added-tax.asp):

>A value-added tax (VAT) is a consumption tax levied on products at every point of sale where value has been added, starting from raw materials and going all the way to the final retail purchase. Ultimately, the consumer pays the VAT; buyers at earlier stages of production receive reimbursements for the previous VAT they've paid.
