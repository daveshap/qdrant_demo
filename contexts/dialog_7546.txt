SAL: You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
SYLVIA: Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
SAL: I used to, but I stopped.
SYLVIA: You stopped? Why?
SAL: Because I don't want cancer.
SYLVIA: You don't want cancer? You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer. Gimme the cigarette.
SAL: No! I'm not kidding. Don't you understand? You're pure!
SYLVIA: Pure?
SAL: You shouldn't start now.
SYLVIA: For God's sake! As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop ... okay?
SAL: Go ahead. Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record. You oughta take care of your body.
SYLVIA: My body? What for?
SAL: Your body is the temple of the Lord.
SYLVIA: You're serious!
SAL: You're really pure, you know? You got a perfect record. You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
SYLVIA: You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house. You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
SAL: You gonna smoke the cigarette?
SYLVIA: Yes...
