My manager earns $490K/yr while we are paid $30K. What's wrong with this company?
San Francisco, California

HR accidentally released our manager's W2 so now everyone in the office knows he gets paid $490,000 a year.  This guy plays Pokemon Go all day and doesn't actually contribute, just blows smoke and gets our president (his boss) excited over nothing.  He has been with the company for over a decade and has somehow convinced his boss that he is indispensable, when in actuality he just takes credit of our work. 

The president of the company pays everyone $60,000 a year as base.  Initially, he promised fat bonuses but has failed to deliver for 2 years, even though the company is profitable.  There is no 401K and no salary raise, so my colleague who has been here for 7 years still only earn $60,000 base.  The company dangles a carrot in front of us, saying if we work hard we will eventually be rewarded, and unfortunately the naive new blood buys this lie, which means despite the super high turnover, new grads are still eager to knock on our door.  This just encourages the president to continue his way because he gets away with it.


The job is unfulfilling and involves being deceitful to our customers, so I feel my soul dying a little each day.  The positive aspect is there is no micromanagement, so I am left alone.  I use this time to study and read, and work only about 1 hour each day (it's a 9 to 6 full time job).  The job market here is rough, and with so many of my graduate class still out of work, I *think* I should feel fortunate to have this job, but I don't.  

What would you do in my situation?
