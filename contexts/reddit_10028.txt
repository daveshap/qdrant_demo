Need-Based vs. Need-Blind Admission
What are your thoughts on schools that practice need-based admission vs. need-blind admission? I was very much against the idea of need-based admission but, after working at a fairly pricey school and having to tell countless gifted students that they can't afford to attend their dream school, I'm starting to think need-blind admission might not be the great equalizer it tries to be. 

Perhaps it works in schools that can afford to offer full rides to their underprivileged students but not at schools that have a gap between their maximum financial aid award and the cost of attendance?

I've also heard it argued that it isn't so much that schools are need-blind; they're need-ignorant. Institutions don't have time to consider if a student could afford to attend because they're too busy trying to fill beds/seats at the beginning of the admission process.

What do you think?
