I don't see a future. I find that ultimately I am a useless lump living. Might as well be a dead lump. That way I could be disposed off and people can get on with their lives. I am sorry.
Meh.
Edit: Thanks to all who answered. Still alive. Not there yet. Some days are still incredibly difficult. And no the future is still hazy. But, somehow I have been pushing, and hope those of you who have been feeling hopeless and suicidal may feel better.
