Coronavirus affecting (data science) job offer
 

I was offered a consultant role at EXL Services India. I submitted all the relevant forms for verification already. And I was supposed to join in June. And the coronavirus delayed my degree completion and the company was accommodative saying that I could join in July/August. I got a mail yesterday saying that my offer is postponed till Q1 of 2021, which, in the worst-case scenario, is gonna be June of 2021.

My doubt is if the company will be honouring my job offer or not. Also, should I be on the lookout for other jobs, since a gap of 1 year before starting my first job would be detrimental to my CV?
