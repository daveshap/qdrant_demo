Why do atoms emit a certain colour of light? (The emission spectra) We were taught about the emission spectra in class last year, but my teachers couldn't give me an answer to 'what determines the colour of light emitted?'. (they were giving me the answers to the worksheet, but not my question if this makes sense).This annoyed me. So now I am here.From what I have read so far, (and this is only my guess) when the electron jumps to the next energy level in a Hydrogen atom, it emits red light. (I am just gonna explain why I think this happens. Feel free to criticise it however you like.) Because Hydrogen is a small atom, the electron doesn't need a lot of energy to jump to the next level. So because red light is the least energetic visible light, it is emitted. So then would (let's just say) fluorine emit a higher energy wavelength because it is more 'effort' for the electron to jump? I just looked at the wavelength for certain elements. And apparently, potassium emits a pink/purple colour. But copper emits a light green. So obviously, my guess is incorrect, as copper is more massive than potassium. I would really appreciate it if someone could answer this. And if you could, may you try and explain it a simple as possible? I sorta only got into Quantum Mechanics early last year, so I'm not familiar with all of the terms. But I am happy to put in extra research if you need to use other theories to explain this thoroughly. Thank you so much for answering this question, guys! Even though I still have a long way to go, I now know what direction to head in to get a further understanding.
