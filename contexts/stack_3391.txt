80/90s UK children's drama series about an \"alien\" boy with radio weapon I've been trying to track down a live-action children's TV series (or short story perhaps) from the 1980s or 1990s, probably on CBBC or CITV.A few people I've spoken to IRL have suggested The Boy from Space or Sky, but I'm pretty sure it's neither as a lot of the details don't seem to match.The story was set on Earth (possibly England or Wales) and was about an \"alien\" boy who was being pursued by a group of people, though I don't remember who they were.Somehow he encountered siblings, a girl and a boy, and made friends with them. I think they lived on a farm with their parents, as I remember quite a large barn or other building, and they hid(?) the boy in a car which was inside or next to this building. He also slept in this car with a dog (which might have been a German shepherd).The \"alien\" boy had a portable \"radio\" (all silver, very 1980s) that repelled his pursuers by emitting a high-pitched sound when he turned a dial on it, and he used it when out and about with the other children whenever they encountered a pursuer. I seem to remember lots of hills and valleys, lots of green.In the end it turned out he wasn\u2019t really an alien, but a human from the far future. He was pretending to be an alien as he was from 20000 years into the future and humans' appearance had changed by then, but he had the ability to make himself look like current-day humans. When he was in his car/bed he reverted to his normal appearance, so he would hide under the blankets until he was able to assume current-day human appearance.In the finale, it was revealed that he was never in any danger \u2013 the pursuers were testing him as part of a kind of coming-of-age thing. I remember a scene on a spaceship or something where his elders/parents where shown telling him that he was safe all along and that he \"passed\".I also seem to remember them referring to \"ancestors\" and making sure they didn't find out, so the either the girl or boy could well have been a direct ancestor.
