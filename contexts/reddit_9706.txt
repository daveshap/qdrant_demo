Should I consider TPE?
Hi Everyone!

A little background:

I am a second year graduate student (MS in Counselor Education with a focus in Student Development in Higher Education) and I am starting to prepare for the job search. I will not be able to relocate very far for this first job. This is because my partner is set up to be promoted early next year and it wouldn't be appropriate for her to transfer to another store so soon after getting the promotion. This promotion is pretty much guaranteed, she has spoken with her store manager and the district manager and has been through the necessary steps, they are just waiting until after the holiday season because she works in retail. If she does not get promoted before I start my job search, this will not be as much of an issue because she would be willing to interview for positions within her company outside of the district she currently works in.

My school's Graduate Student Association just sent out information for conference funding and I could get my travel, lodging, and registration fully funded so I am not worried about the cost of going to TPE. I am just wondering if it is worth the time if I'm not looking for jobs all over the country. 

Thank you in advance for the feedback!
