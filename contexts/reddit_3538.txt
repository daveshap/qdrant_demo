I DONT WANT TO BE ALONE ANYMORE
Just putting this out there. Hoping the universe will take the hint and please deliver. It's been a long 25 years of being single and not ever experiencing what it feels like when a guy is interested in you... thanks for your time and attention

Edit: wow glad to know so many people relate to this. I am putting these vibes into the universe for you as well and hoping something good comes your way!

@ the rest of you making assumptions about me being unhappy: I appreciate the concern but please chill. I'm doing great. I have my dream career, my family and friends are the best anyone could ask for, and I am smart and hilarious (as u can tell from this post lol) and cute AF. I have a full life and I'm happy but I still want a relationship, ok?!? This post was just me expressing this in a very obvious way because for some reason it's not clear to the universe (or men... hello I am cute AF what is taking them so long) that I would LIKE TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH A MAN PLEASE.
