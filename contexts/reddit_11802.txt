My SO can't stop comparing herself to other people, and it's destroying her.
Hello, reddit. My SO and I have been doing great. There's just one problem, though. She's a huge pessimist and self-loather. She compares herself to everyone else. She always feels inferior. Always. Worse? She compares herself to me. She always tells me that she wants to be like me, or like everyone else, and that she hates being herself.

She's an amazing person, reddit. You know, beautiful, intelligent, passionate, kind, all that jazz. She's all that. I love her for who she is, and I tell her that, but she just denies it. She loves me, too, of course, but it's getting worse and worse as she gets to know me more.

It's destroying her, and consuming her mind. It's like she's blind to all of the beauty inside of her. It's destroying her, and, consequently, our relationship. I don't know how to reassure her anymore. Thoughts?
