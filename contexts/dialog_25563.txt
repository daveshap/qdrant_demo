BEN: I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
LUKE: But you must! I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father. I'd never make it.
BEN: I already know you think you're worthless. I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become. I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
LUKE: But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important. They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work. This is your responsibility!
BEN: Not any more!
