ROBERT: Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
WALLACE: And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
ROBERT: No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
WALLACE: We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
ROBERT: I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
WALLACE: Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
