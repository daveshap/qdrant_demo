Is life currently more economically difficult for millenials than baby boomers?
Several recent articles have speculated that baby boomers dying will decrease [housing values](https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/housing-values-may-fall-as-baby-boomers-die-off-or-sell-off-two-studies-say/2018/07/17/35b0dbf0-890c-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html), [political polarization](https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/465558-good-riddance-the-last-gasp-of-baby-boomer-politics), and will increase [job openings](https://twentytwowords.com/baby-boomers-dont-understand-millennial-job-market/). 

Recently, Chlöe Swarbrick wrote an [article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/nov/09/my-ok-boomer-comment-in-parliament-symbolised-exhaustion-of-multiple-generations) about her "OK boomer" comment which said: 

> My “OK boomer” comment in parliament was off-the-cuff, albeit symbolic of the collective exhaustion of multiple generations set to inherit ever-amplifying problems in an ever-diminishing window of time. It was a response – as is par-for-course – to a barrage of heckling in a Parliamentary Chamber that at present turns far too many regular folks off from engaging in politics. 

How far is this true? Are there currently large political differences between Millenials born between the years 1981 and 1996 and boomers born between 1944 and 1964? If there are, are they caused by economic differences between the groups?
