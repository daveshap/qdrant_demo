I feel better reading this subreddit than other finance subreddits.
I get super depressed reading other financial subreddits because those people usually always have money. I have a lot of debt, mostly student loans, and am currently unemployed. Reading about side gigs and how to get stuff for cheap at the store makes me feel more in control of my situation than reading posts asking how best to save on a 75k income...so, thank you.
