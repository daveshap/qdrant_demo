How to turn off PS4 notifications for a game that I uninstalled years ago? A few years ago, I bought a PS4 game (The Elder Scrolls Online). I played it for a year and I have since uninstalled it. I did this last action around one year and a half ago.For a few months now, I keep receiving PS4 notifications to try and put me back in the game. Just today I opened my PS4 to be greeted with a \"come back and get this special mount\" notification.How can I turn those pesking notifications from that one single game that I have deleted for such a long time?I don't want to totally get rid of the game as I might return in the future, but I don't want to always be reminded of that one game.
