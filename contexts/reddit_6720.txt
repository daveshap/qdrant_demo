Recruiter reaching out to me about a position I don’t have much experience in
Hello,

Today a recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn about a position as a Project Manager at a company that does space stuff. I’ve only been a project manager for a theatre production so I was wondering if the recruiter might have just not know that when they reached out to me. I have a technical background in Physics and have always wanted to work in the space industry (I did the theatre production gig because I thought that would be fun to do too). I just didn’t want to get my hopes up if he accidentally messaged me, haha. 

It might be worth it to mention that my friend has been trying to start up a company in the space industry as well (company is currently in stealth mode and I haven’t gotten anything in writing yet in terms of employment), so I have experience in spacecraft systems engineering. I don’t think I can mention this in my resume (since it’s not official and my friend won’t be a reference).

I guess my question is, do I actually have a chance at being a competitive candidate?
