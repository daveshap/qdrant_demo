What are the best skills do I need to find a job in US as a foreigner?
I (26M) from Central Asia(Kazakhstan) looking forward to move to US for few years until my girlfriend finishes her university in Cleveland, OH. I do have Bachelors in finance and accounting but as I read, my diploma from my Country wont be taken into consideration when applying for job.

Basically my plan is to visit US and find a job within 6 months (amount of time I am allowed to be in US as a tourist) and then change it to Work visa. But before doing so i want to be as prepared as possible.

Any advices would really help, Thanks.
