SAM: Damn! Blast!
KURTZMAN: What's the matter?
SAM: You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
KURTZMAN: All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
SAM: I know that.
KURTZMAN: All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
SAM: I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
KURTZMAN: Yes. NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down!

KURTZMAN: I did it for you.
SAM: What! Shit!
KURTZMAN: It's what you wanted isn't it?
SAM: Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
