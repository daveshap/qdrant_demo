Question about a degree - Communications/Marketing
I'm an upcoming high school graduate with college decisions on my way. I'm considering a ton of options for majors (and I know undecided is an option, but still constantly thinking).
I've always enjoyed communications and marketing, but family members feel that there aren't any jobs nor is there promise in the market for those majors. Both mention the struggles of those majors when they were in college.
So, is there actual promise in the market for these? Are there actually any jobs or would you be getting pennies?
