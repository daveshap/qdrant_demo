BRIAN: Don't feel bad.
KATHRYN: Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
SEAN: Mike, this is fantastic. I mean, you're responsible for building all this. What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together. Boat building.
MIKE: It's not that easy. Worked construction every summer to get through school. Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this. Finish school first, Sean. Then make up your mind. If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
SEAN: You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
MIKE: This company's expanding. They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California. I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
SEAN: Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding. Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
MIKE: Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas. In one of those chapels. He can meet us there.
SEAN: Yeah, he'll really go for that.
MIKE: It's all up to Kathryn. Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
