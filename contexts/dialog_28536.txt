NORA: If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
NICK: After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea. He realized that he and Julia could still collect money. Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia. He even telephoned Macaulay -- Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
MACAULAY: But it must have been Wynant. I should have known if it weren't his voice.
NICK: Oh he as clever about that. He called when you were out. That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
NORA: Is that true?
NICK: I don't know.
NORA: Why are you saying it?
NICK: It's the only way it makes sense.
NORA: I hope you're well.
NICK: His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town. The watch chain was handed over.... ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something. Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
