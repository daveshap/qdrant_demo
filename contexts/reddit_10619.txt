A year ago, I promised myself I'd kill myself on the day I graduated college.
It was supposed to be April 28, 2019. Graduation is supposed to be an exciting beginning to the rest of your life, but I don't want anything to do with my future.

I'm not graduating on time anymore, now. I fucked up my last semester thanks to my depression, and I have to withdraw from my classes. But I'm still thinking about killing myself on April 28.

It would be perfect. Ending it all while my classmates are at their commencement ceremony celebrating their achievements. I know I would never amount to anything, regardless of whether or not I make it to my graduation. My depression and anxiety have held me back for my entire life. I've fought and fought but always come up short. It's not worth fighting anymore.

I want to spend the last month of my life doing things I love, or at least the things I used to love before depression grabbed me by the throat and choked the life out of me. I want to finish my album I've been working on for 6 years so I have something to leave behind. I want to spend quality time with my family and friends so they have lots of good memories to look back on once they recover from the initial shock of my death. I want to eat good food, play video games, and snuggle with my dog.

I'm glad I made this decision now. It's given me a contentedness with living that I haven't had for a while. Maybe I'll actually be able to enjoy my last month instead of wallowing in self-hatred and fear of the future.

I wasn't meant to live past 22.
