Unpopular opinion: Anyone else actually feel glad to move away from home?
I see all these sudden appreciate senior year posts. Sis I'm just trying to gtfoh and start a brand new life in a brand new place and the prospect of being independent sounds so sweet.

And yes, I acknowledge that I'll have to take care of myself from now on, but I don't care, it's my time.
