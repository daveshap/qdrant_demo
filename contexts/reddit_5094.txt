Internal Interviews but Hiring Externally
Hello!

My company is currently hiring for an entry-level position and was wondering how to handle possible results of it. It is opened to both internal and external applicants. 3 people we are interviewing are "internal"; 1 current employee (different department) and 2 are fiances of 2 current employees. 

My question is, if neither of the 3 applicants works out, what is the best way of handling this, especially for the employee that works here. 

I want to leave this open-ended to see what you all have to say but can provide more details if it helps.

Thanks!
