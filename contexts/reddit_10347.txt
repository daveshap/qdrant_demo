Who else feels like they're only still living to spare the feelings of their family members?
There's nothing in my life worth living for anymore. Everything and everyone who brought any join into my life is gone. I'm disabled, in poor health, I suffer abuse on a daily basis and I feel totally alone in this world. It would be a relief to be able to just stop existing. The only thing preventing me is the fact that I have 1 or 2 family members who I feel would be deeply affected if I were to check out on them. So I suffer through each day more alone then the last in order to spare their feelings. Anyone else in a similar situation?
