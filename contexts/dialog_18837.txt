SHELLY: I had a good time tonight.
HARRY: I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
SHELLY: Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
HARRY: Okay, sure.
SHELLY: Home sweet home.
HARRY: It's nice.
SHELLY: I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
HARRY: Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
SHELLY: You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
HARRY: Yeah.
SHELLY: Are you mad at me?
HARRY: No, why?
SHELLY: I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...

SHELLY: What happened to her?
HARRY: Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
SHELLY: Did she ever see Vada?
HARRY: I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
SHELLY: Dance with me?
HARRY: Here?
SHELLY: This is where we are.
HARRY: Is there enough room?
HARRY: I haven't danced in.....
SHELLY: In ages, I know, me neither.
HARRY: Rock?
SHELLY: See, you're not that out of touch. You're good.
HARRY: At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
SHELLY: What are you wearing?
HARRY: Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
SHELLY: Do you want to?
HARRY: Want to what?
SHELLY: Kiss me.
HARRY: Yes.
SHELLY: Good.
