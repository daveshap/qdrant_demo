RUFUS: Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
CUSTOMER: No, I wanna kill my boss!
RUFUS: Get the hell outta here. You sick bastard.
RUFUS: Detective. Nice of you to come down here. Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now. Jesus, what's up with your eye?

ANDERTON: I need help with her.

RUFUS: I'm impressed, Anderton. You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
ANDERTON: Rufus. She's a precog.
RUFUS: She's a precog?
ANDERTON: That's right.
