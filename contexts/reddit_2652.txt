How do I give my two week notice while my supervisor is working from home?
I currently have a contract role. And because of the COVID-19 pandemic lots of people are working from home. I want to provide a full two week and be as respectful to my manager as possible. He is OOO until Wednesday and I brought a resignation letter today to give to him. 

How do I do this with him remote? (Also he is extremely bad at checking his emails) 

I have no issues with him and was not searching for another job, but one came up shortly after starting here. And that is a full time job not a contract position.

Update: thank you everyone for the advice and support. I sent him a text message asking if we could meet for 15 minutes. He called me. We went over my current projects. Then I told him I was putting in my two weeks. He was understanding. It went well. Then he told me to email him and HR. So I have emailed HR and with him ccâ€™ed a copy of my resignation
