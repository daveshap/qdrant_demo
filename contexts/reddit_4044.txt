Does anyone else feel extra lonely on Sunday evenings?
I don’t know what it is about Sunday evenings- maybe it’s the end of your free reign on the weekends, maybe the stress on Monday workweek. But I end up missing my ex and just feeling lonely and depressed in general about not having anyone to hug and cuddle with.
Anyone else can relate ?
