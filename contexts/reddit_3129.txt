What is it really like being a lawyer?
For context, I'm a freshman in college. I'm currently planning on becoming a lawyer. I don't want to work in court, but instead would rather work with documents (don't know exactly what it's called). Something like IP or environmental law. However, I really don't know much about what it's like being a lawyer in general. I've heard that it's nothing like law school. So for all current and past lawyers, what is the job really like? What are the people like? What hours do you work? What did you do there? What kind of skills does it require? Is it ever exciting and interesting, or is it usually tiresome? Is the pay worth it? How was your life impacted by your job as a whole? And have you ever regretted going into law?
