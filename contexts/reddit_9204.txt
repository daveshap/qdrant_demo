[META] We get it, r/personalfinance is discouraging. Infact, that's the reason this sub exists.
A little over a year ago last month, redditors on r/personalfinance were upset that the sub had no accessible financial advice. One such redditor suggested a separate, more relatable sub for those who feel excluded when others talk about things like retirement and investing. Hence r/povertyfinance was born. I understand your frustrations, think of r/povertyfinance as stage one in your financial sub journey. You'll upgrade as you go.
