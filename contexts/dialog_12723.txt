BRENNA: He tried to kill me last night.
TAUPIN: Where?
BRENNA: Dupont Circle.
BRENNA: Who is he?
TAUPIN: At the moment? Carl Smith.
BRENNA: And you?
BRENNA: What will you do now?
TAUPIN: You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
BRENNA: He called you MacLeod"."
TAUPIN: Not your concern.
BRENNA: I left a man dead in Felton. But you don't really care, do you?
TAUPIN: That bothers you?
BRENNA: He was innocent.
TAUPIN: He's dead. Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
BRENNA: What about me?
TAUPIN: You?
BRENNA: I'm a witness to a murder. That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
TAUPIN: Have you gone to the police?
BRENNA: No.
TAUPIN: Why not? I'm sure they'd love to hear your story.
BRENNA: I'd rather hear yours.
TAUPIN: You are being foolish.
BRENNA: I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
TAUPIN: Go home.
