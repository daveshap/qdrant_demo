ANNA: Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
MARTINS: I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
ANNA: No.
MARTINS: He has a little dog.
ANNA: Oh, yes, yes.
MARTINS: Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
ANNA: That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
MARTINS: He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
ANNA: Dr. Winkel told me that.
MARTINS: Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
ANNA: The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
MARTINS: His own doctor?
ANNA: Yes.
MARTINS: Were you at the inquest?
ANNA: Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
MARTINS: He was Harry's driver?
ANNA: Mmmm.
