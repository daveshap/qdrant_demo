In Star Wars, are protocol droids like C-3PO water-resistant? As part of an upcoming change of scenery in a Star Wars (legends) RPG, our party, including a 3PO-series droid are off to a planet covered almost entirely in water. It's fairly relaxed, but we like to stick to the given knowledge of the Star Wars galaxy where possible.In Empire Strikes Back, we see that R2-D2 can function underwater, even if he does get a little waterlogged, but I can't assume that C-3PO (for example) would fare similarly.My question is; could protocol droids like C-3PO survive being submerged in water? Are there examples of this happening in novels, TV shows etc. I might have missed? I'm happy to take Canon answers if there is nothing in Legends.
