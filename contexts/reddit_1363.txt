Does anyone else miss their old selves? Before anxiety and depression messed you up?
Because i do. I miss those days when i used to smile a lot, laughed a lot, and talk a lot. I keep avoiding my past friends now because i'm such a mess. 

As i was studying at school, all i can do now is to watch my old friends grow up with me at the background. They just grow up so fast.
