LEE: Of course not. My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight. Big party.
CARTER: Don't be messing with me, Lee. I will kick your ass. I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
LEE: Carter, would I lie to you?
CARTER: That's what I'm talking about. A real Hong Kong night club. You want an Altoid?
LEE: No.
CARTER: You better take one. Your breath has been a little funky all day. Let me look at you.
CARTER: Just relax and don't worry about a thing. I'll hook you up in there. You got condoms?
LEE: No.
CARTER: Take this. It's a Magnum. You can fold it in half.
LEE: I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
CARTER: Blend in? I'm two feet taller than everyone here. Where you going?
LEE: Bathroom.
