DATA: Incomplete, I might add.
PICARD: What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
ANIJ: I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?

PICARD: What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...

PICARD: I don't know.
