JEFFREY: What's with Mike?
SANDY: He got a little jealous.
JEFFREY: I'm sorry, I didn't.
SANDY: It's okay. Don't worry about it.
SANDY: You want a Dairy Queen?
JEFFREY: No way. I'm about to blow up.
SANDY: You want to tell me about it?
JEFFREY: . OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man."
SANDY: Wow. Should you tell my father?
JEFFREY: I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
SANDY: You saw a lot in one night.
JEFFREY: . Actually. I've been in twice.
SANDY: Twice. without her sensing anything?
JEFFREY: Yes.
SANDY: Did you see her undressed?
JEFFREY: Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
SANDY: Yeah?
JEFFREY: That doesn't bother you, does it?
SANDY: Who, me? Why should it?
JEFFREY: That's what I thought.
SANDY: You're sure right. It is a strange world.
JEFFREY: Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
SANDY: I don't know. I had a dream. in fact. the night I met you. . in the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
JEFFREY: Yeah I guess so. You're a neat girl.
SANDY: So are you. I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
JEFFREY: I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
SANDY: No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY: I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
SANDY: Okay. be careful.
JEFFREY: Okay, Sandy.
JEFFREY: Can I give you a kiss good night?
SANDY: You better not, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY: Okay. okay.
SANDY: Goodnight.
JEFFREY: See ya tomorrow.
