Visualize Syslog on OSX I'm looking for a GUI (or terminal if there is no GUI) application that provides the following:Visualization of syslog logs.Filtering: For example, I can filter a particular type of logs, a particular PID, etc..Basically, I have an application that logs to syslog. I want to read these logs comfortably. Console.app only does show the syslog file, which is, not quite different than opening the file in a note pad.Any ideas?
