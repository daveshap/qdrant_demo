ALEXANDER: I've been working.
PHILBY: I came by the house every day after the funeral. And then every week. Then every other month. Then I stopped coming. Did you even notice?
ALEXANDER: I'm sorry, David.
PHILBY: It hurt me, Alex. Very much.
ALEXANDER: Then why are you here?
PHILBY: It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson. He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming. I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
ALEXANDER: For God's Sake, David --
PHILBY: There are some things I need to say to you. You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
ALEXANDER: You care for me. And you're concerned. And I have to start living my life again. I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
PHILBY: But you won't listen. You won't see me, you won't see anyone. What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy? That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
ALEXANDER: Hiding?
PHILBY: You know that's what it is. Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
ALEXANDER: That's because I'm working. You remember that? You used to care about your work.
PHILBY: I care more about my life. And yours.
