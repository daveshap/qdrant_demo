We’re together, but I’m confused.
So I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 3 months,  she’s head over heels about me, at least she was.... it wasn’t until the past few weeks I’ve noticed a change in everything, the way she’s text, talked, body language. She finally told me she’s still stuck on her Ex and she doesn’t know what to do, she’s struggling with us, she’s said she doesn’t want to hurt me at all, she really likes me, she thinks we’re meant for each other and everything, but she’s saying this stuff.... I’m very confused and hurt, we’re still together right now, but she goes back to school in about two weeks and she told me when she gets down there she’ll finally be able to really think about us. I don’t really want to lose her, I really like her, I just really really hope we’ll be okay. Sorry for the long post, I like Reddit’s community and I thought they could help/talk to me.
