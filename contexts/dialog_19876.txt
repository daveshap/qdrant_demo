WILLIAM: Martin -- your customer.
MARTIN: Can I help you?
SPIKE: Hey.
WILLIAM: Hi...
WILLIAM: Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
SPIKE: Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
WILLIAM: There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
SPIKE: Right. Vicious circle. And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
SPIKE: There's something wrong with the goggles though...
WILLIAM: No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
SPIKE: Groovy. You should do more of this stuff.
WILLIAM: So -- any messages?
SPIKE: Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
WILLIAM: Two? That's it?
SPIKE: You want me to write down all your messages?
WILLIAM: Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
SPIKE: Ahm let's see -- ahm. No. Gone completely. Oh no, wait. There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
WILLIAM: Right. No one else?
SPIKE: Absolutely not.
