BRODY: This is Matt Hooper...
QUINT: I know who he is...
BRODY: He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
HOOPER: I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
QUINT: Transplants?
HOOPER: -- and an America's Cup Trials...
QUINT: I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
HOOPER: And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
QUINT: Are you now. I know about porkers in the water -- Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
HOOPER: I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
QUINT: Let me see your hands...
QUINT: Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means.
HOOPER: Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks...
BRODY: Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
QUINT: What do you mean 'We...?'
BRODY: It's my charter. My party.
QUINT: All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him... ...along for ballast.
BRODY: You got it.
