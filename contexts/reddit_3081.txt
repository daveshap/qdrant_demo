What are signs that you're NOT going to get fired?
Yes, you read the title correctly.

I seem to get fired pretty easily (due to a variety of learning challenges...not anything related to violations or disrespect). I am getting counseling for these challenges, but my question still remains.

Even at my current job when I'm constantly asking for feedback on my job performance, I'm still waking up every day hoping I don't get fired, and breathing a sigh of relief at the end of the day when I still have my job.

**So what are signs that I'm "safe" at work?** At what point can I hit autopilot and just do my job without having to be 100% vigilant?

(And a note that I am not new to the workforce--already held several jobs; most of them ended in disaster despite my best efforts)
