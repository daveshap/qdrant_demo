I am lonely
I want to know what it's like to love someone unconditionally. I want to know what it's like to have someone to talk to. I want to know what it's like to *really* know someone. Honestly, I don't even know myself. I feel like I'm not the person I want to be. I keep dreaming and imagining being someone I'm not. I don't want to be me. I am not me. The truth is, I don't have anyone.. not even myself.
