How should I respond to HR about issues in my personnel file?
I've been on the job hunt for a while and decided to look at my personnel file's from previous employers. Seems like it would be a smart approach considering one gave me a bad reference. Anyway, there's one employer in particular that is prepping my documents to send over. When I asked them if they would be my contact person if there are any issues with the file. They asked me "Are you anticipating any?" I don't know how to respond to this.
