VADA: I like the freak show.
HARRY: I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
SHELLY: I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
VADA: Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
SHELLY: Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
