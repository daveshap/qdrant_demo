DAMON: So, what's the story with your friend?
KATE: My friend has lost her fucking mind...
DAMON: What's she doing?
KATE: She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
DAMON: What for?
KATE: So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
DAMON: No, really. What's she doing?
KATE: Really. She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
DAMON: Seriously.
