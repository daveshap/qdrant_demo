Depression Ruining Concentration
I am a college student, and I am really struggling with depression and anxiety. Recently, I have noticed that it's become very difficult for me to concentrate during my classes and while trying to do my homework. I just don't have any sort of attention span anymore. I'm lucky if I can pay attention and take notes through half of an hour long lecture. I know that lack of concentration can be a symptom of depression, but I haven't brought it up to my therapist because I don't know if it's because of my depression or just because I'm not trying hard enough to pay attention. Am I just using my depression as an excuse to not pay attention in class?
