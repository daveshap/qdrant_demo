Applying for another master's program
I am going to earn my master's degree in Business Administration. However, I am more interested in data analysis and machine learning. I applied for the company that I really wanted to work and get a rejection due to my lack of technical knowledge. To be a data analysis, is it really necessary to get education or is it possible to learn by your own and if yes, how long does it take?
