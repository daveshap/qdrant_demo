Atmospheric Conditions leading to different colorations What kind of atmosphere would a planet need to alter the color of the sun and moon? I know this is rather broad, but I know that a certain gas in our atmosphere colors the sky blue, and gives the sun a yellow tint.So, what kind of gases, and how much of them, would be required to alter the coloration of the sun to red?
