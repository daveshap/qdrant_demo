I'm really tired of people just telling me to stop worrying or fearing things
You think I choose to feel this way? "Just don't worry about it" wow thanks, clearly my subconscious just needed a reminder not to worry. Amazing advice, thanks.


I have some really bad fears that I can't get over and I am just at my breaking point. I don't know what to do anymore
