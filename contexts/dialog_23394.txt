JASON: See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
JUDD: But why come to me?
JASON: Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
JUDD: She was my patient.
JUDD: What was she to you?
JASON: I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
JUDD: I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
JASON: I've lost my knack.
