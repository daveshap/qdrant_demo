Is it normal to want the work-life balance when job hunting?
The reason why I ask is because I see myself dreading the concept of working 9-5(or 8-5) for 5 days a week, and that I see myself working for 3 days a week, 12 hours a day(or 10 hours depending on the job). Also, is it possible to negotiate a schedule like this in an interview?
