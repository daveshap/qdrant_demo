Well Fuck Boys.
Well fuck boys, I got in. I just got the acceptance letter to my dream college, and the only college I applied too. After a stressful SAT where I forgot a calculator. After getting caught with pills in tenth grade, and trying my damnedest to not get in any trouble after ( I did). After sucking dick the first two years and having to try my hardest to get all A' s to bring my GPA up. I did it. And you boys helped, always been a lurker and I love this community. 

Edit: I don't mean real dick, just metaphorical dick because my grades weren't good.
