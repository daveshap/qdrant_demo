Two weeks ago, I received a $2.50 raise, bringing my hourly wage from $15.00/hr to $17.50/hr. Today, I learned my hours are being cut from 40 to 24. Now what?!!!!!!!!!
I'm really just so pissed off and sad. I feel like I actually only got a raise because they knew my hours were getting cut, and they didn't want to make me feel bad. I can't believe this. And I was getting commission, but since I'm not full-time "for the time being" I don't receive commission. Overall my monthly income is now $1,000.00 less... I'm just venting and I do realize it could be worse. Still, this sucks. I'm 24.  I have hospital bills (\~$80/mo), credit card bills (\~$215/mo), other fucking bills, (\~$300/mo). I was saving up to move out of my parents' buuuuuuut that's not happening now I guess.

My employers have told me not to get a second PT job at the moment because "it's only temporary" and "it could only be a month or two" Well what the fuck does that mean? No one tells me anything at this company. This is fucking bonkers. I feel like sticking my head in a microwave.
