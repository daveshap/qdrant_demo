ED: Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
WILSON: Gate's open. I had a butcher's at the house.
ED: Who'd you butcher at the house?
WILSON: Butcher's hook. Look. I don't much reckon those minders of his.
ED: Huh?
WILSON: He's brought in the heavy mob.
ED: What?
WILSON: Extra muscle. Bodyguards.
ED: Has he?
WILSON: They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry. Watch it.
ED: That was one of them?
WILSON: See what I mean? Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
