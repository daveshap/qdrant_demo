WASHINGTON: 'Continentals', Congress' paper money. It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless. Can you tell which one is fake?
LAFAYETTE: I... they look both the same.
WASHINGTON: The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
WASHINGTON: No, please; an advance on your salary.
LAFAYETTE: Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take. I am serving without salary.
WASHINGTON: You must be very rich.
LAFAYETTE: I am. Then, I understand you too serve without salary. You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening. I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
WASHINGTON: 'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
LAFAYETTE: I only meant...
WASHINGTON: These supplies...?
LAFAYETTE: Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
WASHINGTON: And how rusty are these muskets?
LAFAYETTE: Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
WASHINGTON: Well, we will accept these charming little gifts. When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
LAFAYETTE: I rode here, on my horse.
WASHINGTON: Chose another. Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
HAMILTON: Are you going to keep him, sir?
WASHINGTON: We better, Congress invented him.
