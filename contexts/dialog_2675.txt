DELACROIX: What are you? A man or a mouse? Are you a punk? Punking out on me?
MANTAN: No.
DELACROIX: You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
MANTAN: Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
DELACROIX: You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost. Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
MANTAN: Yeah.
DELACROIX: And now is definitely not the time to bitch up.
TAVIS SMILEY: Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan. Thanks for coming in.
MANTAN: Tavis, thank you for having me.
TAVIS SMILEY: Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview. You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
MANTAN: I'm more comfortable around my people.
TAVIS SMILEY: Let's jump right into it. Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue. How do you see all of this?
MANTAN: Yo, Tavis, check it out. This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money. Like my man Mase says, it's all about the Benjamins.""
TAVIS SMILEY: Money and nothing else?
MANTAN: Money makes the world go round. It ain't no joke being poor. I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'? I've lived on the street. I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
TAVIS SMILEY: Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
MANTAN: No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand. Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing. If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it. Or better yet write your own show. Do it better.
TAVIS SMILEY: Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
MANTAN: I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple. Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL. It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem. This is America. Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else. I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
TAVIS SMILEY: I admit, that's a very hard thing to do. Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB. 125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR. IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS.
TAVIS SMILEY: Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn. Go 'head.
BIG BLACK: Microphone check, one, two. One, two. Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul. Why you perpetrating? You a sellout.
