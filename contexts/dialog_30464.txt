JORGE: What are you doing here? Get out.
VIRIDIANA: Leave him alone.
JORGE: You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
VIRIDIANA: Do they worry you that much, then?
JORGE: They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
JORGE: There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
VIRIDIANA: I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
JORGE: Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
VIRIDIANA: I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
