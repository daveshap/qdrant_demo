TRACY: One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
DAVE: You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
TRACY: what?
DAVE: Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
TRACY: No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
DAVE: I know. I know its not by choice. I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
TRACY: What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
DAVE: What kind of person?
DAVE: Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met. I mean, you're the real thing. Special.
TRACY: Thank you.
DAVE: And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
