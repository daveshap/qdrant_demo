FRED: You loved her, didn't you? You really loved her.
GEORGE: Yeah, Dad. I really did. What am I gonna do?
FRED: Tough spot.
GEORGE: You mad at me?
FRED: Not mad.
GEORGE: Yeah, you are. I can tell by the way you look at me.

GEORGE: I know. I'm great at what I do, Dad. I mean, I'm really great.
FRED: Let me tell you something, son. You would have been great at anything.
