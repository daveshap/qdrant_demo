PETE: No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big E" starin' at me."
ED: You know what that Big E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm."
PETE: Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
ED: What'll it be?

PETE: I haven't got it yet.
ED: Nice night.

PETE: You missed somethin', Ed.
ED: I did? I didn't see anything.
PETE: Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
