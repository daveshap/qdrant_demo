Letters Of Recommendation 101
It’s that time of year where everyone has to request letters of recommendation, except now it’s **extra** awkward since you can’t even ask in person! Here’s everything you need to know about letters of recommendation.


&nbsp;


**What are letters of recommendation? (Yes, this is a 101 post, so EVERYTHING you need to know will be included)**

Letters of recommendation (in the context of applying to college) are letters written by other people, which support your college application. They’re written by your teachers and guidance counselors, but sometimes also by coaches, bosses, and even your peers. Colleges use them to learn about you as a student, but also about your personal qualities (the transcript can tell them how you are as a student). According to Yale, recommenders “write about such things as your intellectual curiosity, energy, relationships with classmates, and impact on the classroom environment. Obviously it is important to ask for recommendations from teachers who know you well.” 


As a rule of thumb, most schools ask for 2 teacher recommendations, 1 guidance counselor recommendation, and some schools will allow you to submit an extra recommendation (from a coach, boss, peer, etc.). 


&nbsp;


**How do I pick which teachers to ask?**


In general, it doesn’t really matter what subjects they teach. What’s much more important is your relationship with the teachers. This teacher should be able to talk about to your personality, work ethic, and interests beyond simply saying that you got good grades.

**Do**: pick a teacher that you have rapport with, or who is involved in some way outside the classroom (perhaps they are your sports coach, or your supervisor for one of your clubs). 

**Don’t**: pick a teacher just because you aced their class. If the teacher doesn’t have anything interesting to say about you, even though you did well in their class, it would be better if you picked another teacher. 

**What if I’m kinda quiet and don’t have a great relationship with any of my teachers and it’s kinda weird now that we’re online?**: ideally, the teachers that you are asking for a rec are involved outside of just a single class. If you see them in a club, or a sport, then continue to build your relationship once school reopens (hopefully). Alternatively, you could build a relationship with your senior year teachers, and ask them to write your recommendation. If neither of these work, then don’t stress. Even if your relationship with the teachers isn’t the best, you can greatly improve their recommendation by giving them the tools they need to write you a glowing letter. 


&nbsp;


**Okay, okay, tell me. How do I get my teachers to write me a banger rec?**


First, you want to include a brief resume. This should have your ECs, academic stats, awards, and anything else that you're proud of or want to include (whether those are your interests that aren’t fully fleshed ECs, like reading, woodworking, fitness, etc. or any extenuating circumstances)

You also want to prepare a Q&A letter that will help your recommender truly personalize your rec. I was lucky enough to have my teachers explicitly state what they wanted me to write about, but here’s the gist of the questions. 

* “Is there anything specific you would like me to write about?” (If you want them to address something you find important, here is the place). 

* “Describe any important or relevant extracurriculars and what you’ve learned.” This is important because your teachers probably don’t have a great idea of what you do outside of class, and can use this information to talk about it in a more insightful way. 

* “Describe how you did in my class, as well as any challenges faced or obstacles overcome. If there is a single time that you felt like you excelled in the class, then describe it.” Reminder: your teacher probably teaches a lot of students. This is more to jog their memory so that they can specifically write YOUR letter (especially since you’ll probably be out of their class by the time they actually write it). 


&nbsp;


**Sure, but we’re online right now. How do I actually ASK for a rec?**

If your classes are still online, my personal recommendation would be to stay behind, and just ask like you would if you were in person. Ask if they would be willing to write a letter of recommendation for you, and give them a couple reasons why you think they would be a good fit--perhaps you two have a good relationship, or you’ve really been challenged by the class, etc.


You could also do it via email. Here, I’ve ripped off u/ScholarGrade’s example of what your email should look like: 

> "Hi Mr. Smith, I've really enjoyed your class and it's one of the reasons I want to major in Chemistry at MIT. I feel like you made it real and exciting and so much more than just an academic subject - it’s become a passion of mine. Would you be willing to write a recommendation letter for my college application?"

> "Here's a resume for your reference. Just a heads up – I'm planning to apply to eight colleges and several scholarships as well, so I will probably be coming back to you for more copies in the next couple of months. Let me know if you have any questions. I really appreciate you doing this – at selective schools like MIT, a detailed and specific recommendation letter can make a big difference. Thanks again!"


&nbsp;


**Okay, I asked for a rec and they said yes. Now what?**

* **Let your recommenders know what colleges you are applying to, as well as the earliest deadline.** It’s okay if you don’t have a full list, you can always update them later. The important part is that your teacher knows the latest by when they can get their recommendation in. Nowadays, however, most recommendation letters are done digitally, so the teacher only has to submit one copy and a system will automatically send it to every college. Every school is different: figure out what your school does. 

* **Follow up with your recommender as the deadline gets closer.** Ideally, your recommender will get it in much before the deadline, but following up ensures that you don’t stress if they submit it the day of or even late.

**Do I need 1 STEM and 1 humanities rec?**

Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't matter much what subjects your recommenders teach. It may be a bit strange if you apply for a STEM major but only have humanities recs or vice versa, but in general, pick teachers that you have a good relationship with. The only time where you should actively seek 1 STEM and 1 humanities rec is if a specific school asks for that. 


&nbsp;


**What about my counselor rec?**


You would go about a similar process--send them your resume, a quick Q&A sheet about yourself (minus the specifics about your class), and check in with them to make sure they get your rec in on time. To be completely honest, counselor recs don’t matter much unless they’re highly positive, address extenuating circumstances, or negative. 


**EDIT**: A comment by u/BlaqOptic [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gm1jbc/letters_of_recommendation_101/fr2uw3q/) explains more in depth the use of counselor recommendations. In summary, they provide important context to course rigor/selection as well as your activities.


* **Highly positive**: if your counselor describes you as one of the brightest kids to ever come through the school, or if you are literally a ray of sunshine that is kind to everyone and is loved by everyone, then colleges will make note of that. This is somewhat hard to convey in your own essays because it seems like bragging.

* **Address extenuating circumstances**: by having your guidance counselor explain circumstances, it gives more credibility to the issue, and also indicates that the impact was significant enough to be worth explaining. 

* **Negative**: negative recommendations are extremely rare, but even a single one can sink your entire app. Admissions officers want kids whose teachers/counselors will advocate for them wholeheartedly. 


&nbsp;


**Do recommendations even matter that much?**

Similar to the guidance counselor rec, these recommendations don’t matter too much unless they’re highly positive, address extenuating circumstances or are negative. 


* **How do I avoid getting a negative rec?**: first and foremost, if a teacher ever seems hesitant to write you a rec when you ask them, it would probably not be best for them to write it. Good teachers will decline to write you a rec if they feel they cannot talk about you in a good way. The best way to ensure that you avoid a negative rec is by picking teachers who you are close with, and have a lot to say about you. 


&nbsp;


**Okay, last question, I swear. What the hell is the FERPA thing?**

FERPA is used to protect the privacy of students' educational records. In the context of letters of recommendations, FERPA gives you the right to view your letters of recommendation once you have been admitted to college. However, most teachers and schools require you to waive your FERPA rights, essentially meaning that you agree to not view your letter of recommendation. This shows that you trust your teacher and seems more honest to admissions officers. In fact, admissions officers will usually be concerned if you **don't** waive your FERPA rights. It signals that you don't trust your teachers. 


&nbsp;


**TL;DR** Start asking for recs soon, pick teachers who you have good relationships with, give them the tools they need to make it specialized, and avoid getting a bad rec.
