how can i help my female friend whose period is late calm down?
so basically, my friend's period is late (by like 10 days) and i want to help her calm down by getting a test (pregnancy) for her since im like 90% sure she ain't pregnant (she didn't have sex) and her body is just messed up.

i don't know how to go about it. im 15 and she's 16 there's no way we can just go buy a test without being weird and i don't think my or her parents will help us without scolding us a lot (since mine already did this before i don't want to disappoint them) 

what should i do? please help im very lost
