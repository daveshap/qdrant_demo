I don’t want a STEM degree. Are there any decent degrees that aren’t STEM degrees?
I feel like every time I ask for advice or search for advice on reddit, the top comments are usually filled with advice advice such as “pair this shitty degree with statistics or computer science” or “your lawyer job is going to be obsolete due to automation”. 

I can’t take it anymore. It’s killing me. Most of us don’t want a STEM degree just so we can a decent job. “LOL! Just code”.

Why is there such a huge circlejerk when it comes to STEM jobs? Honestly, I’m just sick of getting advice from reddit.

You guys are this generation’s Wall Street yuppies. You bring out these soulless statistics to prove your point. Not considering if people actually like these degrees. “Do the degree you enjoy the most, not the degree that makes you a fuckton of money. Unless it’s a shitty degree like economics and polisci and not a comp sci degree”.
