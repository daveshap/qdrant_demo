The purpose of FSMC For a project, I need to have some external memory. I went for 1MB of SRAM.I am using an STM32 and I discovered the FSMC. I had a hard time understanding the purpose of this.What I read about it led me to the fact that by using it, it gives you a direct memory location. So you can write to memory without having to pilot the specific pins (like CE, OE, WE...). It also allows you to write/read to SRAM without having to use GPIO write registers, so you are way faster. (of course, there are a lot more advantages). If I'm right I guess it is a very good idea to use it.Am I right to think like that? Did I get it completely wrong?
