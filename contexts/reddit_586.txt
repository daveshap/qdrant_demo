Sorry I know it’s an awkward question
Hi, so I just wanted to ask, how do you hide a bulge? I’m really uncomfortable about it being seen and sometimes it’s really awkward because of how noticeable it is but how do other teens on here hide it? What’s the best way to hide it at school

I’ll answer any and every question,
