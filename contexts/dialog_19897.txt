WILLIAM: Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks. Have you seen my glasses?
SPIKE: No, 'fraid not.
WILLIAM: Bollocks. This happens every time I go to the cinema. Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses. But the moment I need them they disappear. It's one of life's real cruelties.
SPIKE: That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
WILLIAM: Oh shit, is that the time? I have to go.
WILLIAM: Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
SPIKE: You're welcome. Did you find them?
WILLIAM: Sort of.
ANNA: So who left who?
WILLIAM: She left me.
ANNA: Why?
WILLIAM: She saw through me.
ANNA: Uh-oh. That's not good.
