STARLING: What a good week.
PATTERSON: You mean nobody died?
STARLING: We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor. My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands. I like the blood, is that strange?
SAMUEL: Oh yes, I think so.
PATTERSON: Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
