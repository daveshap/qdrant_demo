How severe are the operational security concerns relating to Trump's conduct at Mar-a-Lago this past weekend?
This past weekend, while Japanese PM Shinzo Abe was visiting with President Trump at his private Mar-a-Lago club, [North Korea launched a ballistic missile which traveled about 300 miles before crashing into the sea.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test-trump.html)  It has been reported that at the time of the incident, Trump and Abe were having dinner, and that [the two leaders, surrounded by Trump's national security and political staff, were getting documents, taking calls, and making decisions in full view of the club patrons in the dining room.](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/12/politics/trump-shinzo-abe-mar-a-lago-north-korea/index.html)

[This piece](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/02/13/trump-ran-a-campaign-based-on-intelligence-security-thats-not-how-hes-governing/?utm_term=.b28782ab1149) from the Washington Post makes the case that this event is part of a pattern of security lapses of the Trump administration, and that in particular the use of cell phones by the administration, including Trump's personal Android phone, are a critical security hole.

How concerning should the conduct of Trump and his senior staffers in this situation be?  How does Trump's conduct compare to the conduct of recent past Presidents when crises erupt while they are in public spaces?
