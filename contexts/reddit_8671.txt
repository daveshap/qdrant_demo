What evidence, if any, is there that bipartisan commissions lead to fairer election districts?
[The praises of non-partisan, independent commissions has been sung over and over since California adopted it in 2008.](https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/California-s-politician-free-redistricting-13415225.php) We have expert testimony that [independent redistricting works.](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/14/667936288/how-independent-redistricting-commissions-work) 

But there's little I can find about *bipartisan* commissions, like [the kind they have in New York,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/11/07/how-midterms-altered-redistricting-landscape/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d0ca360cc1d3) the composition of which is [as follows:](https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_New_York)

> The 10-member commission comprises the following members:
> 
> 1. Two members must be appointed by the temporary president of the New York State Senate.
> 2. Two members must be appointed by the speaker of the New York State Assembly.
> 3. Two members must be appointed by the minority leader of the New York State Senate.
> 4. Two members must be appointed by the minority leader of the New York State Assembly.
> 5. Two members must appointed by the aforementioned eight commissioners. These two appointees cannot have been enrolled in the top two major political parties in the state.


Is there any evidence that states with bipartisan commissions create fairer districts? Is there an appreciable difference between independent redistricting and bipartisan redistricting? Is one or the other a more significant change from the traditional legislative methods?
