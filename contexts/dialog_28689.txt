EPPS: It'll be too dark to make our way back now. Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
WES: What about the gold?
EPPS: What about it?
WES: Maybe we should split it up now.
EPPS: We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
WES: What if we get separated? Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
JAEGER: Wes might be right about that.
EPPS: It stays as it is. We're halfway home now. Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
WES: You're the one with all the ideas.
EPPS: You've had your say, Wes. Now leave it.
WES: Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold. Maybe you've already got things worked out.
EPPS: Maybe I do.
WES: Maybe I don't need your ideas. Maybe I can do better on my own.
WES: You got no reason to do that!
EPPS: I told you: When I straighten someone out they stay straightened. This is how it works: Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
