JOHN: I'm sorry, alright? It was just a stupid joke.
KERI: Will, sit down...
KERI: There's something I have to tell you both. It's going to sound strange...
WILL: What?
KERI: My name hasn't always been Keri Tate. It was once Laurie Strode.
WILL: You're right. It does sound strange.
JOHN: You some kind of fugitive or something?
KERI: I was trying to get away from someone.
WILL: Who?
KERI: Michael Meyers.
WILL: The serial killer?
KERI: He's my brother.
JOHN: Now you're joking, right?
KERI: Afraid not. You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
