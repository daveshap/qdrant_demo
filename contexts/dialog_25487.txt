GEORDI: It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
PICARD: What do we know about the planet?
GEORDI: Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
PICARD: Theories?
DATA: Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
GEORDI: How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
DATA: I thought only me, myself and Lore.
RIKER: Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
PICARD: Still well on our side...
PICARD: I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
RIKER: Thank you, sir...
PICARD: Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if you’ll excuse me. I’ll be in the gym.
