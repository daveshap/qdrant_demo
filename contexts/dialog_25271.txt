GILLIAN: Well, Admiral
KIRK: You asked. Now, will you tell me something? George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
GILLIAN: Sorry, that's classified. I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you?
KIRK: It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
GILLIAN: So. There we are.
KIRK: Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
GILLIAN: I bet you're a damn good poker player.
KIRK: Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
GILLIAN: Here... In the park?
KIRK: Right.
KIRK: Status?
SPOCK: The tank will be finished by morning...
KIRK: That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
SPOCK: No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
KIRK: Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
SPOCK: In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
KIRK: Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!
