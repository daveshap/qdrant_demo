My first GF is an amazing girl and my first real relationship. However we found out recently that I am the most likely cause of the return of her PTSD flashbacks. I thought our relationship was good for both of us, but it's actually not.
I kept thinking there was some reason that this made me so sad, but I've finally admitted the obvious, I can't stand the thought of losing her, even though I HAVE TO let her go to help her.
