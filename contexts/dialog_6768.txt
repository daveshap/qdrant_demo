JANI: To coincidence.
JACK: There's a casino in this hotel.
JANI: I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
JACK: So why did you come to my casino?
JANI: I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
JACK: First visit to London?
JANI: No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
JACK: I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
JANI: Near the casino.
JACK: In the casino.
JANI: Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
JACK: Your father?
JANI: I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
JACK: The debts.
JANI: And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
JACK: And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
JANI: That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
JACK: We all came from Africa, supposedly.
JANI: Do you believe in astrology?
JACK: Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
