An Inverse Great Dying 252 million years ago, the worst event in the history of life on Earth occurred.  70% of all terrestrial species and 96% of all marine species became extinct through, according to geological records, a combination of events--flood basalt eruptions in Siberia, runaway greenhouse effect caused by the melting of methane ice, even the formation of the supercontinent Pangaea itself.In an alternate Earth, a reverse Great Dying occurred, one in which 96% of all terrestrial species and only 70% of all marine species became extinct.  What combination of factors would create such specified damage?Just a reminder, this question does not ask how long life would recover, who would fill in the vacant niches, etc.  The question is what would cause an extinction event as described in the paragraph above.  It doesn't matter when it happened.
