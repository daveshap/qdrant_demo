PARRISH: Do you love Drew?
SUSAN: You mean like you loved Mom?
PARRISH: Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
SUSAN: Probably.
PARRISH: Don't get carried away.
SUSAN: Uh oh --
PARRISH: Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
SUSAN: And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
PARRISH: Well, I wasn't going to say that --
SUSAN: What were you going to say?
PARRISH: Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
SUSAN: So what's wrong with that?
PARRISH: That's for me. I'm talking about you. It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
SUSAN: You're not listening --
PARRISH: Oh yes, I am. Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
SUSAN: Don't get dirty, Dad --
PARRISH: Well, it worries me. I want you to get swept away. I want you to levitate. I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
SUSAN: That's all?
PARRISH: Be deliriously happy. Or at least leave yourself open to be.
SUSAN: 'Be deliriously happy'. I'm going to do my upmost --
PARRISH: I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? I say fall head over heels. Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart. I'm not hearing any heart. Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
SUSAN: Bravo.
PARRISH: Aw, you're tough.
SUSAN: I'm sorry. But give it to me again. The short version.
PARRISH: Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike.
SUSAN: I won't. And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
PARRISH: You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
SUSAN: You're terrible.
PARRISH: I know. But I'm the only father you've got.
SUSAN: Thank God.
PARRISH: He doesn't care. But thanks anyway.
QUINCE: Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited. So what do you think, is it -- -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
DREW: Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
QUINCE: I know. Gum up the works.
VOICE: '...I know, it's none of my business.'
PARRISH: What?
DREW: I was saying to Quince we won't need --
PARRISH: Did you just hear something?
DREW: Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
PARRISH: No no, not you.
SUSAN: Daddy, what's the matter?
PARRISH: Nothing. I'm sorry.
