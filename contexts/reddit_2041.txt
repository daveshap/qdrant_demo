can colleges take into account that 150k in NJ is not the same as 150k somewhere else like Texas
\^

*edit: 150k is an example idk why people are arguing if it’s middle/upper middle that’s not the point LOL 

Also I used Texas as an example I’m not trying to say anything bad about it feel free to use whichever state you want in the sentence
