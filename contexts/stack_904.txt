Cannot log in (nothing happens after entering password) after pressing a key combination at restart The plasma desktop can no longer be started. What could be the reason?Immediately after a restart command (via GUI) I pressed a key combination: CTRL + ALT + another key, I think F1, 1, 2 or F2. I'm not sure about the third button.The next time I booted up, the Kubuntu 16 login screen appeared as usual. After the correct password has been entered, nothing happens at all.
