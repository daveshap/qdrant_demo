INVISIBLE JONES: Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch: Valentine Peel.
EMMA: Peter's brother? But --
INVISIBLE JONES: Half-brother to be precise.
INVISIBLE JONES: Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
EMMA: I know all this.
INVISIBLE JONES: Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
EMMA: Surveillance? By whom?
INVISIBLE JONES: Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
EMMA: Who's now vanished.
INVISIBLE JONES: Makes two of us.
EMMA: Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
STEED: We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA: Hurry? What for? I'm just now --
STEED: You didn't tell her?
INVISIBLE JONES: I was getting to it.
EMMA: Getting to what?
INVISIBLE JONES: The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
EMMA: I fail to see --
STEED: There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
EMMA: Have we been invited?
INVISIBLE JONES: Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
EMMA: Well, I can't possibly go like this.
