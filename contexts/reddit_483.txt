I (m14) have an active sex life and need advice for buying condoms
I am a 14 year old male who has an active sex life. Birth control (condoms) have always been provided by the female in question, however I need some of my own just in case. I don’t feel comfortable buying condoms, and there are no planned parenthood locations anywhere near me or free condom machines. What should I do? Buy condoms at the only convenience store in my very religious small town (where everybody talks to ands knows each other) and risk my dignity? Also, is it actually “okay” to buy condoms at my age?
