YOUR KID'S MENTAL STATE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEIR GRADES.
I'm fucking tired of adults only fucking worrying about grades it's fucking stupid. (Ex: my parents know I'm suicidal, only worry about grades) I don't fucking care about grades if I'm planning on killing myself and I don't think y'all do either. And it just makes it worse for you to say 'you working on you grades?' all the time when im clearly fucking looking like i am wanting to die. But no.  To them that's not fucking important.
