TWIST: Can't do it. There're telegraph inspectors all over the place. I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees. We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
LONNEGAN: I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
TWIST: But who says you will. I got a guy I can depend on. He's liquidating everything he has for this. You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
LONNEGAN: I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
TWIST: On a 6-1 shot? The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
LONNEGAN: If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day. We split 60-40.
TWIST: We were getting 50 from our guy.
LONNEGAN: With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet. Either way you end up with 40.
LONNEGAN: A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen. All of it bad.
HOOKER: He's right, Les.
TWIST: Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money. We risk our whole operation for nothing. I'll say when we make our bets.
LONNEGAN: Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
