Need help on a research proposal on L2 language attrition and unconscious recall
     Hello! I have some questions for you all regarding a research proposal I am working on for my ESL Theory class. 

     I want to propose a study that focuses on language attrition of peopleâ€™s L2. I havenâ€™t yet decided what linguistic feature I want to focus on, maybe you can suggest something. I was considering syntax or lexicon, but if you have a better idea please let me know.

     Anyways, I want to see to what degree people who have some degree of mastery of the language but who have not used it in a while (Iâ€™m thinking 1-2 years maybe more?) actually experience significant language attrition for a specific linguistic feature like their knowledge of the syntax of the L2. 

     I think that possibly when being tested normally they show signs of significant attrition, but I want to see if they actually experience that much or if they unconsciously can still properly, for example, remember certain lexical items that they donâ€™t consciously. 
     I want to find a way to trick them into showing that they actually can do more than they consciously think they can. I was thinking about this because of how much easier I have found and others I know to speak another language when you are drinking. Obviously I am not going to propose getting participants drunk, but Iâ€™m wondering if any of you have an idea on how to do so. 

     I know this is very vague and may be stupid, but this is my only idea so far for a proposal for my ESL Theory class and itâ€™s due on Wednesday. Iâ€™ve been focusing too hard on my sociolinguistics study ðŸ˜• at least that one is going well lol.

     If you have any other ideas for a research proposal or review paper related to second language acquisition, please let me know; I have ADHD which was untreated until Friday, so Iâ€™m super behind and desperate :(
