I had to put three siblings instead of four and feel like throwing up :(
I hate that there’s no option to just add deceased this makes me feel sick

Edit: I really didn’t all the support on this thank you guys for your condolences! I feel a lot better now I just felt really sad at the time of posting this because to be honest it felt disgusting to exclude him. Thank you all for being kind :( ❤️
