LPT: Meal kit services like Blue Apron and Hello Fresh put all of their recipes online for free. Simply buy the ingredients yourself, and learn to cook easy, quick, and healthy meals!
So this might be common knowledge but I figured I'd post it anyway since it don't see it brought up very often. People rave about meal kit delivery services because of the variety they offer and how easy their meals are to prepare. Unless you do not have access to a grocery store, there is NO reason to pay $10/person/meal for their service. I go through their menus and pick out the recipes I like and add the ingredients to my weekly shopping list. Most of the ingredients are already in my cabinets and fridge, and the ones that aren't are not hard to find and are usually pretty cheap. 

I've used their free online recipes to teach myself to cook healthy, delicious, restaurant quality food for $3-$6/meal/person. I realize that may even be too expensive for some of you guys but it's a good way to teach yourself to cook and help yourself get healthier (one of the biggest reasons people file for bankruptcy in America is medical debt!)

I know finding ways to eat healthy can be a struggle for those with a lower income, so i figured I'd share what I do to get those meals you see on your friends instagrams at a third of the price.
