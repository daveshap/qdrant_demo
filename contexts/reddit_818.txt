Step dad issues
My mum and my dad got divorced when I was about six and since then have each found a new wife/husband. I don’t mind my step mum or my dad or mum but my step dad is the worst. We just never see eye to eye. Aswell as that he doesn’t treat me like any of my siblings. It makes me so upset and angry the way that he treats me and I know sometimes I cause the drama by getting angry at him. But he just takes it way to far. I’ll always walk off and apologise later. But every time he yells and yells and swears at me. It makes me feel sick to my stomach. I would never leave to stay and my dads full time but I just don’t know how to cope with him. Anyone have any advice?
