DETECTIVE KINCAID: Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
DEWEY: Yeah. A real tragedy.
GALE: Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
DEWEY: What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
GALE: Show him.
