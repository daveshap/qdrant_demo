Won't be recieving financial aid and I feel like I'm drowning
Everything just sucks right now. I'm sure a lot of people feel pretty bad too.

Unlike most people who've finished their Spring semester, my quarter's finals week begins today. And I was hit with the news this morning that I most likely didn't receive any state grants for my MA next year because the funding ran out. And I'm crying and I'm livid. 

I'm a disabled, low-income student that lives away from home because, well, I don't have a home to go back to anyways. I rely on school employment, which is historically unreliable, to help pay bills because of my disability. To find out this information is such a blow. I hold a 4.0 GPA. I've won college-wide awards. I've dontated hundreds of hours of service to my school. And now I'll have to go further into debt to both pay my tuition and my bills.

What's even more maddening is this happened because I made a numerical mistake on my FAFSA, which took the office four weeks (for some reason) to adjust. However, they notified me late March despite saying that this issue came to their attention early February. Before the virus. So I could have had this issue handled BEFORE covid-19 hit, if they had bothered to notify me?

And now the money is out. I'm not even in a PhD program yet. Applications next year are going to bleed me dry. And all I want to do is cry because I have two papers and two finals due within the next four days and I can't handle being so fucking poor anymore.
