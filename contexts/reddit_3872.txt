Don't place expectations on who you're interested in. It doesn't let them be themselves around you, and it's selfish to try to mold someone into something they're not to make you happy
Due to how I look, I get the expectation from a lot of women that I get girls all the time and have a lot of experience. I was a fat dork as a kid who got a lucky dice roll genetically and got in shape. I was a late bloomer who is and was afraid of intimacy due to being molested as a kid. Much better with it now than I used to be, but it's still a hurdle I deal with. When you project onto me that I have to be some Casanova, I can't feel comfortable around you. By extension, I withdraw and act disengaged, throwing girls off all the time, and ultimately not going anywhere with most of them. When I can sense that you're projecting some obnoxious fantasy of who I am onto me, I lose interest because I don't live to satisfy your ideation of me, and I don't need to feel like crap because I couldn't live up to your mental image of who I'm supposed to be. I give the same courtesy to girls I date, and let them inform me about who they are as opposed to assuming anything. 

It's so annoying when people project who they want you to be onto them. It makes you feel like your actual self isn't good enough, and that's not fair.
