Independent variables in the conditional variance GARCH(1,1) I am using a GARCH(1,1) model, and I would like to add some variables to my conditional variance. I have the data for these variables, but I was wondering if I have to change these variables to variance-data themselves. Let's say my data is 1, 4, 6, 8, 2. Before adding it as a variable to the conditional variance, do I have to transform it to (1-mean)/mean before I can add it? So my data would then be (1-4.2)/4.2, (4-4.2)/4.2, etc.
