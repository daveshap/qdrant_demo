TRENTINO: Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
CHICO: All right -- I'll go out and find one.
TRENTINO: Firefly must be captured at any cost.
CHICO: That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
TRENTINO: It must be done right away.
CHICO: I can't do it right away.
