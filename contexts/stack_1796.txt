branch address computation single-cycle vs multi-cycle vs pipeline risc-v I'm not sure about at which stage do the address computation take place at each of the versions of the risc-v?I just wanted to make sure i got that right-Single-cycle risc-v: Branch target address computation happens at Execute stagemulti-cycle risc-v: Branch target address computation happens at Decode stagePipeline risc-v: Branch target address computation happens at Execute stageThank you!
