LULA: Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
BEANY: I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
LULA: Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
BEANY: So you're gonna be needin' the blue- bird" pretty soon?"
LULA: Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
