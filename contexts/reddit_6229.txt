How much notice should I give?
I received a verbal job offer yesterday from a company I've aspired to work at for the last 10 years, given I pass a criminal background check. I received notice today from the third party company performing the check that I was squeaky clean. No surprise there. 

I started the job I am currently at around the end of July. The current company job culture is abhorrent, but I would like to give them some notice that I am moving on. 

Should I wait to give notice until I get an actual offer letter? If I do this I won't be able to give the current company any real notice. Should I tell them now and have good faith that the admired company will in fact hire me? I worry it will all be taken away from me, but I think I'm letting my anxiety get the best of me.

What do you all think?
