Anyone here working a second part-time job?
I work full-time as an academic advisor but just picked up a part-time serving job down the road for some extra cash. For people who currently do this or have done it in the past-- what is/was it like? I'm really nervous about getting burnt out, so I'd appreciate any insight offered!
