Is catty/condescending behavior from coworkers a good enough reason to quit?
I like my job but being the youngest and only male member of my team I often pick up on catty and condescending tones from my coworkers. Iâ€™m not really sure how to handle it or if just everyone experiences this behavior at work from others.
