VAL: Little sons of bitches.
EARL: Well, at least the bastard can't climb. Pardon my French.
RHONDA: Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
VAL: God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
EARL: Okay, now, how far's your truck?
VAL: I don't know. If this one's any faster than that other one...
EARL: I think we wait right here.
RHONDA: There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record... That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now. Right.
EARL: I'd vote for outer space. No way those are local boys.
