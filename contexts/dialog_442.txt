ALICE: Mark, are you okay?
MARK: Yeah. I'm just aces.
ALICE: I want to talk to both you guys about Greta. And...
MARK: I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today. Could we interest you in someone else?
YVONNE: It was just an accident. Like with Dan.
ALICE: No accident. I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
