Does anyone feel like if they’re doing leisure activity then they’re “wasting time”?
I can’t convince myself to start a movie, tv show, hobby because I have the constant nag going in my head telling me I should be being more productive even though I might end up watching equal hours of videos online instead. The voice doesn’t let me continue with hobbies either once I get good at them because I could be getting better at something else I’m not good at now. I think it has made me a more well rounded and a person with diverse interests but I hate that I don’t LOVE anything. Everything seems like a mean to an end but there is no end! Does this kind of anxiety stay with anyone?
