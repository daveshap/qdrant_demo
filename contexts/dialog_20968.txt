ZIRA: Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
TAYLOR: Why not?
ZIRA: It's humiliating.
TAYLOR: Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
CORNELIUS: That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
TAYLOR: And now you know the truth. Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
ZAIUS: Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
TAYLOR: He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
