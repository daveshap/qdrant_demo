CASE: Tell me the words.
BAO/WINTERMUTE: The words?
CASE: The access code to your mainframe.
BAO/WINTERMUTE: Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
CASE: What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
BAO/WINTERMUTE: Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
CASE: Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
BAO/WINTERMUTE: It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
