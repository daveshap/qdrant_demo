SQL Server Service Accounts We have a new Windows 2016 server and I have to install SQL Server 2016 standard edition. Once I install and configure the SQL server I will move my existing production database to the new db server.I have remote desktop access to the server to install the SQL server, but I am not sure if I need to have domain service accounts? I was of the impression that the default services SQL server assigns during the installation is enough.Question 1:The DB Admin team will remote desktop to that server and connect to SQL server using SSMS,not from their local SSMS. In that case do I have to have domain service accounts?Question 2:The application which DB support will have few hundred users connecting over network? In that case the default service account will be enough or do I have to have domain service accounts?I am new to the database administration world, so I am still struggling with few concepts.
