WILL: How did you know my father?
JENNY: This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
WILL: Were you and my father having an affair?
JENNY: Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
WILL: I've seen him with women. He flirts. He always has. On some level, I presumed he was cheating on my mother. I just never had proof.
JENNY: Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
WILL: Because he's dying.
JENNY: Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
WILL: My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
