ALFRED: Master, Bruce?
BRUCE: ...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
BRUCE: All the answers are numbers.
ALFRED: But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
BRUCE: What do maniacs always want?
ALFRED: Recognition, of course.
BRUCE: Precisely. So this number is probably some kind of calling card.
BRUCE: Letters in the alphabet.
ALFRED: Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
BRUCE: How about, MR. E.
ALFRED: Mystery.
BRUCE: And another name for Mystery?
ALFRED: Enigma.
BRUCE: Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
