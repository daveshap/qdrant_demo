BATEMAN: Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball. Call me Don.
BATEMAN: Don.
KIMBALL: So...you hang out here a lot?
BATEMAN: Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know.
BATEMAN: How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for formal questioning?""
KIMBALL: 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
BATEMAN: Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
KIMBALL: Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
