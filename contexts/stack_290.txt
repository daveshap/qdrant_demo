Alternative to iTunes for Podcasts I listen to podcasts using iTunes (my only reason to use it), and I am growing to hate it. Can someone suggest an alternative that:Will not download the podcast unless I specifically do so.Will play a podcast to the end, and then stop.  What happens next is for me to decide, not the app (this is why I cannot stand iTunes anymore).Make it reasonably easy to find the podcasts I listen to and add them to a list.List all available episodes for a podcast, ideally with the summery if that is available.BTW, I use my laptop to listen to podcasts.Alternatively, if there is a way of stopping iTunes from autoplaying podcasts once one is finished, that would be an option too.
