ALLISON: Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
PARRISH: Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
ALLISON: No.
SUSAN: Will you relax? I know it is a big deal day --
PARRISH: How did you know?
SUSAN: Drew told me.
PARRISH: Does Drew tell you everything?
SUSAN: I hope so.
PARRISH: You like him, don't you?
SUSAN: Yeah. I guess so.
PARRISH: I don't like to interfere.
SUSAN: ...Then don't.
QUINCE: ...This shit's not bad.
AMBROSE: -- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
QUINCE: And that?
AMBROSE: Pinot Grigio. We're considering it for the appetizer.
QUINCE: What do you do that for?
AMBROSE: Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
QUINCE: 9:30's almost 10:30. Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
