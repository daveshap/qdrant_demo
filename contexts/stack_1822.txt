Adjective for combining some lower dimensional objects to form a higher dimensional object Are there some English words that describe the dimension of objects changed, by combining some lower dimensional objects to form a higher dimensional object. For example, from the lower dimensional object (like a point in 0 dimension) to a higher dimensional object (like a line/string in 1 dimension)?What I can come up with is the \"dimensional transmutation.\" However, are there shorten single word for this concept? Any adjective for this concept? This is required to be used in a scientific or math article.
