A little bit of perspective from a 21 y/o college student
So, I did everything right in high school. Great grades (APs/Honors courses too), stellar SAT and ACT scores (back when it was out of 2400!), leadership positions, national debate awards. I got some acceptances to private universities, some rejections. I got three full rides to T100 public universities, and I thought that I was failure. Not only did I think that I'd never be someone *important*, I was convinced that if I went to a public school I wouldn't even be able to get a job.

God, I want to smack myself. I'm in my senior year of college now and the last three years have been the most amazing years of my life. I know without a doubt I wouldn't have had the same experience had I gotten into my 'dream' school. I wanted share some of my experiences below for those of you that are fixated on certain schools. 

**1)** **If you think it's competitive now, think about what the your dream college will be like**.

During college I've been a part of my school's debate society, which is probably one of the most well-funded and well-respected public debate unions in the country. I wouldn't say the college debate circuit is dominated by Ivies, but certainly Harvard/Yale/Princeton regularly send lots of teams to every tournament. Over the years I got to know a lot of them since we see each other almost every weekend. On the surface, they all seem perfectly content, like debating 30+ hrs a week on top of a rigorous courseload comes easily to them. Many (not all) of the people I've talked to are deeply unhappy.

Seriously, think about it. If you go to an Ivy/T20, you're among the best, if not \*the\* best at your school. You eat, breathe and sleep getting into \*this\* college, because goddammit you're *special*. You're not like any of the other chumps who took it easy their junior year, those losers who aren't doing 3+ extracurriculars at a state or national level, because you're *driven* and *going somewhere.* Probably your entire life you've been the brightest in your class, and you get a lot of validation from that. 

And when you finally get to this college, you're the norm. Average. Honestly, for most of us, probably below average, or at least that's how you'll perceive yourself. There is always someone with more money, more connections, more national or international awards, more *oh my god you're taking differential equations as a freshman?* 

And this is where the competition really starts. Competition for finance internships, for campaign staffing, for professor recommendations, for spots on the \*D team\* in your college's debate society (yes, even if you went to ToC). 

I don't want to hammer this point home too much. My friends at Ivies constantly talk about how competitive it is just to join an extracurricular, the feeling of always being inadequate, the sometimes shallow friendships and transparent social-climbing. And? You still have to compete with people from every other university in the country for the 'good jobs' that you were promised by this institution. 

I'm not saying that being under pressure isn't valuable, or that everyone who goes to these schools are deeply unhappy. But for me, going to a university where there wasn't cutthroat competition just to join extracurriculars let me shop around and join things I never thought I would. I felt like I had the latitude to experiment and grow as a person because I was surrounded with friends and professors who genuinely wanted that for me, not waiting to put me down so they had the feeling of getting an edge. 

**2)** **Don't get into debt.**

School is f\*cking expensive. It's absolutely ridiculous to be just starting out in life and have $100k+ of student loan debt hanging over your head. *Go wherever gives you the most money*. People say that (most) high schoolers have no conception of money and that it's criminal to lure them into thousands of dollars of debt. As a high schooler, I was convinced that \*I\* knew what I was getting into, and that I would willingly pay any price to go to a "good" school, because of course it would pay off.

It's golden handcuffs. When you know you're graduating with debt, the pressure to get a good job skyrockets. No summer to go backpacking with your friends in Europe, you *need* that finance bootcamp so you can work at Goldman Sachs next summer. Going to the bars or a party with your friends? No, the stochastic calculus and corporate finance classes you took requires at least 20 hours a week studying. Can't risk graduating with anything below a 3.8 if you want a finance job. And doing the bare minimum at these jobs once you graduate means working 80 hours a week, minimum. For years. Until that debt is paid.

More importantly, unless you are literally trying to work for Goldman right out of college, I promise you it matters less and less where you go to school because employers do realize how expensive school is. Internships at boutique finance firms aren't hard to come by and they really don't care what school you go to, and once you have work experience you're golden. Look at the list of schools Harvard and Yale Law accept students from; it's mostly public state universities. 

**3) Be a big fish in a small pond, if that's what you really want to do.** 

If you really are Ivy material, and you really do think that you're better than 95% of other students, go to a state school. Think about getting a stellar recommendation from a professor at an R1 (high research) university, vs. competing with *everyone* in your upper-level econ class for a tepid recommendation letter, or not one at all. Think about less competition for research assistant positions, leadership opportunities, conference travel funding. If you're a grad school admissions committee, which looks better? 

Most importantly, college will be what you make of it. The name on your school, most likely, will not hold you back from anything that you want to do unless you let it. And if it did, I can tell you from experience, these fancy jobs/internships aren't worth it in the end. Think about what you really want out of life. If the only thing keeping you going is the validation you get from the name on your diploma, seriously reevaluate your life. The competition for external validation doesn't end when you get to an elite college, **it only gets more intense.**
