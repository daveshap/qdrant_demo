BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV: Hello, Mr. President. How's my favorite patient? Any tenderness?
PRESIDENT WIDMARK: That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo. What's it like out there in the real world?
BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV: Not too terrific, sir. I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
PRESIDENT WIDMARK: You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.
