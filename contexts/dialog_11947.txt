HOLLY: Hannah, I have to borrow some more money. Don't get upset.
HANNAH: Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
HOLLY: This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
HANNAH: Holly, please. Don't insult me.
HOLLY: Someday, I'll pay it all back.
HANNAH: I know. H-how much do you need?
HOLLY: Two thousand dollars.
HANNAH: Uh-huh.
HOLLY: Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
HOLLY: You admit that we're great cooks, right?
HANNAH: Yeah.
HOLLY: Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy... and some old debts I have outstanding.
HANNAH: Will you just tell me one thing?
HOLLY: Okay.
HANNAH: Are we talking about cocaine again?
HOLLY: I swear. I swear. We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
