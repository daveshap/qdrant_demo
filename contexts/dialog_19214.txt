JOSIE: What d'you mean?
DUFF: Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
JOSIE: Thank you.
DUFF: How about it?
JOSIE: What happened, Duff?
DUFF: Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
JOSIE: Don't push me, Duff.
DUFF: Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
JOSIE: What about that girl?
DUFF: She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over. Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
JOSIE: No. But a small one.
