HALDEMAN: ... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story? ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
NIXON: What about the documents he promised?
HALDEMAN: He'll give us the documents. But I think he should be offered the ambassadorship to Iran. Then he'll go without a whimper.
NIXON: I promised Iran to Townsend.
HALDEMAN: Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
NIXON: Townsend gave us 300 grand. Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
EHRLICHMAN: What about England?
NIXON: Forget it. Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
HALDEMAN: Helms wants Iran or there might be problems. All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
NIXON: For God's sake, when does this end?!
DEAN: Executive clemency ...
NIXON: What?
DEAN: Hunt has nothing to lose now. Pardon all of them. Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
NIXON: I like that. That's a solution.
EHRLICHMAN: It'll never wash. Pardoning them means we're guilty. The people, the press will go nuts.
NIXON: And what am I supposed to do? Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center? Lyndon bugged! So did Kennedy! FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me? What about Lyndon? He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down. Did anyone talk to him?
