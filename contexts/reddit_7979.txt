What's the probability of having my PhD funding package cancelled if I've already accepted their offer?
Hi everyone! I will begin my PhD studies in the fall at a private university and with everything going on, I'm starting to wonder if there is any possibility of my offer being rescinded. I accepted a while back and have already put down a nonrefundable deposit for my housing arrangement. 

Have any institutions (worth their salt) done this before?
