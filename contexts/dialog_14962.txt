JUNO: When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
BLEEKER: I'm supposed to be running.
JUNO: I know.
BLEEKER: So, what do you think we should do?
JUNO: I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
BLEEKER: Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
JUNO: So that's cool with you, then?
BLEEKER: Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
JUNO: I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
BLEEKER: Whose idea was it?
JUNO: I'll see you at school, O.K.?
