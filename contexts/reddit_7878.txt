Opening access to scientific journals
Hi everyone,

I'm writing a reflection essay about the ethical problems of research, and came across the large gap between the public and research scientists.

Would you support granting access to scientific journals for libraries and high schools to allow access to manuscripts for young scientists and the public? Why or why not?

Please let me know if this breaks any of the subreddit rules.
