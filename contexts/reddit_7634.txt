What would you do?
While some of this may be field-specific (i.e. epidemiology or similar), I thought this sub would be appropriate to help me best approach this:

I am in my second semester of my PhD, and my advisor proposed I start working hours (15+ per week) in our clinic some floors down from my carrel.  I thought this was a good idea- they want to diversify my training experience, and said as much. However, so far all I am doing is administrative tasks that I did as a volunteer half a decade ago in order to apply to graduate schools. I wouldn't dare say these are below me or unimportant (they are vital to our data capture), but that I have already fought to get out of doing that day after day. 

**TL;DR: I am back to filing and data entry after years of working out of it. What should I do?** I fear that spending hours filing records and redacting could detract from my study quality and research commitment. I know that my advisor wanted me to get clinical exposure, but it is hardly anything "clinical" and more "clerical." I would be happy to shadow or observe clinical patients directly but it doesn't seem like that is on my docket at all. 

Am I off-base in objecting to this? Do I just need to do the time and shut up? Happy to discuss, especially if anyone has been in a similar situation.
