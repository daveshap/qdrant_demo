MAN: ...why is everything always about you...
WOMAN: ...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here. That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
MAN: ...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
WOMAN: ...oh, bullshit! He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
MAN: ...what do you want me to do, punch him out? I have to work with him...
WOMAN: ...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
