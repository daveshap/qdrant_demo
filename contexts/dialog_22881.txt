UPHAM: Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg. The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor. The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found. The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.
MILLER: Did he see any sign of them?
UPHAM: No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
MILLER: Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
