Do I need to encrypt connections inside a corporate network? Provided that I have a decent level of physical security in the office, I monitor the physical addresses of devices connected to the network and only give VPN access to trusted parties, do I need to encrypt access to intranet resources over HTTP? There is an employee complaining that he doesn't like sending his credentials in plain text over the network and that he cannot take responsibility for his network identity in such case. What are the real world chances that someone would steal his identity? I can't find any clear-cut recommendations for encryption within a corporate network.
