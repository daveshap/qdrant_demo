GRADY: Came to my senses.
CRABTREE: Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
GRADY: Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
CRABTREE: Do you know he won't expel him?
GRADY: No. But I don't think that matters.
CRABTREE: That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
