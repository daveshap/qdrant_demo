BARRY: That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
LENA: Really?
BARRY: I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
LENA: -- well, if you're gonna go --
BARRY: -- I'm probably not gonna go though.
LENA: -- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
BARRY: -- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.
ELIZABETH: I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
LENA: You ready?
ELIZABETH: Are you coming to eat with us?
BARRY: Yeah I can't.
ELIZABETH: OH MY GOD. Look at that.
LENA: It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --

ELIZABETH: Why's it here?
BARRY: I have no idea.
LENA: Are you ready?
ELIZABETH: Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
