Did the Trump administration complete their stated goals in Syria?
Today, President [Trump announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1075397797929775105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1075397797929775105&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F12%2F19%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Ftrump-syria-turkey-troop-withdrawal.html) that his administration had defeated ISIS in Syria, and that this was his only reason for being there.

There are reports the Trump administration is considering pulling some 2,000 [troops out of Syria](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/politics/trump-syria-turkey-troop-withdrawal.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) since the conflict is mostly won, however Jim Mattis and other senior national security officials are trying to convince the President to not do a full withdrawal.

My questions are:

1: Where are/were the stated goals of the Trump administration on Syria?

2: Have they accomplished those goals to the degree they no longer require the same presence of US troops in Syria?
