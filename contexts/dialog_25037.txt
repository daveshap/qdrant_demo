MAY: Peter, you're bleeding.
PETER: It's fine. Tell me what--
MAY: Oh, Ben gets through everything.
PETER: Aunt May, what happened?
MAY: I was napping on the couch. There was a voice and a shot. I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
PETER: How is he?
MAY: He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
