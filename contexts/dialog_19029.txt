FURIOUS: You sure that's how you spell it?
SHOVELER: Yeah.
FURIOUS: So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
INVISIBLE BOY: Yes.
RAJA: But... only when no one is looking.
INVISIBLE BOY: Yes.
FURIOUS: If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
INVISIBLE BOY: Yes.
RAJA: So you're only invisible... to yourself?
INVISIBLE BOY: No.
