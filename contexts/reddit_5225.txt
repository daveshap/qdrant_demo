Are jobs as really bad as my parents make them out to be?
I (16) have reached a point where I need a source of income or else a "mistake" I made will end up costing my family relationships (aka the one thing I have going for me right now). Are what my parents say about 

> "possibly having to clean a toilet with a toothbrush" 

and other things of the sort true of fast food jobs? If so, I'll cut my losses here.

Edit: maybe the mistake itself isn't even that bad, but the point stands.
