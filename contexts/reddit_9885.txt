Good questions to ask for second round interview?
I'm doing ACUHOI this summer and I was offered second round interviews for two schools. I've asked questions like "what does your summer look like on campus in terms of housing and conferences?" and "what's your favorite part about your institution?" and "what have other interns said about this position?"

What other questions can I ask? I'm thinking about asking campus culture, maybe supervisory style. They're also private, research institutions if that helps. My mind is blank :(
