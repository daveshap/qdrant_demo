How important is having a degree
I’m at university studying Pre-Vet and absolutely hating it. I’m thinking about working full time and  working my way up a company. The problem is everybody I bring this up to say that i will need a degree in something to get a decent job. I already have work experience in customer service jobs but not in management.
Is my goal realistic without a degree and how important is having a degree to having a career?
