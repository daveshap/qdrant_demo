LYDIA: He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
CATHY: It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
LYDIA: No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand. You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
CATHY: I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
MELANIE: Your brother told me.
LYDIA: Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
MELANIE: No, not exactly.
CATHY: Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
LYDIA: Cathy!
CATHY: Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it. He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
LYDIA: In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
CATHY: Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods. He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it? I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
MELANIE: Why did he shoot her?
MITCH: He was watching a ball game on television.
MELANIE: What?
MITCH: His wife changed the channel.
CATHY: Is smoking fun?
MELANIE: Oh, I suppose so.
CATHY: Could I have a puff?
MELANIE: I don't think your mother would like that.
CATHY: Just a little one.
CATHY: Why, it's just like air, isn't it? When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know.
MELANIE: I know.
CATHY: Are you coming to my party?
MELANIE: I don't think so. I have to get back to San Francisco.
CATHY: Don't you like us?
MELANIE: Darling, of course I do!
CATHY: Don't you like Bodega Bay?
MELANIE: I don't know yet.
CATHY: Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
MELANIE: I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
CATHY: If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
