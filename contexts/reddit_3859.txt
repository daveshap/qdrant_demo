How to move on?
20M here A year and a half ago I lost the love of my life. She really did complete me. She was my best friend and really cared about me and all I wanted was the best for her. She lost her battle with a heart disorder and died before she could be treated. Ever since I have been lonely and pretty regularly considered just giving up and ending it. I really want to find someone to love because I cant stand being lonely anymore. Any advice?
