MUNRO: This is all that survived?
MACTILBURGH: Actually only one cell survived..
MUNRO: Have you identified it?
MACTILBURGH: It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
MUNRO: Talk English Doc.
MACTILBURGH: This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
MUNRO: Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
MACTILBURGH: Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
MACTILBURGH: The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
MUNRO: Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
MACTILBURGH: We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
