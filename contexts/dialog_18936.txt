JEFFREY: Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
VADA: More than anything in the world.
JEFFREY: It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
VADA: Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
JEFFREY: Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
VADA: I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
JEFFREY: I'd say you turned out just fine.
VADA: I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
JEFFREY: Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
VADA: Well...
JEFFREY: Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
JEFFREY: Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
VADA: oh.
JEFFREY: She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
VADA: And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
NICK: You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
