How does the lucky attribute affect IVs during trading? I started playing at launch but dropped off for a while as new features were rolling out. As such, I have a bunch of 2016 Pok\u00e9mon but no lucky Pok\u00e9mon, until I did my first trade recently.  Based on how I understand trading these old Pok\u00e9mon should work, I have a reasonable expectation of getting some lucky Pok\u00e9mon back as well.But what I don't completely understand is how a Pok\u00e9mon being lucky affects their new IV values. Are the new values generated based on a higher stat floor? Do the current IVs prior to the trade and turning lucky play a role? Could a Pok\u00e9mon with high IVs actually have lower IVs after turning lucky? I essentially just need to understand this system better so I can better target what Pok\u00e9mon I want in return during trades. What's the current understanding for stat rerolls when a Pok\u00e9mon being traded turns lucky?
