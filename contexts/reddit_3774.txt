Is dating sex?
Throughout my entire life looked for something special in a relationship. The romantic film kind of relationship. But the more I got older the more I realized that most people don't care about trying to find someone special. Most people care about trying to satisfy them for awhile. And to some people, they may even call that dating. Which doesn't make since to me because dating to me is making a choice to be with someone you value in your life but in my dating experience and seeing the some of my exes evolved over time. It seems like people just see dating as sex know. And I still can't comprehend how someone can see dating as just sex...
