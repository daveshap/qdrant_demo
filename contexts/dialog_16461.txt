FRED: It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
RENEE: I like to laugh, Fred.
FRED: That's why I married you.
RENEE: Wake me up when you get home.
FRED: What's that?
RENEE: A videotape.
FRED: Who's it from?
RENEE: I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
FRED: Does it say anything on the tape?
RENEE: No, nothing.
