HOLLYWOOD: I was a victim of circumstance.
GOOSE: They should have warned you about that one.
HOLLYWOOD: She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
GOOSE: What'd you do?
HOLLYWOOD: Pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
WOLFMAN: It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
HOLLYWOOD: That's because you don't have any women.
WOLFMAN: Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
HOLLYWOOD: The girl with the purple fingernails?
WOLFMAN: That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
MAVERICK: It was bad.
WOLFMAN: Bad?
MAVERICK: The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
HOLLYWOOD: Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
WOLFMAN: I didn't ruin her.
MAVERICK: You didn't help.
WOLFMAN: No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
