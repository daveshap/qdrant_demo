Impeachment & Removal - Campaign Procedure/Precedent & Party Responsibilities
As [no President has been impeached and removed in US History](https://time.com/5552679/impeached-presidents/), I have a few questions about the process and how it would affect the GOP should it come to that:

* First, what is the precedent for past elevated VP's when it comes to running for reelection? Have they typically chosen new running mates and run as the primary candidate on the ticket, has the party nominated a new presidential candidate and they remain the VP on that ballot, or have they typically decided not to run?
* Second, what is the party's obligation in the case of removal from office, as it relates to an upcoming election? Do they have to stage primaries and debates? Or do they operate under the assumption that since the VP was chosen as the running mate, that he would be the de facto nominee? Would additional outside candidates have the chance to throw their hats in the ring?
