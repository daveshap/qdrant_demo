CHILI: They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
TOMMY: Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
CHILI: What I'm thinkin' is maybe Momo could buy it.
CHILI: Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
TOMMY: What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
