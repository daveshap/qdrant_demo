ALEX: You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
CARTER: You're the fuckin' devil.
ALEX: But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
CLEAR: Police are coming.
ALEX: That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
ALEX: My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
CARTER: Intervention?" What are you
ALEX: Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
