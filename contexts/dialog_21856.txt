WILLCOX HILLYER: What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
DADDY: Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
WILLCOX HILLYER: What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
DADDY: Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
WILLCOX HILLYER: Is her husband sick or something?
DADDY: No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
WILLCOX HILLYER: The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
DADDY: Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
WILLCOX HILLYER: You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
DADDY: Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
WILLCOX HILLYER: He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
DADDY: Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
WILLCOX HILLYER: You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity... Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
DADDY: At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
WILLCOX HILLYER: That's what she would say herself.
DADDY: A wonderful woman, boy.
WILLCOX HILLYER: It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy -- -- except you, you're still here.
DADDY: Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
WILLCOX HILLYER: It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car. Or maybe it isn't so funny.
DADDY: I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
WILLCOX HILLYER: All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
DADDY: No, son, she is dead.
WILLCOX HILLYER: Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
DADDY: I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
WILLCOX HILLYER: But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
DADDY: She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
WILLCOX HILLYER: Excuse me, I'll be right back.
WILLCOX HILLYER: Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
DADDY: I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
WILLCOX HILLYER: I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
DADDY: It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
