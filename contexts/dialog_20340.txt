CRISWELL: She was?
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
CRISWELL: Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: It would seem so, Master.
THE MUMMY: I don't like snakes. I remember the one Cleopatra used. Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs. You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
THE WOLF MAN: Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
THE MUMMY: Hurt her? Hell, it killed her!
THE WOLF MAN: Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
THE MUMMY: We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
THE WOLF MAN: Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
THE MUMMY: When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
THE WOLF MAN: Aaarrrgggaahh.
CRISWELL: She pleases me. Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes.
CRISWELL: Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS: As you wish, Master
THE MUMMY: He wants us.
THE WOLF MAN: Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
THE MUMMY: What do you suppose for?
THE WOLF MAN: Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
THE MUMMY: Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
THE WOLF MAN: Aannnnaahhnn.
THE MUMMY: Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
THE WOLF MAN: Aannnnaahhnn.
THE MUMMY: I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
