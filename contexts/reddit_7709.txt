Anxiety surrounding relationship with my advisor
I'm a first year graduate student (history specifically) and while my advisor is supportive, I'm not really sure what to expect as far as our professional relationship goes. He's busy and has tons of grad students. Do I check in with him all the time or do my own thing? (I'm super independent so I would have to consciously make the effort to check in more than a few times per semester). 

Because there is no guide book or "model" for how often/how to interact with my advisor, I'm super anxious about it. I'm stressed about a conference I just got accepted to- not because of the presentation, but because I didn't tell my advisor before applying and therefore am afraid he will be "mad" at me for applying without his permission and getting accepted. Something within me knows this is a bit unlikely but still. idk. I'm experiencing extreme anxiety waiting for his email response.
