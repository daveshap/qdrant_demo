LEO: The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
PETE: Well, that's a relief. I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
LEO: However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles. Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
PETE: And I won't be a communist anymore.
LEO: Exactly.
PETE: So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
