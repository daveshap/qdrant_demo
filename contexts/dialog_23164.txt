SARAH: Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
TYSON: And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
ANGELINA: I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
TYSON: Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
ANGELINA: Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
TYSON: And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
SARAH: What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
TYSON: SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. What are you talking about Ricky
SARAH: Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
TYSON: I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
ANGELINA: There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
TYSON: Melinda McGraw?
ANGELINA: No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
