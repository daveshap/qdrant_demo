Going through an episode & my bf is having a boys day
My boyfriend is perfect and precious and the best at being supportive. All of my friends are his guy friends (all the girl friends I’ve tried to make just hasn’t worked out, don’t get me wrong I love them but hanging out with most of them just leaves me drained) but he needs just a boy’s day. I’m having a major depressive episode but want to be a good girlfriend and let him have the house. But I don’t want to get out of bed for 8 hours :/
