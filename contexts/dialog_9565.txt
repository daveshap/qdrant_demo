DETECTIVE SUBY: Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again. Did you?
THOMAS: Of course not. That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
THOMAS: Look, you weren't there. It was weird. She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew. Never mind.
DETECTIVE SUBY: I thought we were finished with this bullshit. This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
