MA STONE: Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
JABEZ: It don't matter!
MA STONE: What's that you say, Son?
JABEZ: I say -- it don't matter.
MA STONE: Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
JABEZ: Make out? We'll do better than that! I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
MARY: Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined.
JABEZ: Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
