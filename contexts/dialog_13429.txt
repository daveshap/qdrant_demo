MRS. RAND: Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
BETSY: You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
MRS. RAND: Haven't I? I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
BETSY: You don't believe in it?
MRS. RAND: A missionary's widow? It isn't very likely, is it?
BETSY: I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion. I mean, do you believe it has power? Do you think it could heal a sick person?
MRS. RAND: Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl. What are you driving at?
BETSY: I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been mindless"..."
MRS. RAND: Her son drowned. She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
