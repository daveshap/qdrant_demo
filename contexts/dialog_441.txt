ALICE: How was the meeting?
ALICE'S DAD: Sobering...
ALICE: Very funny.
ALICE'S DAD: Alice...
ALICE: Since when are you such a smart shopper?
ALICE'S DAD: Since my little girl became a mom...
ALICE: You disappointed in me?
ALICE'S DAD: No, I'm not. I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
