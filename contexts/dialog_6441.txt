JOSS: Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
ELLIE: I remember. You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
JOSS: So. The final countdown.
ELLIE: The final countdown.
JOSS: Oh. I brought you something.
JOSS: During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there. I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
ELLIE: Thank you.
JOSS: You're trembling.
ELLIE: I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
JOSS: Maybe that's okay.
JOSS: What...?
ELLIE: I'm sorry.
JOSS: What is it?
JOSS: Ellie, what is it?
ELLIE: I'm sorry -- I can't --
JOSS: What?
ELLIE: I can't do this --
JOSS: What are you so afraid of?
ELLIE: Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
JOSS: What are my other options? In fifty years? Never?
ELLIE: Please --
JOSS: I'm in love with you, Ellie.
ELLIE: Don't you understand? I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
JOSS: And then what? Then you'll be safe?
ELLIE: -- I don't know --
JOSS: Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor? Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
ELLIE: I can't hear this now --
JOSS: Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
ELLIE: And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it? If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave. Now. Please.
