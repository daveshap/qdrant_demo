Okay so, I'm 21. I have type 1 diabetes, cervical cancer, and a brain tumor. I'm putting serious financial strain on my family with all these medical bills. I just don't see the point in putting them through this, and myself through all the awful treatment, just to like.... die anyway?
It's hard to stay positive and find the will to live. Any advice?
