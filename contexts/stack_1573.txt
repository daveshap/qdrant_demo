AVR regulation brushless vs. brush alternator I am currently looking for an AVR for a brush alternator. Today, brushless alternators seem to be more common and so is the supply for AVRs to work for brushless alternators.My assumption is that the basis principle of an AVR is to sense alternator output voltage and to adjust excitation power.So what is the difference in design principle of an AVR for a brush vs. brushless alternator?
