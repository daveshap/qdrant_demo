I'll be ignored again...
Nobody is going bother reading this but thank you if you do. I'm tired of being invisible. I just want to be cared. I'm tired of looking at an empty notifications screen. I don't remember the last time I went out with someone. Everyone around me is enjoying their lives except me. I don't want to wake up ever again if this is what it will be like for rest of my life.
