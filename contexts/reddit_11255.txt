Everything keeps getting worse
Since about mid-February I've left my job every single day in tears. In February I was sexually harassed (it was actually assault) at my job twice. I went to management, as we do not have an HR department and the first time they told me they didn't believe. The second time I fortunately had a witness. We supposedly have a "zero tolerance" sexual harassment policy, but this kid only got suspended for 2 days.

Things seemed to be looking up at the beginning of March, I got a nice promotion, the only catch was I had to leave 1st shift job and go to 3rd shift, which is the shift the assailant is on. I felt safe though, because I was in as locked lab. Ever since I made this complaint though management has treated me like dirt and 1 week after getting out of training as a lab tech, they decided I wasn't "fast enough" so they removed me and took away my raise. Now they've filled my position on 1st shift, so they want me to go into regular production with the man that sexually assaulted me!!

I told management I will absolutely not work with him and they can't make me. I don't know what to do. I want to quit so bad. The thought of going there tomorrow is making me physically sick. I wanna put my 2 wls in, my family keeps telling me to quit, but I'm the mother of 2 girls (ages 2&3) and I can't just not feed my family. I could h as very been an awesome lab technician if they would have gave me like another wk or so. 

I'm just devastated, my soul is crushed. I feel like a huge failure. I'm losing "friends" left and right. I really needed to vent because honestly I wanna eat these 90 xanax and take a nice long dirt nap. I wish I had the ability to just "be a duck" and let this all this roll off my back, but I can't. I feel everything on such a deep level. I wish someone had a crystal ball to be able to tell me what's going to happen, because I can't live through this anymore.
