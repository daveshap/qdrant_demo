So discouraged -- will I ever get a job?
After working in Student Affairs for 5 years (and earning my Masters in Higher Ed), my husband's job relocated us to another state. It has been 2 years and I still haven't found a job. It is killing me! I've loved the opportunity to stay home with my daughter (who was 5 months old when I left my job), but I miss helping students. I've applied for countless jobs and have made it to the final 2 for a handful of positions, but haven't been selected. I'm so discouraged. My parents and husband think I should look into a different field, but I've only ever worked in Student Affairs, so I don't know what else I would be qualified for. Can any of y'all commiserate (or tell me that someone will hire me, eventually)!?
