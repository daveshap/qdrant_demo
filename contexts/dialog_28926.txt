RUTH: Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
ROSE: Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
RUTH: Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
RUTH: I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
ROSE: How can you put this on my shoulders?
RUTH: Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
ROSE: It's so unfair.
RUTH: Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
