I cant move on
In November, 2018, I met this girl. I had a connection with her unlike anything I've ever had before. Shes said the same thing. We started a relationship, but it was always awkward. I kissed her on the cheek, but it never came naturally like it should. She says shes tried to kiss me, but it felt weird to her. The same goes for me. I didn't necessarily feel romantically attracted to her. We just had this incredibly deep, platonic bond. And yet, I cant move on. Every time I try imagining myself with someone else, i imagine her. Every time I try thinking of my future, she is in it. I wish I could take a time machine and go back to where our relationship peaked. There's another girl she likes. I dont know what I'll do if she ends up with her. We're still friends, because we both feel like we cant let go of this emotional bond. We just care about each other too much to let go completely, even if it hurts. And it has been hurting. A lot. I dont know what I'll do if I have to see her cuddling with someone else.  We broke off months ago. She doesnt want it to be awkward like it was. She says we're better off as friends, and I agree, and yet i cannot move on for the life of me. Any suggestions as to what I should do? I'm at a complete lost, and have been ever since we broke up.
