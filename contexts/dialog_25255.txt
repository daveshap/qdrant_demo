SPOCK: As you observed, a primitive Culture.
KIRK: Yes.
SPOCK: Admiral, may I ask you a question?
KIRK: Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
SPOCK: Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth..."
KIRK: You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
SPOCK: For example?
KIRK: Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
SPOCK: Ah... The giants.
