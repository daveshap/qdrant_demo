What is working for Hermes actually like?
Hi guys,

I live in West Wales and am 20 years of age. I am fully aware that business insurance will be a LOT higher for me until I reach 21 years of age but that's why I'm preparing now as that's in around 4 months time. I am really passionate about driving and am looking to hopefully do something in delivery, but need to be earning a sustainable amount of money. I applied for Hermes once and got a call asking for further details but I never got back to them after doing the sums, it was truly awful. I don't know if it's like this everywhere but based on what I've heard, this is what I can approximate.

Income:

50p per parcel (assume 100 parcels per day, 12 parcels an hour approx means 5 minutes between deliveries, seems about right). That's £50 in income, or a gross rate of £6.25/hr.

Outgoings:

Assume the cost of running a car is 35p a mile. With business insurance, that is roughly what it would be I'd imagine. Where I live, as things are pretty far away from each other (quite rural). I would assume that over 8 hours of driving I'd cover around 150 miles a day, which would mean an average speed of 19mph which seems about right given my experience of driving where I live.

So, 150 miles at 30p per mile, is £45

Total income for 8 hours work = (£50-45) = £5 or... 63p per hour.

I have heard of Hermes SE+, which supposedly you trade in some of your per package income for a stable pay rate. Does that sound any better or does anyone have experience with it? If the income is so bad as I have calculated, why am I still getting deliveries via a hermes courier?

Just looking for some insight, cheers.
