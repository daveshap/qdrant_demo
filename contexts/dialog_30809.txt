ROWAN: Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
MICHAEL: All I meant was -
ROWAN: You don't know what you meant - because you don't know me.
ROWAN: Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...? We don't even know -
MICHAEL: Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
ROWAN: I'm serious. You don't -
MICHAEL: Let's see... Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...? you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
ROWAN: Stop it.
MICHAEL: You stop it. you're loving, and gentel.. You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared. Cause it won't work.
