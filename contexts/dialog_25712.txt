CARMEN: ...I'm sorry.
JOHNNY: We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
CARMEN: No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
CARMEN: I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
JOHNNY: That was just a mix up.
CARMEN: You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
JOHNNY: What happened to your eye ?
CARMEN: Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
JOHNNY: I like it. It's kinda...you.
ZANDER: Where are you going ?
CARMEN: A funeral.
ZANDER: That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
CARMEN: Yeah.
ZANDER: How do you feel about him now ?
CARMEN: I don't know, Zander.
ZANDER: I do.
