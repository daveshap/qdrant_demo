Pending Layoff - Suggestions?
My job has informed me that my position if being moved to a different business unit "soon," and that I should begin seeking alternative employment. There was no malintent, it was said matter of factly and as soon as my manager learned of this, I was informed - Which was before there were really any real details known about the situation other than the current business unit will no longer support that position. 

* It's possible I'll change units to go with the work, but it's my impression that is unlikely.
* I'm searching internally, but I have a very specific set of (limited) skills that are a little out of place in the company at large (Technical Writer in a financial company). That fact plus the whole "world in flames" part of the situation means there aren't a ton of applicable options. I'm applying and stretching my skills, but I'm not holding my breath.
* I've prepared my updated resume and applied to a few specific listings externally, but my main concern (below)\* pertains to this.

I was told this in a relatively unofficial capacity as far as I understand, not in a formal "this is your 2-week notice" function. I assume that is coming, but I think my employer is hoping I'll find a job of my own accord without them having to dedicate any resources to me, either in the form of an assisted job search or severance. This last point is my biggest question mark:

* I've been with this company (which is large and worldwide) for 9 years and technically hold a manager title. I believe I am due some severance, should that be the result, but I don't know what to expect. Can anyone fill me in?
* Specific questions include:
   * What kind of compensation should I expect to be included?
   * Insurance?
   * What recompense is there for unused vacation days?
      * If there is none, should I begin burning through my days now? Is that most certainly to anger the powers that be?
   * I know there is supposedly an option to negotiate your severance package. Can anyone divulge to what extent?

\*I've basically been told that if I can find a job internally, take it, and if not, wait until I'm officially laid off before accepting something outside of the company, lest I voluntarily forego my potential for severance. That makes sense, but in the meanwhile, it's kept my external job search on a bit of a backburner (plus still performing my current job duties and OH YEAH WORLD FALLING APART, KIDS HOME, NO DAYCARE, etc.

I've loved my job and the company. It's only now, a week and a half after being told, that I'm starting to consider some of these harder questions.

Thanks all.
