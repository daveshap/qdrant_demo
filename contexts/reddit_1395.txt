I just talked myself down from an anxiety attack!
(Context:My therapist and I have been working on getting to the root of my anxiety, and a lot of it comes from feeling like my needs are less valid than others, and villainizing myself for putting my needs first ever. )

My boyfriends mom wanted to come over and help with yard work today, and it being my only day off for the next four days, didn’t really want to spend most of the day interacting with people and doing yard work. 

I started to go into a panic attack about it, then stopped myself and reminded myself that it’s ok to put my needs first. Talked to myself gently instead of harshly and it really made a difference. 

Still a bit anxious, but I have a game plan for the day and am planning on helping out with the basic yard work then excusing myself to have some alone time with my art or a video game. 

Progress is good.
