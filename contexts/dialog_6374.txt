LIZA: You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
JERRY: Yeah. I think so.
LIZA: Nothing scary there. Sorry.
JERRY: Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye. Hmm... Ahh... Ooooo...
JERRY: More about life on Mars. From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me. But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
LIZA: What is it with you and the space program?
JERRY: And look here. Cease fire in Chechenia. That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons. Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado. Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive. They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind <u>eye</u> to the future.'
JERRY: Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>. And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world. The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
LIZA: Do they have a secret handshake?
LIZA: That's it?
JERRY: I have no idea.
LIZA: So why are they after you?
JERRY: I'm not sure. I think I figured something out. It must've been in my newsletter.
LIZA: What newsletter?
