ALICE: Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
ROSE: Alice...
ALICE: Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
ROSE: You're jet-lagged. We'll talk about this back...
ALICE: Back at The Fishbowl?
ROSE: We'll talk at home. You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you. For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
ALICE: I know, Mom. It was great... really.
ALICE: He's in a meeting. He can't be disturbed.
ROSE: I'm sorry, honey.
ALICE: No, it's okay. After all, he is the President, right?
ALICE: When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
ROSE: Your father never means to be so...
ALICE: I know... But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world. Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh. I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
ROSE: Some kids were teasing you?
ALICE: That's not really the point.
ROSE: You're right and I'll tell you a secret. I know exactly how you feel.
ALICE: Big secret. You said the same thing to Newsweek.
