Colleges in the EU are giving degrees for dirt cheap but I don't see this sub talking about it at all
I've been researching colleges and my sister, about to graduate from an American college, has been urging me and helping me to research about colleges in Europe. One thing I found out super quickly is that the amount of money it costs for 1 Semester here is equal to the amount of money it costs in Europe for a complete Bachelor's degree. The way colleges are there, it seems too good to be true! This is why I'm wondering why I don't see anyone on this sub talking about colleges outside the US. I wanted to raise awareness and also ask those of you that are informed, about your opinion and suggestions on good European colleges offering degrees relating to CS.
