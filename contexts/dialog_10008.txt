FRANK: You're still my Little Chief, right?
JOHN: I'm trying to be, Dad. I'm tyrin'. It's good to hear your voice. I missed you...so much.
JOHN: What's that?
FRANK: I think I'm losing you.
JOHN: No wait, don't go!
FRANK: It's okay. I'm still here, Chief.
JOHN: But you're not...you're not still here.
FRANK: What are you talking about?
JOHN: I lost you.
FRANK: What?
JOHN: I never knew you, Dad.
FRANK: Why?
JOHN: Fire.
FRANK: On the job?
JOHN: It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening. Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault. You went with the training, with your instincts. If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
FRANK: That can't be...that's not gonna happen.
JOHN: It did, Pop. It did.
FRANK: When?
JOHN: October 12, 1969.
FRANK: But that's tomorrow.
JOHN: Tomorrow. Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
JOHN: Don't go. Don't go in that warehouse...
FRANK: I don't understand.
GORDO: Sull! What the hell!
JOHN: I talked to him Gordo. I talked to my Dad.
GORDO: C'mon, man. Get inside. I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
JOHN: No. I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
GORDO: Go in where?
JOHN: The warehouse. Buxton seeds. It's tomorrow.
GORDO: I know pal. I remember. Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
