Marshall's is a good resource for cheap shoes
I've seen a few posts about people looking for cheap high quality shoes, and I just wanted to share my results.  I've bought my last 2 pairs of shoes at Marshall's.  The first pair cost $8 a couple years ago and the second was $16 this weekend.  The first pair are essentially knockoff Converse All Stars from Lugz, and the second pair are similar but from Tommy Hilfiger. 

I don't need new shoes right now, but now I don't have to worry about finding a deal when my current pair eventually wears out.  I check the local Marshal's a couple times a month just to see what big sales might be going on.  Usually the really cheap shoes are down to the last pair and are the wrong size.  Marshall's is a good resource for super cheap business casual clothes too.
