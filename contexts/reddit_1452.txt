Does anyone else find job searches paralysing?
My (30F) anxiety has been around on and off for years. Most days it’s really manageable but as soon as it concerns finding a job, it goes off the charts. It’s as if something deep inside me is triggered and i experience panic attacks, shaking and vomiting. 
I don’t really know what I want to do with my life, career wise. I’ve jumped from job to job, not really liking anything for long periods of time. I stick with something for a while (because at first it’s fine) until I hate it so much I have to leave. And then I spiral, into a whirlpool of terror, shame and fear. 
Recently I found a job I really liked and then management changed and the new boss is awful. My anxious brain says she’s toxic but she’s honestly probably not THAT bad. But she has changed my job role enough that I’m no longer doing what I loved and am a glorified cleaner...so I know I have to leave. 
But after speaking to Mum last night about how I struggle to browse job ads because it’s so hard, she basically said “this happens all the time. You get bored of a job and then panic about finding a new one, you’re just going round and round in circles”. And that set off a middle of the night panic attack. I DONT know what I want to do with my life and I have no idea why the thought brings me such fear. Help?
