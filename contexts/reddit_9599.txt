Student Affairs Discord, anyone?
Hey there, I created a Student Affairs/Higher Education Discord when remote work took over, but unfortunately didn't share it very far. If anyone is interested in hopping on, please reach out to me. Mods of this sub: if any of you want to be admins for the server, please inbox me separately.

Edit: 
This was started for full timers in the field, but I'll expand it to include students in the field as well, in case it helps anyone get a foot in the door. 

Faculty (adjunct and full time) are also included, of course.

Once you get a role, you'll have access to a channel with others in your role. There's also a general channel, of course.
