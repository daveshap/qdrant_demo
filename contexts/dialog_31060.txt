DROP SHADOW: Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
REGGIE: United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
JOHNNIE: Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
REGGIE: Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
DROP SHADOW: He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
REGGIE: We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
