FINDLEY: Findley.
EDDIE: Glad to meet you.
FINDLEY: And I you. I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
EDDIE: Now and then. Why, do you?
FINDLEY: A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
BERT: So does Eddie.
EDDIE: Well, I win sometimes.
FINDLEY: I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
EDDIE: How much?
FINDLEY: Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.
BERT: Could be.
FINDLEY: Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
EDDIE: When?
FINDLEY: You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
EDDIE: That's right. When?
FINDLEY: Would you like to come out tonight?
EDDIE: What time?
FINDLEY: I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
BERT: We'll be there.
FINDLEY: Good, good.
SARAH: If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
EDDIE: Well, what's the matter?
SARAH: I'm a little tired.
