DANNY: What about chicken?
FIRST WAITER: That's meat.
DANNY: The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.
FIRST WAITER: Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
DANNY: But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
FIRST WAITER: No, I don't admit it's stupid.
DANNY: You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
FIRST WAITER: I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
DANNY: But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
FIRST WAITER: Steve...
DANNY: Steve's going to explain it.
