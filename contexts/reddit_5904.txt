Career choice: Engineering/Architecture OR Physician
Career choice: Engineering/Architecture OR Physician


Hi,

as the title suggests, I'm torn between these two fields. I'm set on beginning studying this fall, and don't know which one to choose. Below are pros and cons that I see. What do you think about this? 

**Engineering/Architecture:**

This programme is a double degree, in both Engineering and Architecture. 

Pros:

* I enjoy the creative and aesthetic aspect. I am almost certain I would be a good architect. 

* I have some sort of business vision

* I enjoy maths

* I enjoy building (construction)

Cons: 

* Worried I won't feel like I'm helping humanity/individuals; that I would lack meaning. 

* I worry that I might be mislead by the apparent praise/value/prestige a double degree is given, while I only value the engineering degree (apart from my appreciation for maths) as far as a merit to retreive higher positions and pay in future jobs. Solely a degree in architecture, I reason, would not be enough to speedily propel me toward my end goal (having my own business, being self-employed). 

* no higher purpose, other than the fact that I enjoy the ideation of living spaces. 




**Physician:**

Pros:

* Actually helping individuals on a daily basis; altruism; reducing the amount of suffering in the world.

* Opportunities for research, which could have a significant impact, and would probably feel meaningful.

* Working with people, as opposed to sitting behind a computer designing houses for the middle/-upper class. 

Cons:

* Lacks the creative aspect. (Might be wrong?)

* I haven't ever really been interested in neither chemistry nor biology in school. However, one's interests change through life. It is common that what once has been deemed uninteresting, later in life is discovered to be very interesting. My stated disinterest in chemistry and biology is not to be taken as completely true, as I'm not too familiar with the subjects, other than from high school, really. 

* (Difficult education. However, I am from Sweden so it's not as bad as in the US, same goes for working conditions)


Basically it is, as I see it, personal enjoyment with a struggle to find meaning VS. meaning with a struggle to find personal enjoyment. Which is preferable? Am I missing something? Any help/input would be highly appreciated. Thank you :)
