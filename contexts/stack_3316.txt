Book with a Troll girl, treeclub, with talking sun and castrated husband deserted father carcass? Anyone know of this book, I thought it was called The Last Simolean but it's like unexisted now?There's like an Amazon lady that bonks her head and like ends up a troll after being haunted by a talking sun, and a troll queen who uses her father's corpse.
