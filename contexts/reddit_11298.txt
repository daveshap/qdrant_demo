I don’t know what to do
Edit: I just wanted to express thanks for the encouraging words I was given in the comments of this post, they’ve meant a lot to me these past few days, thank you kind people 

I just moved back to my apartment from visiting home because my first day of my senior year of college starts in the morning. I was reluctant to leave because I kept having this funny feeling about going back. 

Since I got here several hours ago I keep crying because I’m so homesick and sad and I just want to go home more than anything. I miss my parents and my boyfriend so much and it really hurts. 

I’m scheduled for 35 hours at work this week which is going to put me behind on school work already on the first week of class. On top of that I don’t think I’m going to be able to keep up with my hectic schedule this semester. 

Feeling so sad and overwhelmed before school even starts gives me a bad feeling. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety problems before and I’m afraid this is the start of falling back into it which worries me. 

Despite how I feel it doesn’t seem like I can do anything about it since the semester is already paid for and my lease would still need be paid regardless of whether or not I moved home. I’m not even sure I’d be much happier moving home since living with my parents has its challenges. 

I guess the point of writing this was to get off my chest how unhappy I feel and to just acknowledge the fact that I have no clue what to do. 

Thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this whole thing. I hope I’ve been able to articulate myself well, but I fear my emotions have clouded my ability to communicate effectively. Anyway, thank you for reading my vent post.
