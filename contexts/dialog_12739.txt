TAUPIN: Fish are creatures of habit. They like their food where they're used to it. At the top, hiding in old leaves.
GRANDSON: Where did you learn that?
TAUPIN: My father taught me.
GRANDSON: Your father must be smart.
TAUPIN: Yes, he was.
TAUPIN: There was a man once. Just a simple woodcarver. But he understood. More than anyone he could see to the heart of it. It never ends. Today is the same as the first. Tomorrow will be the same as today. So much time. And all of it wasted. You love history?
BRENNA: Yes.
TAUPIN: I wish I could.
BRENNA: The estate stuff is pretty straight forward. Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
TAUPIN: It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
