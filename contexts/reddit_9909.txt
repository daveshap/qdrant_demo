Questions regarding admissions
This past semester i got in trouble at my 4 year college and got expelled. The charges are very serious and i am in the process of dealing with the felonies the university police have given me. I was academically dismissed instead of being expelled because i made a good impression at my conduct meeting with the school.

Since this has happened i have enrolled in summer school at my local community college. I have applied to transfer to some other schools and am waiting to hear back. I'm wondering what i should do from here. My motivation in my summer classes are non-existent and i don't know what to do anymore. Do you guys think i still have a shot at getting my degree at a four year school still? if so how should i go about doing this. Please help Reddit. Thank
