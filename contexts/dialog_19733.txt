NIXON: Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book. Six Crises.""
ROCKEFELLER: Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
NIXON: Some say you are, Rocky.
ROCKEFELLER: The Republican Party was never home to extremists. You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
ROCKEFELLER: Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's down from Harvard. On my staff, foreign policy whiz ...
NIXON: No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons. We have similar views on the balance of power ...
ROCKEFELLER: Well, that's wonderful. So get me this crisis" thing
NIXON: ... as the old alliances crumble.
KISSINGER: Finally someone who's noticed! I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon. You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill."
NIXON: Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli. They all went through the pain of losing power.
KISSINGER: But they all got it back again, didn't they? We should have lunch sometime.
NIXON: Rocky's full of shit! No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife. He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
MITCHELL: Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
NIXON: Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
MITCHELL: The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
NIXON: You're the one who should be in politics, John. You're tougher than I am. You never crack.
MITCHELL: That'll be the day.
NIXON: Let's get out of here; it's too painful. I hate it. We went bowling last weekend. Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
MITCHELL: Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
