MUNNY: Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
LITTLE BILL: Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
MUNNY: Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
LITTLE BILL: Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
MUNNY: I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
LITTLE BILL: You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
MUNNY: Like I said, I...
LITTLE BILL: What's your name?
MUNNY: Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
LITTLE BILL: Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
MUNNY: I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
LITTLE BILL: I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
MUNNY: Uh... yeah. Yeah.
LITTLE BILL: There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
MUNNY: Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
