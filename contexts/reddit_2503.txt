Am I going to bartend until I'm dead?
There isn't a job I want to do. If I didn't have to work I wouldn't. I have never gotten any satisfaction from working, I have simply done it to keep a roof over my head.  I think this is how I fell into bartending in the first place.

I moved across the country at 20 years old (2008 by the way) and realized "Life is hard when you're the one paying for it"  
Ended up in a bartending job because it was a way to make enough money to pay my bills and have some money left over for the actual enjoyable part of life.

Fast forward 11 years (31 now) and I'm still bartending. Where I'm working pays really well but I swear I'm dying on the inside. 

The problem is that I genuinely don't know how else to make a living out here. I live in CA and I can not reasonably afford to rent a place of my own (51% of my income just to cover the $1700 rent for a studio or maybe 1 bedroom if you're lucky) *with* my good paying bar job, so what else is there?

Am I missing something? Nothing really calls to me for a job, so is this it? Do I just bartend so that I have something to make an income off of for the rest of my life and just kinda die inside? There's no job that's calling to me. Hobbies and passions sure, but they require money to do anyway and you don't get paid to do them. Not as inexperienced as I am either.

I don't know, it feels like life is really hollow and I don't see a way around it. Have you been here before?  Am I missing something? I'm so tired inside
