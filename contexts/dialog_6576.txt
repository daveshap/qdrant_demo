RUTH: She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
LETTY: Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
RUTH: How?
LETTY: I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too. A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
RUTH: Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
LETTY: Maybe.
RUTH: You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
LETTY: Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
RUTH: Please, Letty.
LETTY: Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
LETTY: Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
RUTH: Really?
LETTY: You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
RUTH: And the party?
LETTY: Yeah, it'll be fun.
