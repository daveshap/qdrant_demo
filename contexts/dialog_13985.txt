MARYLIN: It's a no go, Joe.
MILES: Marylin!
MARYLIN: It's okay Joe.
MILES: Wait! He works for YOU?
MARYLIN: Now. But first, he worked for you.
MILES: You were going to have this thug...?
MARYLIN: Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
JOE: You're calling me a pestilence? That's a hoot!
MARYLIN: I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds. Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
MILES: Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
MARYLIN: That's true.
JOE: Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
MARYLIN: Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
