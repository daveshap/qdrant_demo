Quick advice needed about sending an email to new boss
I'm still in the training phase and am now moving onto the on floor training for a week. This is a part time job thats supposed to be for 3 days bit the trainings are occurring 5 days a week. I emailed the director yesterday (who handles initial training and first schedules) about how i'm done with the administrative part and would like to move onto on the floor. 

She told me to come in tomorrow (today), friday saturday mon and tues. I have mentioned previously to literally everyone in HR that I have a second job and need to be aware of this before hand to handle coverage etc. Additionally because I took off for a week at work already its harder to find coverage because I left then hanging for a week (annoying because they weren't even sympathetic enough to let me take off for my dads surgery). 

I'm at my 2nd job right now and genuinely cannot work until MAYBE Sunday at the earliest and have mentioned to the person dealing woth scheduling that i had weekends and mon/tue even for training because unfortunately my other job has become a little inflexible. 

I did send an email yesterday, telling them my dad is in the hospital and would appreciate to start on sunday/monday because he'll discharge then, but she never replied and would like feedback on how to approach this now...
