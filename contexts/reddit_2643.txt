Am I scaring off employers when i tell them what I currently earn? How do you properly answer "Whats your expected salary" question?
Ive been doing freelance for more than a year now and I earn so much more compared to when I was in full time. Now im looking for a full time job but cant seem to land a job. Some are giving me offers but are super low. 

Some I dont even get a second interview cause im sure its because I tell them what i currently earn. I always say its "negotiable" cause the setup for full time is very different. 

How should I properly answer what my expected salary is? Some jobs on indeed they show their salary range. Should i just stick to that? To be honest, now im just desperate to just land a job. But i want to also be given the best offer.
