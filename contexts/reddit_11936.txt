I have been feeling like crap
I don't know, I know depression runs in my family and it could just be that but, I feel like breaking down constantly. It's to the point that it gets in the way of just doing simple tasks like homework. I'm always tired. I just don't want to do anything, I do want to get out of bed and just go out but, it's so cold and I can't. So I just stay home and feel bad for myself even though I know I have life magnitudes better than many people. I don't know, I just need to vent.

Thanks for reading.
