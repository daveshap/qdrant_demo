CROSS: You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
GITTES: Thanks.
CROSS: If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
GITTES: It doesn't hurt.
CROSS: It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
GITTES: Probably.
CROSS: But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
GITTES: No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
CROSS: How did she get that idea?
GITTES: I think I gave it to her.
