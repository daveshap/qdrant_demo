MADOX: And where are the Expedition Maps?
ALMÁSY: In my room.
MADOX: Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government. They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
ALMÁSY: What's the matter with you?
MADOX: Don't be so bloody naïve. You know there's a war breaking out. This arrived this morning. By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
ALMÁSY: Why do they care about our maps?
MADOX: What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears. In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
ALMÁSY: Own the desert.
