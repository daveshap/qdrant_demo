GROUCHO: So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
MRS. TEASDALE: But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit... He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
GROUCHO: Let him patch up his own breeches...
TRENTINO: I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
GROUCHO: Forget? You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
TRENTINO: I am willing to apologize... I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
GROUCHO: Nothing doing!! I've taken a lease on the battlefield. I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
VERA: Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
GROUCHO: Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
MRS. TEASDALE: Oh, won't you reconsider...
GROUCHO: Well, maybe I am a little headstrong... But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me.
TRENTINO: What I called you... Why, what did I call you?
GROUCHO: I don't remember.
TRENTINO: Oh -- you mean... worm?
GROUCHO: No, that wasn't it...
TRENTINO: Was it -- swine?
GROUCHO: No... it was a seven letter word.
TRENTINO: Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
GROUCHO: That's it...
TRENTINO: Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage! This man is impossible... My course is clear... this means war... You RUNT!
GROUCHO: I still like UPSTART the best.
