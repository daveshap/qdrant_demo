JACK: Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
PARRY: Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
JACK: Yes. I think that's very fair.
JACK: .....What are you doing?
PARRY: Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
JACK: You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
PARRY: Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
JACK: NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts. This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
JACK: ..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
PARRY: Who are you talking to Jack?
JACK: YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
PARRY: Bingo!
