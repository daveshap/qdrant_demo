HECTOR: They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans. Tranq him in water, he drowns.
KELLY: They could try to tranq him on land.
HECTOR: They won't. He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
KEOUGH: Gee, that would really disappoint me.
HECTOR: Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine. This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>. An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
JACK: Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
HECTOR: I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out. And I think I know a way to--
JACK: <u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
HECTOR: Look. I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it. They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
