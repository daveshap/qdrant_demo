LULA: That you, Sail, honey?
SAILOR: The only one.
LULA: You find any work?
SAILOR: Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
LULA: I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
SAILOR: You sick?
LULA: A little, I think... Darlin'?
SAILOR: Yeah?
LULA: Come sit by me.
