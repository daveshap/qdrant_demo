Impulsively asked a girl out for the first time ever.
Sup people.

I (M23) have no dating experience. I asked a girl on a date very suddenly tonight (over FBâ€”I don't see her in person and I don't have her number). 

I've been thinking about asking her for a while but never built up the nerve to do it. Dunno why I did tonight.

(Edit: YES, I know her. Yes, we have texted before. Yes, we chatted before I asked.)

Gentlest rejection I could have asked for for my first time. I thanked her for letting me down easy, we carried on chatting, and now we're hitting up a cafe as friends.

Did not expect that.

I realize not all rejections are as easy as this, but I wanted to share. I'm glad I asked her. 

I don't think this sub will ever have enough JUST DO THE THING posts. So there you go.
