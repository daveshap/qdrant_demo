hard to be a man with a depression
no one cares. no single one. gives fuck about you. especially after 25+. no single fucks given. you worth nothing. unworthy piece of shit. can't even suicide. stuck. wish to be dead instead. got defeated in all ways. thousand times. have no single hope. dreams start to become more real and pleasure if you don't have nightmares instead. hate everyone around you. hate life. slow death. nobody would ever care. everything is lie. fake support. fake therapy. agendas for money. screwing people up to the riches.
