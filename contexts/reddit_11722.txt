I don't think I'm capable of loving another person.
Well, the title pretty much says it all.

Now, I have my family, friends, and acquaintances, but I honestly don't think "love" applies to any of them. Think about how hard it is to say "I don't love my parents" (not to them of course) when they didn't do anything to deserve that. I alternate feeling like a monster and a broken person.

And even though my previous plans included marriage as a prospect, that seems impossible now. I couldn't care for anyone the way I perceive married couples should. My previous romantic encounters have supported that opinion pretty well, too.

So there you have it. I might was well be a sociopath.
