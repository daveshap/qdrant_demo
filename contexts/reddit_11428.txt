"just leave the tray, its their job to clean"
This morning as my mom and I left the front door to my apartment to take the elevator down., We came across a huge dump of cardboard boxes and junk just sprawled at the lobby. Someone was too lazy to bring them all downstairs to the big garbage bins. Clearly it was thrown out for someone (cleaners) to clear, but it isn't their primary job. 

I said to my mom how inconsiderate the person is and how bad I felt for the cleaners who have to clean their mess just to mop the area. Mom just laughed and replied "its fine, You got to give them a job to do." Needless to say, I didn't bother trying to argue and started my day off irritated. 

Mind you, she would YELL at me ever since I was young whenever I would attempt to clean the table and bring my fast food tray to the collection shelf. "It's dirty" "the cleaners won't have a job". I still can't bring my head over how people can say that without thinking twice. Sure it's their job, but man it doesn't mean you can't be a decent human being and clean up after yourself.
