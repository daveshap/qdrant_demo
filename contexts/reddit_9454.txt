I'll Finally Be Able to Go to College
I am ecstatic. I'm 23 and have been working to go to college since I was a teenager, but life got thrown at me hard this last year and I thought it was never going to happen. I was working a job that cost me $60 A day to get to and from (partially blind, can't drive, it was in another city, had to Uber/Lyft). And working a second job where I walked 6 miles a day to get to/from.


Recently, I got a new job while still working the 6 mile walk job. I should start next week (and will be working enough I can just work the one) and it costs me less than half of what the $60 A day job cost me to get to and from. It still sucks that I have to pay to get there, but I'm hoping I can move closer in a few months by subletting my apt. The best part? They'll pay part of my tuition in a few months for an associates and bachelor's, as long as it's in a business-related field (I wanted to go for IT, anyway). I thought I was never going to be able to go to school and get a better job, and I'm so happy.
