DWAYNE: What are you saying?
SALLY: I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
DWAYNE: Watch that. Watch that tone.
EARL: I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
BOOTH: All right enough! I'm tired of thinking about all this!
EARL: Well I'm not! Thinks he's got us by the balls.
BOOTH: Well doesn't he? Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now. Just call it the cost of doing business. This whole thing is screwed up. I'm thinking. Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
BOOTH: ...Or get rid of the money. I don't know.
EARL: I've got a better idea. All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
BOOTH: And how do you figure we do that?
EARL: All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape. We'll set him up somehow.
BOOTH: He's probably made copies. He's not going to give them up to us.
EARL: Forget the copies! He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
EARL: He's going to be trouble.
BOOTH: He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
