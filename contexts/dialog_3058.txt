BATMAN: Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
ROBIN: What are you talking about?
BATMAN: Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
ROBIN: A poison kiss? You have some real issues with women, you know that? You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me. Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours. Could you?!
