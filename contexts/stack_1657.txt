Interrupt during packet transfer I'm using the mbed TCP/IP Socket library to receive incoming messages via ethernet. Currently, the incoming data is read in an infinite while(1) loop (i.e. as fast as possible). I will also be adding several timer interrupt functions which run periodically (1000/sec). Should an interrupt occur while a message is being received, would the incoming message be discarded and have to be re-sent from the client?How are packets processed in the LPC1768? If I process incoming packages in a separate timer interrupt function (say, 20/sec), can I still guarantee that packets won't be missed?
