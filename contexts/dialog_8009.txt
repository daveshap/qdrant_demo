ED: Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in.
SHARI: What do we have to do?
ED: My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV.
ED: But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV. Hah?
SHARI: So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
