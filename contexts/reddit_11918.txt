My apartment is awful.
I just signed a lease on a new apartment. The landlord wouldn't let me see it, as it wasn't in show able condition, instead showing me a similar unit (not a model). Today, I went to visit and noticed the door was unlocked. To put it lightly, I was horrified. The place was trashed (there was literal poo on the floor) and in generally disgusting condition. Now, I know that the floors will be replaced, walls painted, etc. what I'm most worried about are the things that won't be switched- the hideous tile in the bathroom, the mismatched appliances, etc. The apartment I saw was nice. The one I'm getting is horrid and not comparable. I don't know what to do.
