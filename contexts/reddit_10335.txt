i almost killed myself
but i didn’t. 

yay? i guess?

i almost drove off the cliff. i was so close to doing it. but i sat in my car and i screamed, 

“JUST GO HOME. JUST GO HOME. JUST GO HOME. JUST GO HOME.”

until i made it home. and then i sat in my driveway and sobbed.

when i went inside, i broke down in front of my roommates and had a severe panic attack and my roommate just rubbed my back and helped me breath.

the next day, my best friend took me out to eat. i told her i almost did it. and she said “i could tell a few days before that you were off. and i didn’t say anything. i’m sorry, i should have. i didn’t want you to feel like i was smothering you.” 

but it just meant a lot that she noticed and that i could talk to her about it. 

i have a great support system, but i’m just living with this mental illness. it hurts. my life is so good, but i’m just sick.
