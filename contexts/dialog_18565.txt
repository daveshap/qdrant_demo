VICTORIA: Duty?! You talk about duty?!
BROWN: If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
VICTORIA: I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
BROWN: Have I ever let you down before--?
VICTORIA: -- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
BROWN: I'm breaking no promises!
VICTORIA: You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
BROWN: For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
VICTORIA: I will not hear any more about my safety!! You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
BROWN: -- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...! All I've ever thought about is you!
VICTORIA: Then why send me back to them?!
BROWN: Because I have to!
