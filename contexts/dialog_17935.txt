WITWER: I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
ANDERTON: The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
WITWER: But you call this room the temple"."
ANDERTON: Just a nickname.
WITWER: The oracle isn't where the power is anyway. The power's always been with the priests. Even if they had to invent the oracle.
ANDERTON: You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
JAD: Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
ANDERTON: Uh-huh. Jad?
JAD: Sir?
ANDERTON: Go back to work. All of you.
WITWER: Sorry. Old habit. I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop. My father was a minister. Lutheran.
ANDERTON: What does he think of your chosen line of work?
WITWER: I don't know. He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
