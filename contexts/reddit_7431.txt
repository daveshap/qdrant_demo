Advice on Feeling Inadequate?
I'm starting my MS in fall and have been trying to learn as much about the current events and goings on of the program as possible - following them on social media, reading the laboratory blogs highlighting student research - and I can't get away from the feeling that my own research, once I start, will never be as good or novel or useful as everyone that I'm reading about. Maybe it's because a lot of them are in the labs that I'll be joining or that I'm worried about starting grad school with covid measures still in place (I suck at online classes).

On top of that I'm going to my MS right after graduating undergrad and I keep being told not to worry that I'm 'just doing an MS' like there's something wrong with not going straight to PhD. I'm genuinely excited for my program and the project I've discussed with my advisors but I just wish I knew how to stop feeling like I'm never going to be enough and that the other students in my lab will look down on me for not being as good as they are.
