I find myself crying more in public spontaneously
It's happened before when I was starting to work years ago but at least I could hold it a bit until finding a place to hide and cry, but now it could happen anywhere. I can barely hold myself together enough to not tear when family visits. Or in the line on the market, or in a restaurant. Yesterday I just started fully crying on the street and obviously people stared at me. 

It's humiliating. And I can't control it.

I'll have to learn to calm myself though. Please don't give suggestions, possitive thinking has never worked for me, it actually makes me feel worse.
