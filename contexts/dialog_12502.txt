BERNIE: Anticipation of incarceration"?"
DONNA: He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
BERNIE: I know what he means. I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day. I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake! Maybe I augment" my income a little with some "business deals
DONNA: I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
BERNIE: He gives a good report and I walk?
DONNA: We can hope. You still have your job, right?
BERNIE: Yeah, I been calling in sick. They think I got the flu.
DONNA: And a son by your ex-wife? Joseph.
BERNIE: A son, yeah. What about him? Joey.
DONNA: Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
BERNIE: Involved! Christ! She attached my goddamn paycheck! Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer? You know what I mean. Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
DONNA: I understand. How often do you see your son?
BERNIE: Often, uh.
DONNA: How recently?
BERNIE: Uh, his birthday, uh, May. I think.
DONNA: It's November.
BERNIE: She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
DONNA: I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job. You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
DONNA: Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
BERNIE: Some of it. Right here. I got some of it. I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
