Do any of our satellites or space exploration craft need or use relativity for strictly navigational purposes? I thought I read somewhere that everything we've ever sent into space used only Newton for navigation, because relativistic effects are orders of magnitude smaller than other causes of course deviation.But now I can't find it. Now all I can find is articles about probes testing various aspects of relativity--but nothing about whether relativity was necessary for navigation, beyond the needs of the experiment.Do we need relativity for navigating the solar system?
