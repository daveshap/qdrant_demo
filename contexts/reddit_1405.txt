People wished me a happy birthday this year!
# Last year, I made a post here,  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8ltlf/can\_someone\_wish\_me\_a\_happy\_birthday/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8ltlf/can_someone_wish_me_a_happy_birthday/) because nobody wished me a happy birthday last year.

This year, I'm happy to say that I've grown out of my comfort zone and I've made some friends in school, and they've wished me a happy birthday! It's been the best birthday i've had in a long time, and i feel I've came a long way in terms of my anxiety and in terms of my social skills since i made that post, and I really appreciate those of you who sent a message this year wishing me a happy birthday, it's much appreciated! Thank you all so much!
