JAEGER: Jesus! What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis. Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
WES: Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North. Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
EPPS: They're doing more than slapping.
JAEGER: The Shi'ites are on our side? I didn't know that.
WES: Is there anything you do know?
JAEGER: I know you're a pussy. I know that.
EPPS: All right. Let's get out of here.
WES: The soldiers are going to kill those people!
JAEGER: So?
WES: We have to do something.
EPPS: There's nothing we can do.
WES: We can fight. That's what we're here for: To fight the Iraqis. To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
