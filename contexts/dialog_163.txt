EDDIE: She's fucked. Even if that story is true.
JORDY: Raw deal.
JORDY: Look - let me talk to her. Any leads I get, they're all yours. Just let me have a first crack at her.
EDDIE: You wanna talk to her alone?
JORDY: Yeah.
EDDIE: What would your girlfriend think of that?
JORDY: I don't have a girlfriend.
EDDIE: My point exactly.
JORDY: I'm serious here.
EDDIE: So am I.
JORDY: C'mon. You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity. She sees me differently.
EDDIE: You're her Savior? Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
JORDY: You know what I'm saying here.
EDDIE: Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start. You take her to the station house. Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
JORDY: Hey. I'm a professional.
EDDIE: Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
OLEG: Gotta light the scene better. Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
EMIL: Shut up.
OLEG: Does it hurt?
