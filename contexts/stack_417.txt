I used the updater on ubuntu 14.04 and when I restarted, it still shows 14.04 and Chromium no longer works, how do I get 16.04? I have a Dell Inspiron 3552 that came with ubuntu 14.04.  I used the updater to get updates (hoping to get 16.04) and when I restarted the computer, following the prompts, it still showed version 14.04 and Chromium no longer works.  how do I get the 16.04 version and should I scrap Chromium and download another browser?
