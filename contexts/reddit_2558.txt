How to quit a job without telling the truth?
So I've just been offered a job today in a different company and I am really scared of telling my manager/CEO the truth of why I will be leaving.

So our company is quite small - growing moderately - and without sounding big headed, I have helped the company grow a lot. I know they really need me and my skills as a designer, however my manager takes most of the credit of my work, therefore he is getting promoted more than me (I also get the fact he is the manager) and instead I have received a small salary increase instead.

Anyways, the manager treats me like crap most of the time, our boss can also be horrible and demands the best quality of work with the shortest amount of time possible (so working OT/working over weekends) and if you don't deliver, you're just not good enough for their company. My manager has honestly been horrible to me, even the staff in different departments commented on how he speaks to me.

My notice period is a month, and I know for a fact he's going to be so horrible when I tell him I will be moving to a different company (sort of a competitor too), and I'm just not willing to sit through for a month of hell. He's currently been nice because one of our ex assistant had left a horrible glassdoor review of working for the company.

What should I do? Should I lie that I'm leaving the city to go back home? I know he will be constantly asking and prying for the rest of my notice period so I can't exactly say 'I can't tell you/I don't need to tell you'.

Help/advice will be appreciated!

Thank you.

Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, I was hoping to get 1 or 2 advices. Thank you so much for all your replies, it's helped me feel more confident to hand in my notice tomorrow! Nervous still - but I'm going to do it!
