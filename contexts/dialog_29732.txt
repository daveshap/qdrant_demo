HARRY: Why did you continue to see him?
HELEN: He needed my help.
HARRY: Not because you were attracted to him?
HELEN: No.
HARRY: You weren't attracted to him at all?
HELEN: Well, maybe a little.
GIB: Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
HELEN: No! Never!
GIB: So, it was your first time.
HELEN: I wasn't cheating!
HARRY: Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
HELEN: Harry? What can I say about Harry? He's a sales rep for a computer company.
HARRY: Would you say he was boring, then?
HELEN: Yeah. I suppose he is.
