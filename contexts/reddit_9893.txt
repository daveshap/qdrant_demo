How competitive are assistantships?
How hard is it to get into a higher education master's program and get an assistantship? I'll be applying to schools with a year of tutoring college students under my belt, but that's about it. Is it likely that I could get an assistantship with not much experience or do people generally have to be more involved in that type of stuff as an undergrad to be competitive?
