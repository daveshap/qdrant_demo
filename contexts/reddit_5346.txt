Hurt at work, failed drug test, EAP programs
I got hurt at work last Friday, slightly my fault more of my supervisors fault. ( he left the Machine We were working on running as he made adjustments, didn’t follow lock out tag out procedures) But they decided to drug test me on Monday. I failed the drug test because I couldn’t pee. (I’m on antibiotics that caused a UTI. Peeing on command is impossible right now.) I peed the first time and the nurse told me the temperature didn’t read, fine sit down and try again in an hour, I peed right under the line that they accepted and the temperature still didn’t register. Okay fine tried a third time, I drank a bunch of water but alas I wasn’t able to pee. 

My job know I USED to smoke CBD, I quit a while ago and have tried home tests and they came out clean so I know I would have peed clean. But whatever I took the fail, got suspended for three days (all after I submitted a claim with L&I). I had a meeting with my plant manager yesterday and they want me to sign a last chance agreement. 

I’m slightly confused by this agreement. I have to get in contact with a Employee Assistance Program case worker before I return to work. Does that mean they are going to make me go to rehab or counseling? I’m alright with getting randomly drug tested for the next year as I know I’ll come up clean. I’m just slightly annoyed if I have to go into a treatment for a problem I don’t have. I know I can get another job but I like my profession and the people I work with. I just would like to know what to expect.

I’m also annoyed my supervisor didn’t get drug tested, I thought everyone involved in the accident had to be tested. (I could be wrong)

Anyway, thanks for reading!

Edit: if I didn’t flair this right I apologize!
