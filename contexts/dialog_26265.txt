ARTIE: Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
GILLIS: Close, but no cigar.
ARTIE: Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days, are you?
GILLIS: Where's the bar?
GILLIS: Good party.
ARTIE: The greatest. They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors. Hey, easy on the punch bowl. Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
GILLIS: Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
ARTIE: Sure, this'll go on all night.
GILLIS: I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
ARTIE: It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
GILLIS: I'll take it.
ARTIE: I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
