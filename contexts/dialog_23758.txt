MAC: Absolutely true. Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
MAC: You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
JANET: If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
MAC: He will. But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings. You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous. And Farley's given you that chance. You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
