BOBO: I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
LILLY: It'll never happen again. I swear.
BOBO: It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.

BOBO: You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
LILLY: No.
BOBO: I'll loan you a raincoat.
