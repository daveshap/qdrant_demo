DEAN: They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
JERRY: Did they take your clothes?
DEAN: No.
JERRY: You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
DEAN: No.
JERRY: Usually they take clothes.
DEAN: Why don't you give 'em a call.
JERRY: What about jewelry?
DEAN: They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
JERRY: The blender?
DEAN: I love my blender.
JERRY: They didn't take the silverware?
DEAN: No, but they took my blender.
JERRY: Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
DEAN: What?
JERRY: They only took electrical appliances.
DEAN: Serve the ball.
