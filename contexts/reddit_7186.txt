How relevant are CompTIA Certifications in today's business world?
Hey Everybody,

A few weeks ago I was laid off due to the current pandemic and have decided to use my free time for things that are more productive. I was thinking of maybe starting towards my CompTIA certifications, beginning with the Core 3 of A+, Network+ and Security+. 

Would not mind getting into PenTesting later on down the road, but my question is, if I were to put the time to study for the A+ test first (and then work my way up), would the certification increase my chances of getting better pay? My current experience is in customer service, mostly entry-level stuff, usually between $14.00 to $16.00 per hour.

I'm in the United States. Based on the job postings I'm seeing it looks like this certification could help me land jobs in the $20.00 per hour range, but I wanted to know how the certification fit into the bigger picture, maybe get some different viewpoints.

I would like to go back to school and get a degree in something, but for now I need to concentrate on staying self-sufficient. Computers have been second-nature to me, and I've helped others build theirs, so the tech stuff doesn't seem to be too much of a problem.

Thoughts? Thanks.
