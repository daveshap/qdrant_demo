iPad mail swoosh sound gone missing An iPad running iOS 12 has lost its swoosh!Apple Mail would make a swoosh sound when mail was sent.  But a couple of days ago it stopped.  The sound is on, (not muted.) I go to sounds > sent mail classic etc and can hear the swoosh no problem, but not when I actually send mail.  Nor if I change the sent mail sound to one of the other sound options.iPad volume, and sent mail sounds are the only solutions I have found, but do not apply.  Is there anything else to try?Edit - I now see that lots of systems sounds are not working.  Lock and keyboard are set to green but do not make system sound. All volumes are set to max.  Anything else to try?
