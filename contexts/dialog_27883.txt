HAMMER: Okay, what's the information?
TIKVA: She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
HAMMER: Anything else?
TIKVA: Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
HAMMER: But we're not open on Sundays.
TIKVA: I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
HAMMER: I'll be in my office.
