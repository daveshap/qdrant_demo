DOROTHEA: Flesh is a trap. That's what he used to say. Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free. Why did you come back?
HARRY: I didn't leave. I was just digging around.
DOROTHEA: What did you find?
HARRY: Jennifer Desiderio, for one. She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
DOROTHEA: Oh Christ.
HARRY: Why don't you tell me the truth?
HARRY: Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
DOROTHEA: It was more than that, I think.
HARRY: He was the real thing, right?
DOROTHEA: Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
HARRY: Stuff?
DOROTHEA: He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things. And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
HARRY: He taught all this to Swann?
DOROTHEA: Some or it.
HARRY: So Swann was performing magic. not illusions? And what? You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
DOROTHEA: I told you --
HARRY: Too much fame. Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
DOROTHEA: No.
HARRY: You said you weren't with him for love.
DOROTHEA: I wasn't.
HARRY: What then?
DOROTHEA: I was grateful to him. I owed him my life. And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
HARRY: He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
