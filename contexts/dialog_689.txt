ROSE: Do you have to be so brutal?
KORSHUNOV: Yes
ROSE: Why? Do you enjoy it?
KORSHUNOV: I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
ROSE: How can you? I mean they're people.
KORSHUNOV: But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
ROSE: That was war.
KORSHUNOV: So is this. Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
ALICE: The woman you shot. She was my friend.
KORSHUNOV: That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
