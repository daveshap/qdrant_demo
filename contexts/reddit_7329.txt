What jobs can you train for at nights/weekends?
I work during the week during normal business hours. Seems like itâ€™s hard to find training or classes for other career fields during nights and/or weekends. Any ideas? I would also like to avoid careers where you could spend a bunch of money/time on classes or training without much of a guarantee afterward, been down that road before. Any ideas would be appreciated.
