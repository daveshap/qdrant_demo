COOCH: Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
RAY: When did we get that?
COOCH: Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
RAY: -- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
COOCH: You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
RAY: I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
COOCH: Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
RAY: I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
COOCH: Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
RAY: Alright. Alright...
COOCH: Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
