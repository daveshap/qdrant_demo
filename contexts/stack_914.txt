Update Software proposes an upgrade to ubuntu 18.04 even if it is a 32bits netbook If UBUNTU discarded the 32bits old machines, how come Software Updater tool suggesta and  pushes to upgrade my 32bits netbook from ubuntu 16.04 to 18.04?   I did it once and the netbook got stuck in the login procedure, it ask for password and it seems to log in but it returns to the password request again (no msg of incorrect password).
