CHARLIE: Oh Michael, look...
MICHAEL: Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
CHARLIE: Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...? Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
MICHAEL: All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of. I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
CHARLIE: We'll settle it tonight.
