Are there any resources to help afford purchasing a new laptop?
I have a friend who's a fellow graduate student, and the computer he's had for over five years has stopped working completely, but he doesn't have the money to spend a few hundred on a new one.


Are there any places he could turn to for help? I know there are student discounts available with various tech businesses, but it's usually something like 10% off purchases. Are there any sort of grants for necessary technology (we're in a programming-heavy math program, so a working laptop is pretty much mandatory), or student- focused charities, or anything else that could help cover some of the costs of a new purchase? Or a place where he could maybe get some old used laptop? I'd give him my old one, but it's in such bad shape it can't even go online anymore. He's also not a U.S. citizen, so I don't know if that could help in some way.
