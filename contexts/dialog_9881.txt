CLAIRE: Hi Frances, got a minute?
FRANCES: Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
CLAIRE: Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
FRANCES: My clothes?
CLAIRE: Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
FRANCES: It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
CLAIRE: Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
FRANCES: I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
CLAIRE: You know what I mean.
FRANCES: Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
