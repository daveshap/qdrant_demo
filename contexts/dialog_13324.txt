GABRIELLE: Shall we close up, then?
NATHAN: Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
GABRIELLE: It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
NATHAN: Yes. Happy happy.
GABRIELLE: Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
NATHAN: I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
GABRIELLE: I am sleepy.
NATHAN: I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
GABRIELLE: Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
NATHAN: Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
GABRIELLE: Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
NATHAN: It's true. I wouldn't lie.
GABRIELLE: You are sweet.
