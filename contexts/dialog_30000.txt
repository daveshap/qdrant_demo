JAKE: What can I do for you, lad?
BOBBY: I was hoping we could talk.
JAKE: Talk? About what?
BOBBY: About things. About your wife.
JAKE: Sweet Grace? What about her?
BOBBY: About what you said this morning.
BOBBY: You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife. Fifty-thousand dollars.
JAKE: I do.
BOBBY: You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
JAKE: I did?
BOBBY: Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
JAKE: Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
BOBBY: I'm not rambling.
JAKE: You're talking like a madman.
BOBBY: Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
JAKE: Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off. I don't want anybody dead.
BOBBY: Bullshit. You wanted me to kill her.
JAKE: A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
BOBBY: You meant it.
JAKE: What makes you say that?
BOBBY: Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
JAKE: And what does that make you?
BOBBY: The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you... You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
JAKE: Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
BOBBY: You love her, but you hate her?
JAKE: No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath
