PEARL: ...I've seen things. In there. Last night. You did too. Don't tell me you didn't. You were crying like a baby.
CINNABAR: You said the vision, the images. They're just that. Just pictures. They can't hurt you. That's what you always said.
PEARL: I lied.
CINNABAR: All the more reason I should be here.
PEARL: Please. It's for your own good.
CINNABAR: You said bad things hurt places. So maybe good things heal them. Good things are happening here. Maybe for the first time ever. And maybe that's all it takes.
