HAGEN: When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
DON CORLEONE: Mention it, don't insist. Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
HAGEN: You mean Tattaglia.
DON CORLEONE: Barzini.
HAGEN: He was the one behind Sollozzo?
DON CORLEONE: Tattaglia is a pimp. He could never have outfought Santino. But I wasn't sure until this day. No, it was Barzini all along.
MICHAEL: Don Tommassino.
DON TOMMASSINO: Michael, why must you do this. We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret. It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
MICHAEL: Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
DON TOMMASSINO: You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
MICHAEL: I know.
DON TOMMASSINO: Where are you going?
MICHAEL: Corleone.
DON TOMMASSINO: There is nothing there. Not anymore.
MICHAEL: I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
DON TOMMASSINO: Long ago. Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
MICHAEL: Don Tommassino...I should see this place.
DON TOMMASSINO: That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
MICHAEL: No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
