Find significance between two group proportions My question is the following: what statistical test would I use to compare the proportion of participants between two groups. For example, if in 2009, 20% of participants ( population was 55) to a competition were students, and in 2019, 50% of participants (population was 99) were students, how can I show that's a significant increase? I am given the sample sizes.
