You ever just make out with someone and think fuck when is this gonna be over?
I don’t know if this is normal. It happens even when I kiss/make out with someone I like. Granted I’ve never kissed someone I REALLY REALLY like but I don’t know if I’m even going to feel anything if I do. Is there something wrong with me?
