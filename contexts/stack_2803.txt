Snow flake symmetry and angle of water molecule I read in various places (e.g. Feynman Lectures) that the bonding angle of water molecules (ca 105 degrees) is related to the 6-fold symmetry of snow flakes. I understand that in ice, the water molecules are arranged in a lattice, but how does the angle of 105 degrees match the interior angles of a hexagon (120 degrees)?Do the water molecules in a lattice distort their angles to 120 degrees or is something else going on?
