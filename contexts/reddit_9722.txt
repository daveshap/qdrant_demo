Grad student and new to the field now unsure about SA/Higher Ed careers
Hello. I am a graduate student in a higer education about half way through my first semester. I am doing well in the sense that so far all my grades have been very high or perfect, but I have been really stressing and obsessing over my future (which is making focusing on studying and doing my homework very difficult) and the possibility of either never landing a job or getting a job and not lasting long in this field due to ill fitting. A bit about me, after graduation(10 years ago) I had a long bout of unemployment and underemployment followed by caring for my dad as he eventually succumbed to cancer over the course of two years. To be frank, I had issues getting any kind of work due to my unemployment gaps and since I was always passionate about learning and education, I thought Higher Education admin might be a good fit for me; so, I applied and entered a program.  I can't stop thinking about how I am the only person without experience in my class and that I'm just going to end up flunking out or graduating and not having a career. That feeling of boredom and worthlessness unemployment gives me scares the fuck out of me and I can't survive it again.
