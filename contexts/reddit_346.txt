I have two Options but I need help please help
So I’m in this pen pal program there’s two days of it, 30 kids from my school and 30 from other school. The first day past, as I was paired with a girl who is amazing and genuine(I’m a junior and she’s a senior). She had to follow my high school schedule from period 3 to 6. We had such a great time and became close friends, and we were excited for the second day, which is a month away, to see each other where I follow her schedule and meet new people. 

HOWEVER on that same day I have an Over-Night trip for my orchestra(This is the top orchestra in the high school) and I’m the most important one. I play bass and the other two bass players can’t go because they don’t want to. That day we’ll play for fun and professional would give us advice. Then we’ll go watch the New York philharmonics and visit Fredonia for a college tour. My good friend is going but she knows no one and really wants me to go on the trip(Btw I’m a guy). I don’t want her to be alone for the two days.

I don’t know what to do, picking one just gives me guilt towards the other. What do you guys think would be the best thing to do?
