New job, Getting discouraged.
I know this post gets made relatively frequently, but I graduated college in December, started work in January, and am getting discouraged.


I work in an engineering role that is very technical. I started work at a very busy time and got thrown into a very poorly managed project with a very tight deadline. I have recieved mininal training, and it is hard to ask my coworkers for help and it hampers their progress towards our short deadline. I did well in school and at my internships, so im not used to being in this spot. Im trying my best but im getting discouraged with how difficult the project im working on is. I recieved much better training at my internships and i feel like i am set up to fail here. 

Looking for some words of encouragement or advice.
