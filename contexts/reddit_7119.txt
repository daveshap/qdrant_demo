Would Paul Feldmanâ€™s bagel business strategy be a possible side hustle for a 20 yr old college student?
If you've read the book Freakonomics then I'm sure you're familiar with what business I'm talking about. However, if you aren't familiar with Paul Feldman and his bagel business, [here's](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/magazine/what-the-bagel-man-saw.html) an article that talks about it briefly. Basically what Feldman does is buys bagels in the morning, leaves them in various offices with a collection box asking for one dollar per bagel, and comes back later during lunch time to collect the boxes. For anyone that is unfamiliar it might sound crazy, but it was actually a wildly successful business. He was able to quit his full time job and earn more than he ever did just by depending on peoples' honesty to leave money for the bagels. I believe that he still continues his business to this day in Washington.

A few things to note about myself. I just turned 20 years old, in college, have a part-time job, and just looking for side hustles while in school. I was primarily thinking about targeting elementary, middle, and high school faculty in my district with this bagel service. Leave 2 or 3 boxes of bagels and a collection box in each school's faculty lounge (if they allow it).

My concern isn't so much as to whether people will be honest enough in order for the business to be profitable (Feldman showed that honesty didn't hold the business back from being profitable through meticulous data collection), but rather if breaking into this kind of side hustle is viable or not. Will the startup cost outweigh the profits? Will the risk outweigh the profits? Will it be hard finding clients that are willing to do business? Is this just as a side hustle too much?

I know these questions don't have definitive answers, but I'd like to hear other people's opinions on the matter.
