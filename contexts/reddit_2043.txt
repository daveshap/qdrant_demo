Cringe with me.
So basically, I'm gobbling down some fries at lunch and scrolling through reddit on my phone. . . Suddenly, a notification pops onto my screen. "You've been admitted into \[INSERT STATE COLLEGE\]." YESSSSS.

So I save this energy for home, and the moment I walk through the front door I find myself in the bathroom jumping up and down, slapping my own ass like a madman. I don't know why I am like this but I am basically slapping both cheeks with my hands and screaming with joy in front of the mirror.  Then, after having done this for maybe a full 2 minutes, I hear the creak of a door.

And this is the part where I actually want to die. My stomach drops and I realize that my Mom has been home the entire time and almost definitely heard everything.

I haven't left my room since.

EDIT: Zoo wee MAMA! Thank you for the Silver!
