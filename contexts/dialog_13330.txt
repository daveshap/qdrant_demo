LILA: How's work?
NATHAN: Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
LILA: No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
NATHAN: My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
LILA: Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
NATHAN: I guess.
LILA: Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
NATHAN: Have you?
LILA: Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
NATHAN: Really?
LILA: Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
NATHAN: How come?
LILA: Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
NATHAN: Such as what womanly things?
LILA: Such as my man and how to please him! Such as making wonderful dinners for my man! Such as looking pretty for my man! And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
LILA: I had sold my fucking soul.
NATHAN: I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable. At the time though I thought it might help.
