NYAH: When they've got your recruiting technique? Not a thing.
ETHAN: Oh. Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
NYAH: They've got a book for this?
ETHAN: They've got a book for everything.
NYAH: The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth. He'd lie about his favorite color. But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard. All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
ETHAN: Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
NYAH: That's not the point. In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
ETHAN: Which is?
NYAH: That they're lying.
ETHAN: So where did I got right?
NYAH: You're not a liar. Or you're an awfully good one.. ..this thing these blokes pinched..
ETHAN: I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
NYAH: Well, then, what I am I doing here? I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
ETHAN: So do I. Sort of.
NYAH: Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
ETHAN: Of what?
NYAH: Ask a question, you get an answer!..
ETHAN: Damn, you're beautiful.
NYAH: That's because I'm on my back.
