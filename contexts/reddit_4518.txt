To whoever needs to hear this: It will get better!
About a year ago, I was feeling  very down. I've struggled with depression for most of my adult life. I posted a depressive post here and got a few replies from people trying to cheer me up which didnt do much. However, things did eventually start getting better. Some by chance others by decision. If you are feeling low. Trust the process and life cycles of ups and downs. It's not always your fault but you do have a choice in your future. As humans we are fine tuned machines but things can get out of line in our brains or our surroundings causing depression. Its important to keep going forward even if its just baby steps or taking breaks when necessary. Learn to practice self love.
