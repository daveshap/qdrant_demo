CRAIG: You were him last night, weren't you?
LOTTE: Yes.
CRAIG: And he was with her.
LOTTE: We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
CRAIG: We?
LOTTE: Me and John.
CRAIG: Don't forget me.
LOTTE: Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
LOTTE: I'm sorry. That was nasty.
CRAIG: Life is confusing, isn't it?
LOTTE: Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions. I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
CRAIG: I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated. No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
MAXINE: You're late.
CRAIG: Are you torturing me on purpose?
MAXINE: I've fallen in love.
CRAIG: I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
MAXINE: You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
CRAIG: You're evil, Maxine.
MAXINE: Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
LESTER: Yes, my dear?
FLORIS: Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
LESTER: Thank you, Floris.
FLORIS: Think, Jew florist?
LESTER: Good morning, Lotte!
