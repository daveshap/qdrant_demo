Do people in elite fields (investment banking, management consulting, big law etc) tend to be more cold-hearted compared to others ?
I've always noticed this elitist feel about them. Like to them they only care about results and anything else that gets in the way of results (apart from blatant illegal stuff) is a bother to them. 

People in this field usually attract a lot of Type A aggressive people that can make really hard decisions such as giving advice to close down a factory and laying off the employees etc.
