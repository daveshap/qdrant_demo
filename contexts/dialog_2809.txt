OSBORNE: You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
HARDY: You're right. We should sit in silence.
OSBORNE: We're in the middle of a murder case --
HARDY: Best time for banal chit-chat.
OSBORNE: What is that?
HARDY: Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
OSBORNE: Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
HARDY: You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
OSBORNE: Something like that. You?
HARDY: I lost a bet.
OSBORNE: You're kidding.
HARDY: Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
