i just want to know how to leave without making my mom sad.
how is it, that i’m so young with so much life ahead of me, yet i feel so fucking trapped. i feel like i’m under water so deep and when my fingertips finally touch the surface i’m pulled back down. i don’t see myself graduating, i don’t see myself getting married, i don’t see myself giving birth, i don’t see myself in the future. i just want to know how to leave without making my mom sad.


edit: i am still here. my life has took a turn and has changed me. i look at life so much more positive now. if your scrolling deep down into this subreddit right now please read. if you are struggling, or relate to the past me^ please, know that no matter what anyone tells you, you are ENOUGH to stay on this earth. no matter what you go through, or how sad or depressed or suicidal you are right now, give yourself a break for a day, realize that you are only human and that you don’t have to meet ANYONES expectations. go at your own pace, you’re here for a long life, take it slow. things WILL (eventually) get better. go talk to your dogs, your cats, your fish, your mom/dad/sister/brother/grandma/grandpa/cousin/aunt/uncle, ANYONE who brings you a good laugh, and if you don’t have many of those people talk to me.  in conclusion, YOUR MOM WILL BE SAD. so please take into consideration that you’re worth every breathable second in this world. <3
