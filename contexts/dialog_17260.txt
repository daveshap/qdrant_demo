HAWKEYE: I don't feel anything.
TRAPPER: Oh, Jesus.
TRAPPER: I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
HAWKEYE: I don't get it.
TRAPPER: It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
HAWKEYE: What do we do?
TRAPPER: We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
HAWKEYE: Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
TRAPPER: Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.
RADAR: A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
HAWKEYE: I though you said we didn't have a drop.
RADAR: I found a doner.
TRAPPER: How is he?
UGLY JOHN: Nice.
TRAPPER: Arterial silk.
TRAPPER: Ease off on those tapes, and let's see how much it bleeds. How is he?
UGLY JOHN: Nice.
TRAPPER: Boys, we're home free.
HAWKEYE: When will he be able to write?
DUKE: What's he got to write, for God's sake?
HAWKEYE: An application to Androscoggin College.
