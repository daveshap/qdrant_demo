JANE: Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him. Not near ready. Not by the longest shot. Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story. I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
PAUL: Okay, that's your opinion. I don't agree.
JANE: It's not opinion.
PAUL: You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
PAUL: It must be nice to always believe you know better. To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
JANE: No, it's awful. Oh my, it's awful.
