Need Advice on a Participation Grade
So, I'm in an online Masters program where a lot of the course is based around forum discussions with classmates, projects, and quizzes. In the last week of the course, we have a final assignment of providing the top 5 names of classmates that we believe contributed to our learning in the class.

For every classmate that puts your name down, you can receive 7pts. There is no cap on how many points you can receive, however, the syllabus allotted 40points (or 4%) of your total grade to this portion of the class. So, if you get all 40pts you get an A on this and any additional points you receive is just extra credit. Yes, I know that 7 doesnt go into 40 equally, no idea how they came up with this...

For me, I was only put down by one person, so I received 7 pts (lost 33pts) bringing my grade down from a 92% to an 88.7%.

My biggest question here is, in a grad school program or ANY program, how can 4% of my grade be subjectively judged by my peers to have this much of an impact overall in my course? I tried messaging my professor about this and they didnt view this as subjective so now I'm really stumped and just overall dont feel that this was appropriate. She stated that this was always on the syllabus and having meaningful and impactful discussions with peers is essential for grad school. I dont disagree but I received perfect scores on all of my discussion posts...

In every other category of the course I received nothing lower than an A- but in the end I was brought down by subjective judgment from my peers because no one wrote my name down as having an impact on their learning...

Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated.  Is this normal?  Is this even an acceptable way of measuring my time in the class?  Overall, it just feels so gross..
