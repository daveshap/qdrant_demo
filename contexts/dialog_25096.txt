HARRY: Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
STOSH: Let me alone.
HARRY: You're crying, Animal.
STOSH: It's that song, Harry!
HARRY: You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
STOSH: There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
