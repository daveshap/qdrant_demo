What to do when the same vacancy is advertised both by the company directly and by external recruiters?
My initial thought was that the companies will prefer to hire directly, as that will cost them less. I've also had a couple bad experience with recruiters who seemed a bit incompetent about the field they were hiring in.

But maybe recruiters have direct channels that will help me get noticed?
