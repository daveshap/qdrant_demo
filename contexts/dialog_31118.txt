HUNTER: Why?
GLORIA: I think she's acting. I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her. I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
RAY: Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
HUNTER: The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
GLORIA: That doesn't make him a child rapist. There's something else. This girl's had some problems. Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars. Ran away...
HUNTER: Where's this coming from?
GLORIA: I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years. We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
RAY: That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide. You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
GLORIA: All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
HUNTER: I want a full-scale investigation.
GLORIA: You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
HUNTER: I don't care. You heard that girl's statement. I think he's dirty. Get me a case.
