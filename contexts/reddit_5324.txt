How to stop assuming everything needs to be done ASAP? [Discipline]
Hi,

Everytime my bosses say they need me to do something, I immediately jump and work at 110% because I don't know when they need it by and usually since I'm so young, I might have to learn how to do it in the first place. I guess I'm more accustomed to the school kind of deadlines where if I am late, there is no opportunity to make it up where as in the real world, I am witnessing first had other people having deadlines to send to us but are repeatedly late and delayed. Any tips on not having 24/7 anxiety because I am in a constant battle against the clock in my mind? Almost like a "it'll be done whenever it gets done"sort of mentality? Now I'm not talking slacking, just a little more relaxation. My one boss even has said that i dont need to jump at everything he says because he just randomly talks and says a lot. The few times I asked when they needed it by, they of course said ASAP but then several days went by without touching it. Thank you all very much.
