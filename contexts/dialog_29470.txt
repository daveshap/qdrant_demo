TOMMY: How's it going with Gail?
SPUD: No joy yet.
TOMMY: How long is it?
SPUD: Six weeks.
TOMMY: Six weeks!
SPUD: It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
TOMMY: Where did she come up with that?
SPUD: She read it in Cosmopolitan.
TOMMY: Six weeks and no sex?
SPUD: I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
GAIL: I read it in Cosmopolitan.
LIZZY: It's an interesting theory.
GAIL: Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
LIZZY: What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
GAIL: What happened?
LIZZY: He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
TOMMY: Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
SPUD: That's fair enough.
TOMMY: Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
SPUD: Went ballistic?
TOMMY: Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
SPUD: So what's it going to be?
TOMMY: Well, I've paid for the ticket.
