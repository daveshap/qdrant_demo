ROY: Well, thank you. And thank them.
SIMMS: Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
ROY: That's true, Mr. Simms.
SIMMS: We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
ROY: Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
SIMMS: Happy to see you looking so good.
