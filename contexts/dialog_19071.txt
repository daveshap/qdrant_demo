NAPOLEON: I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais. I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
JOSEPHINE: Yes, I'm afraid he is. I believe he is riding. I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
NAPOLEON: Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
