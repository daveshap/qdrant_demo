ORDELL: Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
LOUIS: If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
ORDELL: 'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
LOUIS: Maybe the Feds got it.
ORDELL: If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
LOUIS: That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
ORDELL: Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
LOUIS: I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
ORDELL: Or... ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
LOUIS: Jesus Christ.
ORDELL: What?
LOUIS: You know who I saw in the dress department?
ORDELL: Tell me.
LOUIS: I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
ORDELL: You gonna tell me who it was?
LOUIS: Max Cherry.
ORDELL: You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
LOUIS: Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
ORDELL: Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
LOUIS: How am I supposed to know that?
ORDELL: You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
LOUIS: Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
ORDELL: Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!
LOUIS: I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
ORDELL: Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
