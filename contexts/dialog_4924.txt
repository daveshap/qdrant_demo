AARON: What did they do with you?
TOM: They booted me out of Washington.
AARON: Impossible. There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
TOM: Why? What did they do to you?
ERNIE: It's what he did. I'm proud of him.
AARON: They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
ERNIE: The cost-efficient reporter.
AARON: So I quit.
TOM: You packing up tonight?
AARON: Yes. And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
TOM: London.
AARON: London. That's a promotion!
TOM: I don't think so.
AARON: It is. Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor. I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
TOM: Hold it down, okay?
AARON: Can I ask you something? You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
TOM: Yes. You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
AARON: No. I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
AARON: This story they won't cover. And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
TOM: I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
TOM: You know what I...
AARON: No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay. Be good. So long.
