MILES: Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
JACK: You know her?
MILES: Sure I know Maya.
JACK: You know that chick?
MILES: Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
JACK: She is very hot.
MILES: And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
JACK: Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
MILES: This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
JACK: So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
MILES: You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay? The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
MAYA: Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
MILES: Maya, how are you?
MAYA: I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
MILES: Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
MAYA: Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
MILES: You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
JACK: Hiya.
MAYA: Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
JACK: Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
MILES: Well, she does know a lot about wine.
JACK: Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
MILES: And she likes Pinot.
JACK: Perfect.
MILES: Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
JACK: Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
MILES: She works for tips!
JACK: You're blind, dude. Blind.
