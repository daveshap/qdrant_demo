NICKY: That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
VALERIE: That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
NICKY: You think I'm a tourist?
VALERIE: I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
NICKY: The South.
VALERIE: Really?
NICKY: Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why.
VALERIE: Why are you laughing?
NICKY: I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
VALERIE: My dad's an optometrist.
NICKY: My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
VALERIE: I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
NICKY: If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
VALERIE: Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
NICKY: Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
VALERIE: That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
NICKY: Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
VALERIE: If you want to.
NICKY: Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
VALERIE: Octopus people?""
NICKY: Uh, it's a deep south expression.
NICKY: It's freezing my hands.
VALERIE: It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
