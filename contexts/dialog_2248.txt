THERAPIST: So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
SCOTT EVIL: Well, it's kind of weird.
THERAPIST: We don't judge here.
SCOTT EVIL: OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
THERAPIST: And how do you feel about that?
SCOTT EVIL: I don't wanna take over the family business.
DR. EVIL: But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
SCOTT EVIL: Not me.
THERAPIST: What do you want to do, Scott?
SCOTT EVIL: I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
DR. EVIL: An evil vet?
SCOTT EVIL: No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
DR. EVIL: An evil petting zoo?
SCOTT EVIL: You always do that! Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
THERAPIST: We don't label people here, Scott.
SCOTT EVIL: No, he's really evil.
THERAPIST: Scott.
DR. EVIL: No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
THERAPIST: Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
SCOTT EVIL: I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
THERAPIST: OK, Scott, no one really wants to kill" anyone here. They say it
DR. EVIL: Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
THERAPIST: We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
DR. EVIL: The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
THERAPIST: That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
