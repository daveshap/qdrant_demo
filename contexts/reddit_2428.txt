COVID19: Can my boss refuse to fire me and just not pay me if I demand to work from home, forcing me to quit?
I am the Sales & Marketing Director for a privately owned assisted living community in Connecticut. It was hard enough to convince people to join our community after the virus hit when we weren’t allowing any more in person tours, family visits, and were COVID-19 free...

But then one of our residents tested positive for the virus after visiting another facility for outpatient services. Several of my community’s workers - CNAs, private duty aides, and food service workers all interacted with the patient in the time after she returned but before she was confirmed to have Covid19.  Most, but not all, were wearing facemasks, gloves, and eye protection during their interactions, but no one was wearing protective gowns or protective footwear. A couple hours ago one of the exposed food service workers was sent home with a 102 degree fever...

I have a wife and several children, all younger than 10 years old. I came into the office today for what I thought was the last time and told my boss that I no longer could come to the community and would instead work from home. I also let him know that if this was not okay, then it would be best to let me go so I could file for unemployment and look for a new job.

About an hour later I hear from the owner of the community who tells me that if I don’t come in and work out of the office, he will no longer pay me and I can quit if I don’t like it. He said he won’t fire me, he just won’t pay me - preventing me from applying for unemployment benefits. When I told him that this was against the law, his reply was, “Sue me, then.”

What the hell can I do?  Can I quit and still collect unemployment?
