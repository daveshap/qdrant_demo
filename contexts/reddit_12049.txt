I'm not sure what to do with my life anymore
I'm stuck at work and feel like I cant handle my life. I'm a 22 year old biology grad that is unsure what to do with my life. I have been fighting with my parents due to indecisiveness of career. Things with my parents have deteriorated to the point were I actively avoid them or a fight is guaranteed to happen. About 4 days ago I decided to finally pursue law school and felt pretty good about it, in fact much better than I had in a long time, things seemed like they could be on the upswing. However, the next day my girlfriend if 5 years broke up with me, this was a girl that i defended from my family and friends, she wasn't just my SO but she was my best friend and one that I would have married in a heartbeat. Its hard, I feel lost and unsure and I find myself on the brink of losing it while trying to keep it all in. I cant talk to my family about it and my friends seem to preoccupied. Idk I just feel empty and lost. I miss her and don't know what to do other than throw myself at work to distract myself, this is my fourth 13 hour day in a row. What should I do?
