Hong Kong transit visa processing time I am an Indian citizen and want to go into Hong Kong during my 15-hour layover. I applied with the pre-arrival registration form and was denied. I have sent the visa documents via fax and also separately by airmail to the Hong Kong Immigration department. At this point, I have 5 weeks before the time of my travel. Will I be able to get a transit visa within that time and, if not, is there any other way to get it quickly?
