NICKY: This could be it.
PETER: I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
JACK: This could be it.
PETER: This could be it.
JACK: Let's work on it.
PETER: Let's work on it.
PAISLEY: Do you think he can do it?
NICKY: I don't know.
PAISLEY: He's a very sweet man.
NICKY: Where are you going now?
PAISLEY: Home.
NICKY: Someone waiting for you?
PAISLEY: No one's waiting.
NICKY: There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
PAISLEY: If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
NICKY: So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
PAISLEY: But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
NICKY: I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
PAISLEY: Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
NICKY: Yes.
PAISLEY: Never mind.
NICKY: What? Come on, Paisley.
PAISLEY: Our Steven not only disguises himself.
NICKY: Yes.
PAISLEY: He goes to the theater armed.
JACK: This could Pbe it.
PETER: This could be it.
PAISLEY: He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
NICKY: I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
