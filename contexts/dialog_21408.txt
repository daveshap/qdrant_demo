KROSS: What would it take to buy our stock back? Name your price.
EDWARD: To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid. But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.

EDWARD: You're not getting any navy contracts.
DAVID: There's no way you could know that.
EDWARD: But I do know. I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will... Ah, the escargot.
