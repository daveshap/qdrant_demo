Oxymoron structure - best way to structure Writing a short story in which a young person finds a new friendship in an older person. And invites the older person to an event with a lot of young, long term friends.I'm blanking out on what is better to describe the older person to a group of long term friends. \"Hello everyone, I want you to meet...\"\"... my old, new friend {name}.\"or\"... my new, old friend {name}.\"Yes, I'm aware both are 'rude', the context here is the all the friends are significantly younger, and the protagonist is putting it out there to remove the awkwardness others may have toward the newcomer.
