GILL: What happened?
RONNIE: They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had. I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but... But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for.... It's a long process but... they sent me home.
GILL: I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
RONNIE: I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
GILL: She's around. Always is.
RONNIE: I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
GILL: You been home yet?
RONNIE: Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
GILL: You need a ride?
