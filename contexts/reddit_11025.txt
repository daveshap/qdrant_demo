To the teenager who came into my shop today with your mom
Your mom came in today asking for my help to invade your private life. She even brought you with her. I can’t imagine how embarrassing that must be. 

She asked me to go through your phone and computer and find any apps or photos that she wouldn’t approve of, because she was too technology illiterate to do it herself, all the while making you watch. (I work at a tech support shop) 

Personally I think this is an invasion of your personal space and privacy. 

So when I found the folder where you’d hid all your movies and games, I made sure to pretend I didn’t see them. 

On your phone, I told her that you didn’t have anything but the default apps and angry birds. 

And then, I showed her a place where she could look on your phone that would only show her the default apps, not the ones you downloaded. So hopefully when she invaded your space again, she won’t find anything. 

Was I wrong to do what I did? Probably. But you’re only a year or two away from adulthood and I don’t think it’s right that anyone be that intrusive, mother or not. 

Good luck in life man. Hope things get better for you soon. 


Edit: Thanks for the shiny medals! I’ll be sure to take good care of them. 

Also, way too many comments to keep up with, but I’ll try to read them all and respond :)

Edit 2: For those of you saying that I ripped the mom off, I didn’t take her money. It only took me 10 minutes to go through, and I had nothing better to do at the time.
