BURGUNDY: So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English? You look pretty ordinary to me...
JEANNE: Am I... am I dead?
BURGUNDY: Dead you're worthless, darling.
JEANNE: Where... where am I?
BURGUNDY: Guess.
JEANNE: My king will pay any ransom you ask.
BURGUNDY: Your king? Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows? Chickens? I prefer gold, and the English have plenty. I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
JEANNE: God defeated the English, not me.
BURGUNDY: And God who allowed you to be caught?
