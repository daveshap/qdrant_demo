How can I securely disable CSRF validation for native clients when browser clients access the same API? I have an API endpoint that is accessible by both native (console, mobile apps) and Javascript based clients.How do I ensure that the CSRF AntiForgeryToken is only invoked during Javascript calls?Can this be done in a non-authenticated/anonymous manner? Or are the entitlements listed within an authentication token the only way for a server to determine if CSRF should be applied? (native vs browser flow)Do Javascript clients (not the libraries themselves) have a specific set of HTTP headers and corresponding values that I can rely upon to determine the request type?Does separating the API services (APIController) onto a separate web server, with a different DNS name, allow me to use Same Origin Policy (SOP), to effectively force the Javascript clients to apply the headers that would otherwise be omitted in scenario 3 above?
