JIM: You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald?
MERCER: That's right. When I saw him on TV, I was shocked. I said to my family, that was the man I saw in the truck.""
JIM: But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
MERCER: That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered. My statements...
MERCER: This says Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck." That's not true. I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck
JIM: Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
MERCER: I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
