MILLER: SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein. Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain. Motions impatiently to Sarge.
MILLER: More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
SARGE: Hesitates. Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack. Finds the morphine.
MILLER: Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot. He's done this before.
REIBEN: On guard, glancing back. Pissed off.
REIBEN: Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
UPHAM: Freaked out. Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter. Can't.
JACKSON: Watching.
MILLER: Gives Wade the second shot.
