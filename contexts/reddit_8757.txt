What are the pros and cons of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos's approach to education reform?
I’ve been hearing a lot about Trump’s pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, some of it bad and some of it good. [It seems pretty clear that]( http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/interview_with_betsy_devos) she strongly supports “school choice” – in other words, she is a supporter of scholarship tax credits, vouchers, education savings accounts, and charter schools.
I’ve seen hefty criticism of her approach to public education, and I’ve also seen some praise, as well as some sources that [give a pretty even rundown of both sides of the debate]( http://www.balancedpolitics.org/school_vouchers.htm). [According to what I’ve been able to find] ( http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/interview_with_betsy_devos), the pros of her approach are:

- It will encourage more innovation in schools, helping to move our stagnated public education system forward by creating competition.

- It will give poor families the same opportunity to choose their kids’ education as rich families have.

- Those who attend private schools generally have [higher SAT scores]( http://www.capenet.org/pdf/Outlook399.pdf) than those who attend public schools. However, [others]( http://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/comparing-private-public-school-test-scores/) say that once you apply a standardized test such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and adjust it for socioeconomic factors, there is little to no difference between the scores of public and private schools.

- Private schools allow students to attain a greater depth in subjects that interest them.

- Private schools are more effective than public schools at managing their money.

The cons, on the other hand, are:

- Vouchers drain funds from public schools.

- Private schools aren’t monitored as closely as public schools; therefore, there is a risk that some may not provide a fair, balanced, or responsible education.

- Whereas public schools are open to everyone, private schools can discriminate based on a variety of factors. However, I would personally argue that public schools also discriminate in a way, based on income – because public school funding is tied to property values, [lower-income families tend to be stuck with lower-quality schools]( http://www.npr.org/2016/04/18/474256366/why-americas-schools-have-a-money-problem).

- Some, such as the [NY Times]( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/opinion/betsy-devos-and-the-wrong-way-to-fix-schools.html), cite her track record as an example of what will happen if she implements her policies as Secretary of Education. However, the Times also acknowledges that this doesn’t automatically discount the potential of charter schools, citing their success in New Orleans, where rigorous oversight from local leaders ensures that the schools don’t discriminate.

So I’m curious to know your guys’ take on this. What are the pros and cons of her approach to education, and do you think it would ultimately help or hurt the country?
