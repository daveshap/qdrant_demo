Does anyone else hate when they start talking about something they’re passionate about, but then start to feel like they’re being annoying and then stop talking about it?
To explain, 

I used to live in a decent sized city, and I found backroads in the country that takes me on a nice drive away from all of the light pollution and it’s nice to just be away from people and enjoy the country. Anytime I was feeling down or negative I would just hop in my car and go. The drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful, by the time I got home I was usually in a much better headspace. I just really loved that drive. 

When explaining the drive to a girl I was really into at the time, she was talking about how it’s impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many. I have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn, I proceeded to go over every turn. about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything. 

“does she actually give a shit about this?”

“you look stupid just stop”

the usual. 

I then stopped halfway through everything, gave like a half smile and said that I had forgot. 

This is just something that always goes through my head, there are probably better explanations on this but this is the first one that came to mind. Thanks for letting me vent guys.
