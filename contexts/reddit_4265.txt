Advice for everyone
Been reading a lot of these posts lately and something I've noticed is that everyone is making things more complicated than it actually is. Dating is very simple when you look at it the right way. Don't over read actions and words because everyone is different in what those words and actions mean. What you need to observe is the over all feeling of someone. If you get a "hint" that someone doesn't like you back, they don't. If someone is "acting" clingy, they are. Simple as that. Save for a few specific senarios most people are extremely straightforward about what they want and don't beat around the bush.
