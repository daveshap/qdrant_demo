Do thermal cutoffs exist that would work with a line that is 40-75V 0.5A and a max temp of ~85\u00b0C? I have a bunch of COB LEDs that I am going to wire in series using an LED driver. The driver gives off between 40-75V and 0.5A max. The circuit should run around 70V and 0.5A.Due to space requirements, I need to locate the driver away from the light casing. Thus, the 70V 0.5A line is the only thing that will be running into the case to the LEDs. I would like to put a thermal cutoff (triggered at around ~85\u00b0C) in the case, but it seems most cutoffs are either AC or DC (but rated for much lower voltage).I've searched Digikey and Mouser but can't find any cutoff that would work. I'm guessing there must be some solution but I don't know enough about various electronics.
