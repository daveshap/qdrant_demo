DRUMLIN: I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
ELLIE: I'm willing to take that risk.
DRUMLIN: I'm not. You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
ELLIE: Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity. There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
DRUMLIN: And only two probabilities: One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
ELLIE: You're --
DRUMLIN: Two: There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
ELLIE: What if you're wrong? No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
DRUMLIN: I disagree.
ELLIE: Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
