TROY: But first, you have to start with the clothes!
EVE: Exactly. You understand that, don't you? You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
ADAM: All right.
EVE: So, what are you seeing?
TROY: I don't know.
EVE: Money is no object. He's got cards up the wazoo.
ADAM: The what?
EVE: Wazoo! Try to listen. Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
TROY: You're serious, aren't you?
EVE: What's that supposed to mean?
TROY: It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
EVE: Well, that's blunt!
TROY: I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
EVE: And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing, don't you?
TROY: I see elegant.""
EVE: Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
TROY: That's what I'm sensing.
ADAM: The guy with the underpants!
EVE: That's boring!
TROY: Not on him.
ADAM: I'm not wearing his pants.
TROY: Why not? He has great pants.
ADAM: I just don't want to.
TROY: Okay.
TROY: Alright, I will.
EVE: I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
TROY: What do you think, Adam?
ADAM: About clothing?
EVE: Yeah.
ADAM: Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
TROY: Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
ADAM: No.
EVE: What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
ADAM: It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
ADAM: I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
TROY: Almost all of them.
ADAM: The recovery is very impressive.
TROY: The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
ADAM: Amazing. I'm very impressed.
TROY: Well, what do you think?
EVE: I think...it...works.
TROY: Let me show you the entire trousseau!
