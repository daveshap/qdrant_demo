PROXIMO: You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...? and you act like one. What was your crime?
NARCISSUS: I killed too many barbarians.
PROXIMO: I'm a Greek, thank you. And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians. Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white. Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
NARCISSUS: Who the hell are you?
PROXIMO: I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate. I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me. I own this school and everything that's in it. You're in it! But why? What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets. Please, I separated you from the others because... ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
NARCISSUS: Condemned? Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
PROXIMO: General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
NARCISSUS: Impossible! Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome!
