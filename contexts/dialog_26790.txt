WERNER: Dr. Furtwängler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
STEVE: Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
WERNER: It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
STEVE: He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
WERNER: Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
STEVE: Brave? To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
WERNER: It was Beethoven's Ninth.
STEVE: Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
