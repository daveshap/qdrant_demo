160 Year Solar Orbital Period & 1.9 Year Moon Orbital Period - Is it possible? A defining factor of my world is the hardships inhabitants have to face when surviving long seasons. Due to the extreme length of a year, time is largely measured by moon cycles. I need to make sure though that the solar/luna cycles are a) Generally possible, and b) able to sustain life.Here is the general premise of my solar/luna cycle:The Planet's sun is many times larger than the Earth's sun (no exact size determined yet)The Planet takes 120* Earth-Years to orbitThe Planet is ~1.5x the size of the Earth, and ~1.5x the mass.The Planet has an axial tilt, giving it Summers &amp; Winters (and Spring &amp; Autumn)The Moon takes 1.9 Earth-Years to orbit the PlanetThe Moon is visible in the Planet's sky, similar in size to Earth's Moon (or even appearing slightly bigger)So my questions are:Is it possible to have a habitable planet that takes 160 Earth-Years to orbit the sun if the sun is sufficiently large enough, and the planet's orbital distance is sufficiently far away?Is it possible to have a moon that takes 1.9 Earth-Years to orbit a planet, and if so: how big would the moon have to be for it to be visible in the sky (as described above) when considering the (yet-uncalculated) distance its orbit would have to be for it to take 1.9 Earth-Years?Any help would be greatly appreciated, even if it's pointing me in the direction of tools and resources that could help me calculate this by myself.EDIT: I made a mistake in my original post. The length of the planet's orbit is 120 Earth-Years, not 160.I've also changed it so that the moon's cycle is now only ~48.8 Earth Days. I imagine this is a lot more realistic. Thanks for all your replies so far!
