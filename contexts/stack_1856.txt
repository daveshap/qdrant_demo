Rephrasing \"a field is becoming ripe for\" or \"maturing\" with a more appropriate sentence I am writing a scientific article in collaboration with a colleague. We wrote <blockquote>  \"studies of this field are becoming ripe for further exploration...\". </blockquote>Something about the word \"ripe\" in this sentence is not nice but I can not seem to get successful at rephrasing it in a better way. Some of the sentences I tried:<blockquote>  Research in this field is maturing.    Findings in this field are becoming amenable to deeper investigations.</blockquote>They are still awful. Any suggestions/hints to write this better by the masters of the art in this great forum will be really appreciated.
