NICKY: Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
ACE: What people?
NICKY: What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
ACE: I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
NICKY: No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
ACE: I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody... I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
NICKY: You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
ACE: Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
NICKY: Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
ACE: I -
NICKY: I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
ACE: What are you -
NICKY: You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?! They think you went batshit!
ACE: I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
NICKY: Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television! You wanted to go on TV.
ACE: Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
NICKY: You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
ACE: Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
NICKY: Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
ACE: No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
NICKY: Back -
ACE: ...you? Do you remember what I told you?
NICKY: Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
ACE: You never - ?
NICKY: Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me! That's the only reason! Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?! You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
