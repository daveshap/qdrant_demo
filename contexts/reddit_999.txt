anyone else find they need near constant background noise to help stop anxious/depressed inner thoughts?
I realised I always have background noise, audiobooks, music, netflix, something on. I especially need this in times of quiet or before bed when my anxious and obsessive thoughts start to eat away at me. I can't seem to be alone with my inner thoughts, I'm not sure if it's healthy or not but the white noise seems to stem the flow and ease my mind
