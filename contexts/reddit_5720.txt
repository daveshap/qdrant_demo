Currently unemployed with several gaps in my resume. 25 years old, no degree, any advice?
I've been unemployed for one year, and whenever I try to edit my resume so I can apply to jobs, I panic and then I freeze due to some of the gaps in my resume, which are long (1 year in general). I don't like making excuses for myself, and that's exactly what it feels like when I try to explain the gaps in my resume. I've been paid to train kids in sports (soccer) and I've worked with my dad before, but otherwise I haven't developed any particular skills in the time that I've been unemployed. Before that, I've been able to hold down jobs for 7-9 months, and I usually only quit due to external circumstances (i.e. commute) which I know isn't ideal by any means, but it's... something.

I don't even what kind of questions to ask, and if it's okay with whoever replies to my thread, then I'd appreciate if we're able to talk in private since I think it'll be easier for me to speak openly about this in private. Right now, I feel somewhere between tense and ashamed. But if that isn't feasible, then I'll try my best to discuss it directly on here.

Disclaimer: I would've posted this on the subreddit dedicated to reviewing resumes, but I don't feel comfortable posting my resume, and I think the assistance I require goes beyond that, but if my thread is off topic, then please let me know, and I can move it elsewhere.
