JANET: Oh, Brad. Let's go back. I'm cold and I'm frightened.
BRAD: Just a moment, Janet. They may have a telephone.
RIFF RAFF: Hello.
BRAD: Uh - oh - Hi! My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. I - ah - wondered if you could help us. Our car has broken down about two miles up the road. Do you have a phone we might use?
RIFF RAFF: You're wet.
JANET: Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
BRAD: Yes.
