Have you ever felt anxious because everything in your life is going on perfectly, but you are worried about something wrong that might be happening without you realize it?
It's a period in my life when everything is fine. I didn't quarrel with my boyfriend in years, I am passing all my exams, my parents are strangely nice and comprehensive with me, I didn't even catch a cold and I am surrounded by lovely people... I am used to living an unpleasant life, bearing problems all the day and feeling nervous at night and deeply unhappy. However, now I COULD live the perfect life, but I keep asking myself why is everything fine, what's going to happen, if I have any disease, what terrifying destiny is going to punch me in the face. Because of this, my hypochondria is getting worse, I sometimes am convinced that it's not possible for me not to have problems in life, so I must have some deadly disease and every signal my body give to me makes me want to run to the doctor... Sometimes I can't sleep at night because I fear that my house will burn while I sleep, or that some thief will break into my home to steal something (even though we don't own anything valuable!) and doing bad to my family... Have you ever felt that way or am I just an idiot to feel even more anxious because I literally have NOTHING to worry about?
