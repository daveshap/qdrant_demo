Does anyone that has dealt with depression /anxiety pre Covid19 feel even more out-of-sync with their peers even tho “everyone” is struggling with mental health, sadness and anxiety?
I’m just trying to figure out if it’s just me. Some days I feel supercharged and extra supportive of my friends who are struggling and don’t respond to texts, video calls, online game sessions, invitations to virtually hang out, not being invited to virtual gatherings between friends, etc. I’m like “I get it, that’s ok, I understand because I know what depression is like...”

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel “god I must be so terrible, that’s why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others” 

Then I reach out or try to communicate my situation gently, (even asking honestly AITA). the response is more like “Hmm tbh I haven’t really been putting effort into doing things or seeing people. Not that I don’t ask to do things but... I just am not expecting to do anything maybe? Or expecting people to do things with me? And so, if people reach out to me, that’s cool. But if they don’t, I’m not reading into it.”

All of that sounds extremely healthy and understandable, so I repeat the cycle again. I can’t seem to feel normal in this world. It’s like dancing off beat all the time. I feel like most of my life I have been unselfishly receptive to what others are struggling with (since I’ve been there so long).

I just don’t know how to relate I guess.
