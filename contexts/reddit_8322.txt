The US Supreme Court heard oral arguments today in the Masterpiece Cakeshop vs. Colorado Civil Rights Commission case. What are the legal arguments for each side?
For those unfamiliar with the case, basically a gay couple (Charlie Craig and David Mullins) came to Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado and asked the owner, Jack Phillips, to make a cake for them for their wedding. Phillips told them that although they're welcome to purchase a pre-made cake or other varieties of dessert, he will not create a cake specifically for same-sex weddings.

Craig and Mullins filed a lawsuit against Phillips for discrimination under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act ("[CADA](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2016/title-24/principal-departments/article-34/part-6/section-24-34-601)"), which they won in district court. The Colorado Appellate court upheld the ruling saying that Phillips must provide custom cakes for **any** wedding, so long as he offers custom wedding cakes as a service (he has actually stopped making wedding cakes at all since this ruling, a move which he reports cost him 40% of his business and forced him to lay off half of his staff [(Source)](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/05/politics/supreme-court-masterpiece-cakeshop/index.html). 

Now, Phillips is arguing that CADA violates the [First Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) by compelling him to create something in conflict with his religious beliefs. 

This will surely be an important First Amendment case for the Court. What are the legal arguments in support of both sides?
