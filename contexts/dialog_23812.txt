VICTORIA: Hello?
MILES: Victoria.
VICTORIA: Miles?
MILES: Victoria! How the hell are you?
VICTORIA: Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
MILES: Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
VICTORIA: Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
MILES: Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
VICTORIA: Where are you?
MILES: A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
MILES: Hello?
VICTORIA: Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
MILES: I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
VICTORIA: Ken.
MILES: Ken.
VICTORIA: Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
MILES: Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
VICTORIA: I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
MILES: You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
MILES: I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
VICTORIA: Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
