I was about to start crying but grabbed a pen and paper and wrote this instead. I didn’t cry. I’m going to buy a notebook.
It’s not me.
I know it looks like me but it’s not me.
I swear.
I won’t name it or give it a pronoun because it doesn’t deserve one.
Just remember that I’m still in here.
I swear.
