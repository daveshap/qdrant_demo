Why does the length of a pendulum cause different natural frequencies of pendulums in Barton's pendulum? In Barton's pendulum, the pendulum with string that is the same length, L, as the brass bob (source of driving frequency) has natural frequency equals to the bob's driving frequency. The pendulum with string longer than the brass bob i.e. L+x has a natural frequency that is smaller in value than the pendulum with string of length L (correct me if i'm wrong, but I deduced this since a pendulum with length L+x has a phase difference of 180 degree in displacement with the driving brass bob's displacement).Alternatively, the pendulum with string shorter than the brass bob i.e. L-x has a natural frequency that is larger in value than the pendulum with string of length L.My question is, why does the length of a pendulum cause different natural frequencies of the pendulums? Why would a longer pendulum have a smaller natural frequency than a shorter pendulum? Interestingly, the pendulum with the same length as the brass bob will coincidently have its natural frequency as the bob's driving frequency, could this be explained?
