How do I make the hardware power-off button show a menu/zenity message on fluxbox or other alternative window managers (16.04)? When I press the hardware power button and the login screen (or unity) is running I get a nice \"are you sure you want to shutdown\" message.When I am running fluxbox, I get a software shutdown, but no message/confirmation.Is there any way to change that? I don't mind writing the zenity script/program, I just need a place to put it.
