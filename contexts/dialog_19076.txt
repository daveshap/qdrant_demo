NAPOLEON: You could hear them?
JUNOT: Yes.
NAPOLEON: You mean you heard them making love?
JUNOT: Yes.
NAPOLEON: How did you know it was Captain Charles?
JUNOT: I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
NAPOLEON: Can you give me a drink, please?
JUNOT: Yes, of course. What do you want?
JUNOT: I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
NAPOLEON: And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
JUNOT: I believe so. I believe Madame Bonaparte was not discreet, in Paris.
BOURRIENNE: General Bonaparte?
NAPOLEON: Come back in an hour.
BOURRIENNE: Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
NAPOLEON: Come in.
BOURRIENNE: This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
NAPOLEON: Let me see it.
