I got baited
I'm waiting for my USC decision in the mail, and about an hour ago I look out the window and there's both a UPS truck and the mail truck in front of my house. I see the UPS man walk from his truck to my house, and I instantly get hyped because that means I got a fucking parcel! Everyone knows that a big package is an acceptance. 

Turns out that it was just something my Dad ordered online. 

And then I got a rejection from USC from the mail. Who wants to be a Trojan anyways
