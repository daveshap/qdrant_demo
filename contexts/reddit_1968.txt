Colleges👏need👏to👏know👏that👏loans👏aren’t👏financial👏aid
Seriously, they need to stop including loans in your financial aid award values. I got an email saying that I was awarded enough aid to cover the costs of one of my colleges, only to look at the report and see that $27,000 of it was from Unsubsidized/Parent PLUS loans. Like that’s the most clickbait shit I’ve ever seen.
