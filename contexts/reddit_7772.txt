My friend tried to scoop me :(
This is really really not supposed to be a humble brag, but I have a research idea that is SO exciting and novel to me. My advisors are genuinely pumped and one even said, “this could be career breaking”.

I know I’m WAY ahead of myself and everything could crash and burn, but I was so freaking amped I talked to a confidant and my closest friend in the program. This was about a month ago and I was basically gushing about the line of research I wanted to start. Probably annoying lol but I couldn’t contain my excitement and she’s in my field and knew she would understand what I was talking about. 

Apparently she talked to my advisor about a very similar idea this weekend. He then emailed the both of us and basically said I had that exact idea - I think to call her out and to also help me stake my claim on the idea. I offered in the email back to everyone to meet and bounce ideas off each other but I’m so angry. I really thought she had my back. She completely posed the idea as her own. It would have been different if she had reached out and said she wanted to collaborate.

I’m so fortunate my advisor stuck up for me. I don’t know if or how I should talk to my “friend” about this. As of now, I have replied to the email confirming it was my idea and left the door open for collaboration just to be nice. 

What should I do? Should I speak directly to this person who posed the idea as her own? Let it go and use it as motivation to get my projects started? Speak to my advisor privately? 

Sorry I’m just completely blindsided about how blatant the stealing was.
