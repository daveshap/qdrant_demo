JODY: Go sit next to him.
SANDY: Who?
JODY: Mark Shale.
SANDY: Why?
JODY: Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
SANDY: I don't watch him eat everyday.
JODY: You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
SANDY: The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
JODY: You eventually have to talk to him.
SANDY: Why? All my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.
