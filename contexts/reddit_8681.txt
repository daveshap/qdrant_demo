Does Virginia's adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment make it law?
The proposed [Equal Rights Amendment](https://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faqs) attempts to legally eliminate all gender-based discrimination. Section 1 explicitly states that: 

>Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.

On January 27th, the [Virginia legislature finalized the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-expected-to-finalize-passage-of-era-monday-setting-stage-for-legal-fight/2020/01/27/b178265c-4121-11ea-b503-2b077c436617_story.html) and became the 38th - and potentially final - state to ratify the amendment. 

The [original deadline](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Equal-Rights-Amendment) for ratification was March 1979, which was later extended to June 1982. Supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment claim that ["because the deadline is in the preamble that proposes the ERA — not the text of the amendment itself — the deadline doesn't have to be observed"](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/15/796754345/virginia-ratifies-the-equal-rights-amendment-decades-after-deadline). However, the Justice Department posted an [opinion](https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/1232501/download) stating the ERA resolution has expired and is no longer pending before the state. 


What, if any, legal precedent exist to support the pro-ERA supporters belief that the deadline does not apply? What, if any, legal precedent exist to support the Justice Department's view that the resolution has expired?
