If Trump colluded with the Russians and fired Comey to hide his collusion, is that a crime?
I want to be clear that I am not judging whether he did or did not do so.  Nor am I asking whether it would be an impeachable offense (i.e., a "high crime or misdemeanor").  I just want to know whether it would be a crime in the ordinary sense of the world.

[Here's an opinion piece](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-administration/334100-opinion-a-special-counsel-is-the-wrong-way-to-uncover) by Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz arguing that this worst case scenario would not be a crime on the part of the President.  

On the other hand, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) [says "what we saw in the last two weeks is obstruction of justice, a federal crime, staring all of us in the face."](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/334400-dem-lawmaker-trumps-federal-crime-staring-all-of-us-in-the-face)  And Lieu did not even comment on whether colluding with Russia was a crime.

Even if Lieu is a bit hasty in his judgment, is he at least right that Trump's actions, if they involve collusion with Russia and firing Comey to cover up such collusion, *could* be a crime in the ordinary sense of that word?  Or is Dershowitz right that the President has the right to fire the Director of the FBI and that even if he was covering up collusion he was not committing a crime?
