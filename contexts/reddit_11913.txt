I feel like I picked the wrong guy to be my roommate.
Sooo I put out a Craigslist add for a roommate and there was only one response that seemed normal. So I hung out with him and he seems alright, but I also previously denied my good friend the room because my last roommates were my friends and they fucked me over. Now that its coming down to it, I wish I let my friend have it. :/
