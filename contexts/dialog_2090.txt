RATH: I killed him.
ELECTRA: Why?
RATH: Because that's how it works. That's what it's about. He was the best. He was on top.
ELECTRA: Where you wanted to be?
RATH: Yes. As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top. That's all there is. Until then, there is nothing. You are nothing.
ELECTRA: How did you get into the business?
RATH: The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
ELECTRA: The C.I.A.?
RATH: More or less.
ELECTRA: How old were you?
RATH: They recruited me when I was in high school.
ELECTRA: Jesus -- why?
RATH: Languages. I was already fluent in nine languages.
ELECTRA: You were like a boy genius?
RATH: Some people said that. I never thought so.
ELECTRA: Why not?
RATH: I was just different.
ELECTRA: You went from high school to the Agency?
RATH: No. I graduated from George Washington University. Then I entered the Agency training program.
ELECTRA: They didn't give you a choice, did they?
RATH: No, they didn't.
ELECTRA: But you knew what they were training you for?
RATH: Of course. I was going to be James Bond.
ELECTRA: Ahhhh...
RATH: They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive. The training, the weapons, the travel --
ELECTRA: The exotic women.
RATH: Women? No... not really.
ELECTRA: Why not?
RATH: Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
ELECTRA: Why?
RATH: Because you are a women.
ELECTRA: Why did you leave the Agency?
RATH: The same reason everyone does. You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
ELECTRA: They tried to kill you?
RATH: Yes. It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
ELECTRA: Then you went freelance?
RATH: The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money. Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
ELECTRA: Tell me about the first time.
RATH: My first take?
ELECTRA: Yes.
RATH: Why?
ELECTRA: Because I want to know.
RATH: It was... mechanical. Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
ELECTRA: Are they usually like that?
RATH: No. Just the first one.
ELECTRA: After that?
RATH: They become complicated... messy.
ELECTRA: Did it ever bother you?
RATH: Did it ever bother James Bond?
ELECTRA: That's fiction.
RATH: This is fiction! Don't you see that? This is another reality. And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them! They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks! Do you understand what I am saying? No one is innocent -- including you!
ELECTRA: Does that mean it didn't bother you?
