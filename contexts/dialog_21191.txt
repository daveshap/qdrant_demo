BRANDON: You'll be safe here. I won't be long. Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there. You can make coffee if you like.
BETTY: This must have cost a fortune.
BRANDON: It did, but it never paid off-- until now. I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
BETTY: Do you have to leave the note?
BRANDON: It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
BRANDON: I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
BETTY: You wouldn't like it. I've been there.
BRANDON: My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
BRANDON: Well?
BETTY: You leave it.
