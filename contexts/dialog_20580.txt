EVELYN: Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it. Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
RAFE: The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it. But I've got to because it's true. I love you. That must surprise you.
EVELYN: It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
RAFE: There's one thing I have to say. I'm going away.
EVELYN: We're all going away.
RAFE: I'm going to the war. The real war. Hitler's taken Europe. The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine. And not just there, but here.
EVELYN: But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
RAFE: Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F. They need pilots, and we need experience. I leave tomorrow.
EVELYN: You waited til tonight to tell me?
RAFE: I had to tell you in person. Because there's something else I need to say.
RAFE: Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable. What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that. If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
EVELYN: I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
RAFE: Maybe not. But I need you to know. I love you. And I will come back. I'll find a way. And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
EVELYN: Do one thing for me, before you go.
