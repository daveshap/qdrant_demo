I’m struggling with employment at the moment
The title basically says it all but I’m struggling with employment at the moment. I’m a 16 year old and I live in Australia so our job hiring is obviously going to be different. I’m looking for casual work to just get a start and especially since Christmas is coming I thought I would have a chance. I had a job a few months back but my anxiety got so bad I had to quit (I worked in a busy cafe) since I’ve had a bit of trouble trying to get employed, I’ll apply and get an interview or they’ll see my application but nothing happens. Is there any advice people can give me to do a bit better?
