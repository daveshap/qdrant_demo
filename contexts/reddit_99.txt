Is it possible to change how someone feels about you?
I (14m) have a crush on my bestfriend (14f) and she knows it but doesn't feel anything towards me like that. We are able to call eachother names and laugh it off which I love and she helped me through so much shit ever since I met her, so if anyone knows ways to convince someone then please help
