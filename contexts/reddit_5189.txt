Best way to keep positive during the hunt?
Hello this type of question has likely been asked before but I feel like I need to ask for advice 

Im 25 and graduated 3 years ago in HR management with college qualifications in administration. Ive since then been trying to seek out work in theses area but have only been able to find part time roles in retail as pretty much every role in my area (north scotland) is demanding multiple years experience for basic entry roles even in some volunteer roles. I tried a shift in career in labwork in optical but was made redundant and replaced by someone with over 15 years experience 3 months ago and been applying for new work since working with the job centre and friends. 

Ive had a few interviews but Im starting to feel extremely drained after multiple rejections from interviews this week alone or applied jobs over the last few months let alone the past years

And thus I ask for those in a similar state or been through one your best advice to keep at it as Im struggling to get going on some days now

Many thanks
