MIMI: How are you?.... Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now.... No, she isn't here. Is it about her father? Well, can I take the message?
DOROTHY: Give it to me.
MIMI: Oh, here she is.
NICK: I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
DOROTHY: Oh, thank heaven.
MIMI: What is it? Has he found him?
DOROTHY: Do you know where he's living? Oh.... Well, at least I'm glad he's all right. Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
MIMI: What is it?
DOROTHY: Nothing.
MIMI: That isn't true. It was about your father. Where is he?
DOROTHY: He's all right. Isn't that enough?
MIMI: No.
DOROTHY: You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more. He made a big settlement on you.
MIMI: That's gone long ago. I've got to see him. Where is he?
DOROTHY: I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
