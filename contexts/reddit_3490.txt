This guy I was seeing told me he doesn't do relationships or intimacy but that we should keep seeing each other
So I said "PEACE."

I've honestly heard this so many times in the past three/four years. These dudes want all the benefits of a relationship without any commitment or putting work in. 

I'm tired of compromising my own needs and desires because someone else likes the attention/sex/company. 

It's the first time I haven't just reluctantly entered a situation I didn't wanna be in where I knowingly end up getting hurt just because I want to try to make things work. I'm actually so proud of myself for having the self-respect to dip from that before I got even more invested. It was a really really hard decision to make.

Here's hoping I'll stick with it.
