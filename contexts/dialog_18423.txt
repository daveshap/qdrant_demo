SAUNDERS: It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
JEFFERSON: Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
SAUNDERS: Well, I guess it's a chance.
JEFFERSON: Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little-- And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
SAUNDERS: I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*!
JEFFERSON: Wait--
SAUNDERS: What you *have* to do is fight!
JEFFERSON: But--I've done everything I--
SAUNDERS: I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
JEFFERSON: Oh--Saunders--
SAUNDERS: Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
JEFFERSON: Saunders--if there was *any* way--
SAUNDERS: We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
JEFFERSON: Yay!
SAUNDERS: Hurray!
JEFFERSON: Where do we go from here?
SAUNDERS: To a hard night's work, son. Come on!
