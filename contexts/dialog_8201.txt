DEAN: I know.
RACHEL: The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
DEAN: You being audited?
RACHEL: For the last four years.
DEAN: My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
RACHEL: You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
DEAN: That's temporary.
RACHEL: Bullshit.
DEAN: Rachel--
RACHEL: We're screwed.
DEAN: I'm gonna fix it.
RACHEL: How?
DEAN: Tell me about Brill.
RACHEL: I can't.
DEAN: You have to.
RACHEL: I've never met him?
DEAN: Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
RACHEL: Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
DEAN: I <u>did</u> care how.
RACHEL: This conversation's over.
DEAN: What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
RACHEL: I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
DEAN: I'm sorry about that.
RACHEL: What makes you think it's you?
DEAN: It's not me?
RACHEL: You're a moron, you know that?
DEAN: Yeah.
