I met the guy who will be my boyfriend
So I'm single for not THAT long. Before that I was in a relationship for 10 years, with the three last years long distance. Our relationship was over long before we ended it for real. So, at 26 years old, I've never been single as an adult, never add other experiences. 

I started dating for fun, casual things, just for the experiences. I didn't want to jump in another relationship right away.

But yesterday I met the guy who will be my boyfriend, I can bet both my hands on that. We talked and we have so much in common. And he is 110% my type physically. I feel like a dumb teenager who have a big crush for the first time.

I bet you that in a couple months, I will go back on this sub and will tell you how my new boyfriend is awesome ;)

I feel it in my guts that it's him.
