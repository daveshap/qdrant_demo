MRS MATHEWS: I think about it everyday. But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
WELLES: It's been six years.
MRS MATHEWS: What am I supposed to do? Forget her? Time heals all wounds, right? She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that. But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her... ... or her being dead and me knowing... I'd choose to know.
