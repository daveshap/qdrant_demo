EVE: Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
LUTHOR: What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too? What's in it?
ALBERT: There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
LUTHOR: Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
EVE: Again???
LUTHOR: First the pets, Otis.
LUTHOR: Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
ALBERT: Nobody else.
LUTHOR: Shut up, apple-polisher.
