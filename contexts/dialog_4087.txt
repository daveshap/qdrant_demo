DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
JEFFREY: Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Not yet.
JEFFREY: Oh my God. Is her son OK?
F.B.I. MAN: We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
JEFFREY: He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
F.B.I. MAN: You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
JEFFREY: Yeah. I guess I did. What's going to happen to me?
F.B.I. MAN: We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
JEFFREY: Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
