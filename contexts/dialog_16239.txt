GARY: Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
BARRY: Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
GARY: Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
BARRY: It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
DEAN: Like what?
BARRY: Like antiques.
DEAN: Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
BARRY: If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
GARY: So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
BARRY: You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
GARY: I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
BARRY: Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
GARY: I hate these Southern shites.
BARRY: Fucking Northern monkeys.
DOORMAN: Invitations.
EDDY: Invitations?
DOORMAN: Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
EDDY: Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
DOORMAN: All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
EDDY: Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
DOORMAN: Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
