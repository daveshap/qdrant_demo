EVELYN: Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
BLACKBURN: If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
PRICE: -- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
EVELYN: Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
PRICE: Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
EVELYN: Really? Well, let it rip.
PRICE: Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
EVELYN: -- the sadistic prick --
PRICE: -- in the act.
SARA: Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
PRITCHETT: Believe me, we need to.
SARA: Pritchett, this lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery
PRITCHETT: The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
SARA: No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
PRITCHETT: You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
SARA: Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
