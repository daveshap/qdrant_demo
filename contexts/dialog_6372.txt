JERRY: Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
LIZA: Don't tell me you're naked back there.
JERRY: Figure of speech. Could we go?
JERRY: What took so long? You were in there all day.
LIZA: That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out. A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
JERRY: Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald. Another lunatic acting alone,
LIZA: Oswald was an assassin. You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
JERRY: If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
LIZA: Right. Sit up so I can see you.
JERRY: Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
LIZA: Them who?
JERRY: Change lanes. Then watch your rearview.
JERRY: Flat, wraparound headlights?
LIZA: Yeah.
JERRY: Crown Victoria. F.B.I. car. A legitimate tail.
LIZA: As opposed to?
JERRY: People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
LIZA: You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
JERRY: Yes.
LIZA: That's how a man would do it. I'm not a man.
JERRY: I noticed.
