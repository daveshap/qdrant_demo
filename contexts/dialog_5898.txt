EVELYN: She's too upset.
GITTES: What about?
EVELYN: Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
GITTES: You mean she just found out?
EVELYN: Yes.
GITTES: That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
EVELYN: What does it look like?
GITTES: Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
EVELYN: You're insane.
GITTES: Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
EVELYN: You won't go to the police if I tell you?
GITTES: I will if you don't.
