CLERK: Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
FLETCH: You're kidding.
CLERK: Would you like me to change anything?
FLETCH: So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
CLERK: We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
FLETCH: Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
