MAUDE: A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
HAROLD: Well, I really don't drink...
MAUDE: Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
HAROLD: Thank you.
MAUDE: Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
HAROLD: Thank you.
HAROLD: What's that?
MAUDE: My umbrella? Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition. A long time ago.
HAROLD: What were you fighting for?
MAUDE: Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier. Later, Frederick would chide me about it. He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
