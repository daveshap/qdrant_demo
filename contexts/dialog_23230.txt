MILLS: So they ran our list.
SOMERSET: If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you. It might give us a name.
MILLS: Yeah. Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
SOMERSET: Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office. We've got pizza.
MILLS: How do you know all about this?
SOMERSET: I don't. Neither do you.
MILLS: This is a waste of time.
SOMERSET: We're focusing.
MILLS: I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
SOMERSET: The Divine Comedy. A History of Catholicism. A book called Murderers and Madmen.
MILLS: Modern Homicide Investigation. In Cold Blood. Of Human Bondage. Human Bondage?
SOMERSET: It's not what you think it is.
MILLS: The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
SOMERSET: That is.
MILLS: The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
SOMERSET: Saint Thomas Aquinas. He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
MILLS: You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
SOMERSET: That's what it says. Jonathan Doe.
MILLS: This is stupid. It'd be just too easy.
SOMERSET: We'll take a look at him. Talk to him.
MILLS: Sure. Uh, excuse me... are you by any chance a serial killer? Oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if it's okay.
MILLS: What are you going to say?
SOMERSET: You do the talking. Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
MILLS: Who told you about my silver tongue? You been talking to my wife?
