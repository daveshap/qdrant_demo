COLE: You were in my dream just now. Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
RAILLY: We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours. What was the dream about?
COLE: About an airport...before everything happened. It's the same dream I always have -- the only one. I'm a little kid in it.
RAILLY: And I was in it? What did I do?
COLE: You were very upset. You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
RAILLY: It wasn't me before, James. It's become me now because of...what's happening. Please untie me.
COLE: No, I think it was always you. It's very strange.
RAILLY: You're flushed. And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever. What are you doing?
