REV. SULLIVAN: The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
JAMIE: He wants help with his lines --
JAMIE: By accident --
REV. SULLIVAN: Jamie, he's careless. Reckless. Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
JAMIE: I'm supposed to always be alone?
REV. SULLIVAN: I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
JAMIE: Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
REV. SULLIVAN: I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
JAMIE: Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
JAMIE: I know. Don't say anything.
LANDON: He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
JAMIE: You think so.
LANDON: Know so.
