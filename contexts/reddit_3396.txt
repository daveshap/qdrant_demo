I started dating a guy who has his shit together
I feel like every guy i meet either don't have a job, or are lazy as hell, messy, doesn't know how to do basic things like dishes or laundry. 

But I just started seeing a guy who lives on his own, has his own car, has a good job, keeps a clean place and knows how to adult. 

He might be a robot. 

I will update.

Update: Hes 5'7. All of you stop crying about height.

Update 2: It has now been 1 month since we started seeing each other. He has introduced me to so many things i have never done before (like ice fishing, riding a motorcycle, archery) He is always so fun and active but he also give me my own life.  If i am out with friends, he doesn't blow up my phone checking in the whole night. He just lets me live my life and is happy I'm having a good time. So far he is quite amazing, full 360 from my last relationships. He's so attentive to my needs and we have a rediculous amount in common but are so different at the same time. This could actually become something amazing.
