Dearest Employers—a message from struggling college grads.
Dear employers:
Unless you are hiring for a senior, executive, or maybe manager position... please stop requiring every job above minimum wage to already have 3-10 years experience in that exact field.

Only older generations are eligible for these jobs because of it (and because they got these jobs easier when these years-to-qualify factor wasn’t so common).

It’s so unfair to qualified (as in meets all other job requirements such as the college degree and skills required) millennials struggling on minimum wage straight out of college because you require years of experience for something college already prepared and qualified us for. 

And don’t call us whiners for calling it unfair when I know for a fact boomers got similar jobs to today straight out of college. Employers are not being fair to the last decade of college graduates by doing this. Most of these employers themselves got their job way back when such specific experience wasn’t a factor.

And to add onto this:
Employers that require any college degree for a job but only pay that job minimum wage are depressingly laughable. That is saying your want someone’s college skills but you don’t think they deserve to be able to pay off their student debt.

This is why millennials are struggling.
You people make it so most of us HAVE to struggle. Stop telling us we aren’t trying hard enough when your rules literally make it impossible for us to even get started.

We cannot use our degrees to work and earn more money if you won’t even let us get started.

THAT is why so many people are struggling and why so many of us are depressed. Being five years out of college, still working minimum wage, because a job won’t hire you because you don’t already have experience for the job you’re completely otherwise qualified for.
