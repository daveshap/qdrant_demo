SOJEF: We came here from a solar system on the verge of self- annihilation... where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a new home... a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds. That was three hundred and nine years ago.
PICARD: You've not aged a day since then?
SOJEF: Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.
ANIJ: There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
PICARD: We've... just begun to. I suppose you're seventy-five.
