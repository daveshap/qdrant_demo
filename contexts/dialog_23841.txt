EVELYN: Miles.
MILES: Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
EVELYN: How's the trip?
MILES: Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
EVELYN: Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
MILES: And?
EVELYN: And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
MILES: Huh.
EVELYN: I'm sorry, Miles. So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
EVELYN: Are you there? Miles?
MILES: Yeah, I'm here.
EVELYN: I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper. Tell him I'll call back.
MILES: So I guess that's it.
EVELYN: You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
