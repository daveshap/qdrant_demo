GEORGE: Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
ROBIN: No. Why? I like to be with Sam.
GEORGE: It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore. I'd hate to have them bored.
ROBIN: I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
GEORGE: How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
ROBIN: What is it with this? They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here! He has no time!
ROBIN: Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us? She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing! What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there! He's not there! And when he is, he isn't! So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George. I'll stop coming. But it won't be because of Peter. It'll be because you asked me to stop. Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
GEORGE: I'd rather you not be here.
ROBIN: I thought we were helping.
GEORGE: I can hire workers to help me.
