I'm ruining my own life because I don't seem to care about my future anymore.
I've always had a bit of a problem with procrastination. And I have ADHD on top of it.

College started out great. Made a lot of friends, got to learn cool things, etc. However, it has slowly but surely been getting worse and worse and worse, and it's entirely my own fault. I made mostly A's and B's my freshman year. But starting in sophomore year, I got more and more C's. My GPA within my major is horrible. 

All this because I can't seem to make myself do *anything* anymore. Even this very moment, I should be starting a take home exam I had a week to do, which is now a day late. An EXAM. I want to make good grades, I made fantastic grades in high school. But I just can't seem to make myself put in the effort...

This all has been taking a huuuuge toll on my self-esteem. I used to think of myself as smart, competent, and at least somewhat responsible. Now I'm sort of a worthless person. I can't study for shit, can't work for shit. I haven't had ADHD medication since the last semester of my freshman year, and I keep wondering if that has something to do with it. But I was never really that severe of a case, never needed anything but a tiny dose of medication. Do I want amphetamine to be the magic solution anyway? Am I that useless without drugs?

I'm sort of teetering on the edge of a breakdown. This is what I do. Pretend everything is okay until I can't ignore it anymore, then break down (dramatically). I'm sort of concluding that I must not care about my own future anymore, because I'm pretty much doing the opposite of anything that would help it. I can't see myself in the future, at all. I'm finding myself questioning how much of a future I want anyways...
