How does being fired from a job affect one's future job possibilities?
Like the title says. I'm not overly worried or anything, I just have that nagging question in the back of my head. I'm currently in the process of searching for my first job (highschooler here) and the prospect of being fired for a mistake I make has always been a slight issue of my overall mindset while looking for a job. Stuff like "Will future employers look down on me being fired", "What kind of mistake would it take for me to be fired", etc.. It's just something I've always wondered.

Thanks for any replies!
