How fast do nuclei need to be traveling when colliding for them to break apart? I don't mean fission or fusion reactions with uranium or such.  I mean gold or lead or even hydrogen collisions, such as in these particle colliders or outer space, wherein the nuclei seem to touch, and possibly break apart.
