NORMA: Why... yes.
ED: Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
NORMA: I suppose. It's very expensive.
ED: It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
NORMA: What are you, an angora wholesaler?
ED: No, I work in pictures. I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
NORMA: Ah, c'mon! Nobody does all that.
ED: Two people do. Orson Welles and me.
NORMA: Wow.
ED: You know, you're a very attractive girl.
NORMA: My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
ED: You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth. Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
