STELLA: What is it that I can't figure?
PADEN: What do you mean?
STELLA: Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
PADEN: What makes you say that?
STELLA: If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
PADEN: You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
STELLA: Nah! What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it? Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
PADEN: Is that what he said? Well, he figured it okay this time.
