KELLY: So, you just get here?
SEAN: Yeah, from Boston.
KELLY: I was seeing this guy off. He flew in from Dallas. Wants to marry me. He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
SEAN: Massachussettans aren't.
KELLY: 'Course they're also so rich.
SEAN: ... Massachussettans aren't.
KELLY: How long you staying?
SEAN: I don't know, it depends.
KELLY: You like Florida?
SEAN: I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
KELLY: Well, wait till you see the rest.
KELLY: You gonna work at The Kingdom?
SEAN: Depends on big brother.
KELLY: I'm a water-skier.
SEAN: Are you really?
KELLY: Sure am.
SEAN: That's too bad. I don't like water. I don't like being around in. I never go in it.
KELLY: How come?
SEAN: Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't. I can't even drink it.
MIKE: Come on, let's go.
SEAN: Something wrong?
MIKE: You know Overman?
KELLY: Musclehead?
MIKE: He's missing.
KELLY: Hope with none of my girl friends.
MIKE: Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while? Show him around for me?
KELLY: Sure. No problem.
MIKE: Thanks.
