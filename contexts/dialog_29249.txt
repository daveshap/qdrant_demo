MARSH: Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
HARRY: Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
SUZIE: Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
GIDEON: No, I'm too hot now.
SUZIE: You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
GIDEON: I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it. Son, you make me wish I was dead.
SUZIE: Gideon, don't say things like that.
BABE BROTHER: Why does he always pick on me?
LINDA: He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
BABE BROTHER: I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.
