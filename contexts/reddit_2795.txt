I'm 23 have a BS in Biology and a contract job ending soon, what should be my next move?
I graduated last year with a BS in Biology and a minor in Psychology. I've been working in a chemistry lab over the last year to pay off my loans but the contract is ending. I want to get involved with either Psychedelic Research or a startup, but I don't know where to go or what to do because of Covid. I also can't decide if going back to school for a Masters is worth it if I haven't felt out either path. Either way I would likely have to move away from home which I am comfortable with.  I was originally hoping to spend this next year teaching english abroad but that doesn't seem to be a possibility right now.
