SEBASTIAN: This isn't working out for me anymore.
ANNETTE: Yeah, me neither.
SEBASTIAN: It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
ANNETTE: What are you saying?
SEBASTIAN: Why aren't you understanding?
ANNETTE: I love you.
SEBASTIAN: I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
ANNETTE: Why are you trying to hurt me?
SEBASTIAN: I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
ANNETTE: You don't know how to love.
SEBASTIAN: You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
ANNETTE: But you knew this was important to me.
SEBASTIAN: What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
