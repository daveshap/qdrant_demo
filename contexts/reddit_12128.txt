Best friend having self worth issues
hey so basically my best friend is struggling to accept that he's wanted and not a disappointment to his friends and family and I've told him of how much he isn't and that he's great. he also told me that he has suicidal tendencies when drunk and that worries me. 

I've asked him if he might be depressed but he denied it so I ask if he could be bipolar instead since he says that his moods about himself constantly change like he could be happy and then sad at the same time and he denied that too. I asked him if he could consider taking those online tests but he didn't reply and hasn't since like a few days ago.

something to note however is that he always just reads but never replies to my texts since even way before which annoys me but that's not the main point. anyways, he has since then tweeted more sad stuff but im not sure what else to do really except to give him space
