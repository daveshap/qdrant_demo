GALE: Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
KENNY: You want to go live?
GALE: No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
KENNY: When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
GALE: If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
KENNY: But it's so much easier when we make it up.
GALE: Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
TATUM: Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
SIDNEY: But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
