OLD MAN: Be careful.
DANTE: I'm trying.
OLD MAN: You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
DANTE: So I'm told.
OLD MAN: I had a friend that used to chew glass for a living. In the circus.
DANTE: And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
OLD MAN: No, he got hit by a bus.
DANTE: Oh... Can I help you?
OLD MAN: Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
DANTE: Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
OLD MAN: I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
DANTE: Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
OLD MAN: Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
DANTE: The white kind.
OLD MAN: I'm not asking about the color. I mean is it rough or cottony?
DANTE: Actually, it is kind of rough.
OLD MAN: Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
DANTE: Yeah, but...
OLD MAN: Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
DANTE: Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
OLD MAN: Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
OLD MAN: Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there... to read? It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.
DANTE: Jesus... go ahead.
OLD MAN: Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
DANTE: You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
OLD MAN: Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
DANTE: I said go ahead.
OLD MAN: No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
DANTE: The porno mags?
OLD MAN: Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
DANTE: Here. Now leave me alone.
OLD MAN: Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
