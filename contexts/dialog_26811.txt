DAVID: Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
EMMI: When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
DAVID: When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
EMMI: I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
EMMI: Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
STEVE: Do you know where the Adagio begins?
EMMI: Of course.
STEVE: Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
FURTWÄNGLER: It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
STEVE: Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
