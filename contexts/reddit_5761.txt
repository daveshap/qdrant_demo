Sent out hundreds of resumes, got rejected from the two jobs that bothered to put effort into me. Now starting the whole process all over and I feel absolutely exhausted and crushed.
I feel like an absolute failure. I have a good degree, did a bunch of things outside of school, worked for a leading health organization in another country for a few months, yet can’t find a job in the US. It’s so freaking dehumanizing to go through all this effort. I had my hopes up for one job and just got the rejection call. I feel hopeless and lost. I need to move and get out of my hometown. I’m falling behind all my friends. I had all these high expectations of myself that I can’t even meet, and might need to realize I’ll never be as good or talented as I wanted to be.

Am right back to submitting endless applications, and completely not looking forward to probably ANOTHER 6 month long search with no end in sight.
