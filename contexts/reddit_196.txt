Tad confused in regards to recent changes(not sure if really late puberty)
When I say late puberty I'm male and currently almost 17 and all around the same time things that often take place during puberty have started. First off I went through puberty within the space of a few months when I was 11, It took 3 days for my voice to fully break(freaked the hell out of everyone) and a further 3 months aprox for leg hair ect. However I never developed an attraction to girls nor facial hair(I also stopped growing but that might be normal I'm 5 foot 10). During the summer a few things happened: first I began to grow facial hair, second after my emotions going a tad haywire(bouncing between depression and hyperactivity for almost a month) I started to realize that I'm now finding girls attractive, Despite having stopped growing while I was 12 recently my shoulders are becoming wider and my arms longer, I also have been told that my face has started to become narrower and that I appear to be losing weight(I'm quite healthy in regards to weight but suddenly my apatite is bigger and I'm told I'm losing weight) This seems similar to what I experienced before I had my growth spurt as a kid.

My main question is does what is happening seem like what I think it is? (Is it possible for puberty to kind of pause for several years?)
