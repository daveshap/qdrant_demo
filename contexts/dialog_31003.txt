TED: Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
MOM: Oh. Goodness.
TED: You're free. You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
MOM: Like what?
TED: Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
DAD: But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
TED: Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
MOM: But who would run the store?
TED: Forget the store. Think big.
DAD: Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
MOM: We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
DAD: We love our lives just the way they are.
