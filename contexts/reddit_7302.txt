Everything seemed wrong
Has anyone felt so useless when they're off to work?

I just joined this new company barely three weeks ago including on job training. And was informed this morning that work for the past week or two weren't up to their expectations.

To add on, they were looking of extending the training period to an additional month or two on top of the initial 4 weeks allocated.

My point is, I'm barely a month here, just start to find my ways or even the policy in place to work and yet was shared I'm not up to standard? The last job I had lasted me over 5 years where I felt drained. And now moving to this company, I thought it'd be better but ended up worst.

My role is basically drafting responses and emails to Organisations regarding the legal aspect or some policy in placed. So the kind of questions I'm asked to deal with varies. They acknowledged that the learning curve might be steep but they are like solely blaming me for my shitty work. Weekends are here and I have 15 over cases just for today and the sla is two working days.

If I take too long to respond, they'll see me as slow and incompetent. If I submit it on the same day, they see me as someone who couldn't care less. I'm really lost at this... I would want to have a good career and prospect just like the one I had before this. But no..... Things are not looking bright.
