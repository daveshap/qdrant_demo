HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Could I have that, please?
DUKE: Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: You realize...
DUKE: Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: That's a strange attitude.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
DUKE: A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
DUKE: How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN: Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
DUKE: I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
