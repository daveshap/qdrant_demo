Why is the two party system in the US so persistent?
In the history of the US, there have pretty much always been exactly two major parties.  A few parties have risen and fallen over the history of the US, but the two-party balance has been remarkably consistent.  For instance, [there are very few periods where any substantial number of third party members hold seats in the House](http://history.house.gov/Institution/Party-Divisions/Party-Divisions/) and third party movements such as the [Know-Nothing party,](http://www.britannica.com/topic/Know-Nothing-party) and the [Bull Moose party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_\(United_States,_1912\)) have been remarkably short lived.

Other countries which use first past the post legislative elections such as Canada and the UK have had persistent third parties at the national level, with the [Liberal Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats) in the UK and [New Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party) in Canada both having substantial enough electoral success even in countries where there are two more dominant national parties.

What are the constitutional or cultural forces which have led to the persistence of only two major national parties existing at a time?
