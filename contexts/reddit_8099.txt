Is there precedence over the past 100 years for the White House to block media outlets from press briefings?
["CNN and other news outlets were blocked Friday from an off-camera White House press briefing"](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/24/media/cnn-blocked-white-house-gaggle/index.html).  According to CNN, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Politico, and Buzzfeed were also blocked.  The Associated Press and Time magazine boycotted the meeting in protest.  

From the same CNN article:

> "The White House Correspondents Association also protested the move.

> "The WHCA board is protesting strongly against how today's gaggle is being handled by the White House," it said in a statement. "We encourage the organizations that were allowed in to share the material with others in the press corps who were not. The board will be discussing this further with White House staff."

Is there precedence in modern history for this kind of selective screening by the White House?
