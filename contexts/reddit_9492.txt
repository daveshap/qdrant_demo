PSA: Seattle to soon provide $800 in supermarket vouchers, first to 6,250 families already enrolled in city-subsidized childcare and food-assistance programs but possibly expanding the program to others impacted by the crisis such as gig workers
The City Council still has to approve the measure, but in my opinion it's incredibly unlikely they will say no.  I am really, really hoping other places follow suit with similar grocery vouchers (at minimum).
