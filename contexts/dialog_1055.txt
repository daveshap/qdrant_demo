EVE: What a day - what a heavenly day...
ADDISON: D-day.
EVE: Just like it.
ADDISON: And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
EVE: Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
ADDISON: Are you that sure of tomorrow?
EVE: Aren't you?
ADDISON: Frankly - yes.
EVE: It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
ADDISON: All paved with diamonds and gold?
EVE: You know me better than that.
ADDISON: Paved with what, then?
EVE: Stars.
EVE: What time?
ADDISON: Almost four.
EVE: Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
ADDISON: You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
EVE: Why not?
ADDISON: The mark of a true killer. Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...
EVE: Why'd call me a killer?
ADDISON: Did I say killer? I meant champion. I get my boxing terms mixed.
