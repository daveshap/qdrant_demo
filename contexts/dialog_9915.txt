HARRY: Where to?
FRANCES: Oh Harry...
HARRY: This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
FRANCES: Yeah. I don't know.
HARRY: You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
FRANCES: I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
