ELIZABETH: What? What's wrong? How will this help us get off the island?
JACK: It won't. It won't, and so we won't.
ELIZABETH: But ... you did it before! Last time --
JACK: Last time, I was here a grand total of three days. Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off. But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again. We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
ELIZABETH: So that's it? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow? You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
JACK: Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
JACK: You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord. We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again. And we've got rum, praise the Lord. We can stay alive a month, maybe more. Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
ELIZABETH: A month? Will doesn't have a month! We've got to do something to help him!
JACK: You're right. Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
JACK: Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth. But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
ELIZABETH: Not when you can drink instead, at least.
