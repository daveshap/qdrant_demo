Discovery Channel movie about a rover entering an organic spaceship, activating a green light that causes black spheres to appear on Earth This isn't something I remember well, but I'll do my best to describe it.I watched this around 2013-2014, on Discovery Channel. It was some kind of movie or TV Show about a hypothetical situation where alien space ship shows up in orbit around the Earth. A rover is sent into the ship to analyze it and find out what the inhabitants look like.The ship's interior was black, with a lot of fragmented sharp edges and a lot of green glowing lights everywhere.At some point the rover activates a glowing green light, like a generator or something (this part is vague in my memory) and through some kind of series of events reveals that the ship isn't piloted by aliens, it is the alien. Activating this light causes a vast amount of black spheres to appear on Earth that then slowly break apart into smaller and smaller spheres.
