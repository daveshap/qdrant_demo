This 17 year old I know just got pregnant
I just wanted to vent about it here,  Maybe if you want to offer your two cents that's fine too. 
But she posts all these pics of herself on FB and then all these guys are like.. cutie, you so fine, aw girl yeah, so sexy! and all this other crap. 
But the post where she is announcing her pregnancy, and only 1 out of the 25 comments are from guys. But where did all the guys go? I want her to learn a lesson, but I'm no longer a big part of her life..
It just pisses me off to think that she's strutting around. A girl with a good head on her shoulders, or so I thought. Blah!!
