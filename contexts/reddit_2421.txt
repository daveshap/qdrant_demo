Why is it so hard to find a job right now?
We keep hearing about how well the economy is doing and the unemployment rate is so low. But I'm legit having more difficulty finding a job now than I did 2 years ago. I've applied for like 100 jobs and have had no luck. I've been to second round of interviews only to have them say no later on.

I go on LinkedIn and I see like 150 applicants for one opening of a job that I'm interested in. Like what in the actual fuck?
