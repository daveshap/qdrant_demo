EDITOR: This is definitely better.
TOBY: You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
EDITOR: This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
TOBY: Yes, I know…But still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
EDITOR: I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
TOBY: No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious…But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
EDITOR: You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
TOBY: Nothing, I guess…
EDITOR: I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
TOBY: OK, you're right, you're right… You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
EDITOR: I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening…
TOBY: OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
EDITOR: We're not ready.
TOBY: Hip alternative types who will understand the process better…
EDITOR: We're not ready!
TOBY: Well, I need to see this with an audience!
EDITOR: What's an audience going to tell you?
TOBY: I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
