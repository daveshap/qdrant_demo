PIKE: Right?
DUNBAR: Yeah...
PIKE: You gotta untie me. I didn't do this thing, Ray.
DUNBAR: You hated West more than any of us.
PIKE: Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
DUNBAR: You're the only one missing a grenade.
PIKE: Which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper. Were you watching your pack on the ride in?
PIKE: Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
DUNBAR: If not you, then who?
PIKE: Mueller.
DUNBAR: Oh, come on --
PIKE: We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
DUNBAR: That's exactly what he says about you.
PIKE: Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
DUNBAR: You hated West, Mueller loved him --
PIKE: Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
DUNBAR: Bullshit.
PIKE: Look in my pack.
DUNBAR: Why?
PIKE: Just look. Little pocket.
PIKE: Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
DUNBAR: You're lying --
PIKE: Pull up my sleeve. Right arm.
