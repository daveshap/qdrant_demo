I slept with one of my best friends crush
Im a 17 years old guy who’s considered ”popular” but im very shy. I was at a party a week ago with a lot of my classmates and friends and everybody was kinda busted because we had been drinking alot.  

I have an inner circle of five friends who i know i can trust with everything. Well apperantly one of those friends have a big crush on a girl from our class but none of us had a clue that he liked her even though we are so close. I noticed that this girl he had a crush on was very interested in me throughout the night. So after a while i said fuck it and we started making out with her and one thing led to another and we ended up in bed and we fucked. 

In the morning one of the other friends in my close friend circle  told me that my other friend who had a crush on her went and cried on the couch when me and her went into the bedroom. The problem with this is that i don’t like her in that kind of way and i only did it because i was drunk af. Because of what i did that friend haven’t talked to me since then and I feel so fucking bad afterwards, do anybody have some advice on what i can say to him now to fix his broken heart?
