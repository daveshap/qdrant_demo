For those living near a Panera Bread
Let me know if it'd be any better to post this on a different sub.

I work at Panera; at the end of the day, we collect and package almost all of our bread and pastries for local charities. I say almost since we still end up tossing ALL of our unused, sliced bread every single night. If nobody shows up for the donated goods, that also ends up in the trash.  


I'm not sure if this is the case for other locations, but I figure that anyone that's low on cash for food might find this information helpful. I feel absolutely awful letting so much food go to waste all the time.
