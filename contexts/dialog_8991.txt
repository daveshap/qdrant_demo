EVE: I know you -- you're the one who called. You're Castor Troy. You killed my son --
ARCHER: -- I called, but I'm not Castor. I'm your husband.
EVE: How did he expect to do that?
ARCHER: An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face. He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything. But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
