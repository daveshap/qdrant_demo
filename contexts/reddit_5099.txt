How do I react on "wrong" feedback in a job rejection?
I recently received a rejection for a job at a company that I'd love to work. As I dropped out without getting an interview, I don't think too much about my chances to work there. Their response bothers me a bit though.

They told me the reason I dropped out was the lack of "story telling" in my CV. 

I appreciate the fact they even wrote a reason, but its not true. My portfolio and CV is full of projects that base on the execution and conception of stories. Its basically my top skill. 

How do I react to this mail? Should I just be quiet and say thank you or is it possible tell them what I think. I don't want to waste my chances for upcoming positions in this company, but I feel like I dropped out for the wrong reasons.
