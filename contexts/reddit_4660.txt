Anyone care to share their experience with MAOIs?
Have been through most of the ssris, all the snris. After years of messing about with meds I finally got a result with Wellbutrin, but there's a supply issue now in Australia and it won't be available here till 2020. I'm getting pretty bad without meds so thought I might try maois. Would be interested to hear about effectiveness -or not - side effects, and dietary issues. Thanks.
