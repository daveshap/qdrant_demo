MARINO: He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
NICKY: Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?
MARINO: He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
NICKY: Yeah, what'd you tell him?
MARINO: I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
NICKY: You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
MARINO: Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
NICKY: Yeah, what's to stop him?
MARINO: I know. I know.
NICKY: I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
MARINO: Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
NICKY: Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'. I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
MARINO: What?
NICKY: Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
MARINO: Oh, he ain't nobody.
NICKY: You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
MARINO: Angelo and Buster.
NICKY: Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
MARINO: They'll do it.
NICKY: And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
MARINO: Yeah.
NICKY: And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
MARINO: Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
NICKY: Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
MARINO: Don't know.
NICKY: Dominick said they're in the motel?
MARINO: Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint.
