Schengen multiple-entry visa validity question I hold an Indian passport.I am planning to apply for a Schengen visa for a short Europe trip in September 2018 for 7 days. This is my first trip in Europe, i.e. my first attempt at getting Schengen visa.Also, I am planning to visit Europe and the UK again in June 2019 during the Cricket World cup in the UK (England and Wales). I will apply for a UK visa in 2019, but can I use my Schengen visa, which I will be getting now, to enter any Schengen country again in June 2019? What is the validity of this visa?Which embassy should I apply for a Schengen visa: the Netherlands, as my longest stay for current trip is in Netherlands?How can I get a Schengen visa that is valid until June 2019, so that I don't need to apply again?
