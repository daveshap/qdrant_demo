BEAUMONT: -build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
PATTERSON: I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
BEAUMONT: You've never built in Africa.
PATTERSON: But I have in India- every country presents problems.
BEAUMONT: You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
PATTERSON: I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
BEAUMONT: Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me. But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment- -don't make me break you.
PATTERSON: You won't have the chance. Any further words of encouragement? Then I've a train to catch.
HELENA: I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
PATTERSON: We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
HELENA: Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
PATTERSON: It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
HELENA: Oh dear- -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
PATTERSON: -well, it's just... ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
HELENA: -oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
PATTERSON: What if there are complications?-
HELENA: -not what if"- there will be
HELENA: Go, now. Such a gentleman.
PATTERSON: I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
