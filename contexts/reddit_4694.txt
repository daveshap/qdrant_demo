Please help, I feel so hopeless
Woke up this morning feeling like absolute shit. It feels as if I have something in my stomach thats heavy. I am suffering from OCD and intrusive tohughts. I recently decided to stop drinking alcohol, because it makes everything worse. I know Im also going to lose some friends because of this, and It just feels so bad! I went to a doctor yesterday and she upped my prozac to 30 mg a day, and im supposed to see a new therapist this week. Im so stressed out by my studies and just life in general.
