ALISON: I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
MITCHELL: Are you still in touch?
ALISON: Not really. The last time I saw her was at that clinic. That was a long time ago.
MITCHELL: Which one?
ALISON: Which one?
MITCHELL: Which clinic?
ALISON: I don't remember the name. It was near a beach.
MITCHELL: Sunnyridge. That was a long time
ALISON: So there were others?
MITCHELL: Other clinics? Oh sure. Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
ALISON: Then...when did she get better?
MITCHELL: She didn't.
ALISON: But you said...
MITCHELL: That's where I'm going. To see her.
ALISON: She's in trouble?
MITCHELL: Yes. Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
STEWARDESS: Some more wine?
MITCHELL: I'm afraid this meat is overdone.
STEWARDESS: I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
MITCHELL: What is it?
STEWARDESS: Poached salmon.
