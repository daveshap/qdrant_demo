Mouse pointer automatically clicks on selection I have a Lenovo Thinkpad X1Carbon (Gen 2) with dual boot - Ubuntu 16.04 and Win7. Recently I started having problems with the mouse/touchpad, and whereever the mouse pointer is on, after 1 or 2 seconds, it acts as if I clicked the mouse and it opens that particular file, app, link or whatever, almost immediately. It is the same if I use the touchpad, mouse or the red dot button in the middle of the keyboard. Disconnecting the mouse and/or turning off the touch pad makes no difference, the pointer still activates any selection made. At first I thought it was a hardware issue but then realized that it only acts this way in Ubuntu, the mouse/touchpad work fine in Win7. As suggested in a FB group, I tried updating the kernel but that didn't change anything. I also searched wiki.archlinux but could not find any similar problem there. Any ideas??
