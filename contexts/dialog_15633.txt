KEVIN: Hey.
KELLY: Kevin. How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
KEVIN: This is business. There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake. Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
KELLY: A tooth?
KEVIN: A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear. They say it looks prehistoric. Like maybe a dinosaur.
KELLY: Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
KEVIN: I want you to go there.
KELLY: Sorry?
KEVIN: I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
KELLY: This is what we do?
KEVIN: I'd like you to check out this lake. See--
KELLY: Are you on drugs?
KEVIN: Kelly--
KELLY: I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
KEVIN: Part of our research--
KELLY: I'm not even a field person.
KEVIN: Well on this one I'd like you to be.
KELLY: This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
KEVIN: It has nothing to do with--
KELLY: I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
KEVIN: <u>Kelly</u>--
KELLY: <u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>. That's ridiculous.
KEOUGH: He just came up screaming.
KELLY: Did he say anything?
KEOUGH: He just kinda gurgled. He was pretty much dead.
KELLY: And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
KEOUGH: The lake was dead calm until up he came. The tooth is in there.
KELLY: <u>There</u>? That's the morgue.
KEOUGH: Yes.
KELLY: Is the dead guy in there?
KEOUGH: That's where they keep them. You want me to bring the tooth out here?
KELLY: Um. No, no. Let's go.
