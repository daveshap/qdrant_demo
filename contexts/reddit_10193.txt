We need some support over at r/Teenagers.
Today, that sub has seen an unnatural spike in suicide notes, and one of them seems to have actually gone through with it. None of us over there have any way of confidently trying to talk these people out of their actions, so I would greatly appreciate it if some of you kept an eye out for any more suicidal teens that appear and help us in our endeavor to prevent any more deaths.
