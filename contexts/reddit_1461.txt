How do you all deal with “everyone at work hates me and I’m sure they’re looking for reasons to fire me” anxiety when you know you’ve never done anything to warrant that?
You know the feeling?
“That group is polite to me, but I’m sure they don’t like me.”
“The boss is friendly, but I’m sure he/she is scrutinizing me for faults”
“I’m sure everybody hates me for that tiny mistake I made once and no one’s forgotten about.”

You feel this way even though there’s no logic behind it and your rational brain tells you you’re the only one hung up on this. Does anyone else deal with this, and how do you cope?
