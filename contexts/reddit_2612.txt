Why do people advise not to put in your 100% effort at work?
For people working in corporate life in the 9-5 grind, I’ve read that you shouldn’t put in 100% or be too productive or else people will just add more work on your plate and not appreciate it. Also people might take advantage of you. Is this generally true? The flip side of the argument is that your boss might find out and sometimes working hard could get you more exposure with new projects. So how do you find the optimal balance between working hard and working just hard enough to get a promotion or salary increase?
