DANTE: I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
RANDAL: Listen to you.
DANTE: I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
RANDAL: Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
DANTE: I can't fucking believe you!!
RANDAL: I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
DANTE: You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
RANDAL: I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
DANTE: Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
RANDAL: So the casket fell over! Big deal!
DANTE: Her fucking body fell out!
RANDAL: So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
DANTE: Just... go! Go open the video store.
