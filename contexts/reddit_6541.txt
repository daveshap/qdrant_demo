I despise Open Concept offices
Can anyone relate? I left a job where I sat at a desk in a row of people for one in which i have my own cubicle, and my anxiety vanished. I sit in a spacey high-wall cubicle now. Im not saying cubicles are nice, but compared to my previous environment, I would take a cube a million times over.

Does anyone know of companies or jobs that haven't fallen victim to the open office "team" environment bs? I am looking to move elsewhere in my career and prefer not to end up in that situation again.
