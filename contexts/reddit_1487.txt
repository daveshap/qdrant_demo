Sweet dreams everyone!
You did good today. You did your very best. Breathe in. Breathe out. Keep Breathing. You are a good person. You are kind. You are loved. You are beautiful. Steady breaths. Close your eyes. Let your mind be good to you, and dream a happy dream.

Edit: I say this to myself every night on days when it's been really stressful. I'm so glad I could help you guys! Thank you so much for the awards!
