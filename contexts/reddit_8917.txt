Iowa caucuses: Ted Cruz wins; Clinton, Sanders tied. O'Malley and Huckabee drop out. Who benefits most?
[Results from the Iowa caucuses](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/01/politics/iowa-caucuses-2016-highlights/) suggest that Ted Cruz bested Donald Trump by a considerable margin on the Republican side and Bernie Sanders is in a statistical dead heat with Hillary Clinton for the Republicans.

So far, O'Malley has dropped out on the Democratic side and Huckabee on the Republican side. More Republicans may drop out in the coming days.

Iowa has the reputation of [setting the tone for campaigns, but not picking future nominees.](http://theweek.com/articles/601149/how-many-iowa-caucus-winners-party-nominees) When all is said and done, who will benefit most from tonight's results and why?
