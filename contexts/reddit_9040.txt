Evaluating the perceptions and realities of public housing
Public housing has not enjoyed much support as a policy mechanism in recent decades under either Republic or Democratic administrations.

Public housing saw a 600% increase in units built between 1949 and 1979, and an 18.2% increase between 1979 and 1994, which almost [exactly kept pace with population growth](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/POPTOTUSA647NWDB). However, the period between 1994 and 2008 saw the demolition of nearly 270,000 units of public housing stock, a decrease of about 19% despite the U.S. population *increasing* 16% over the same period.

Alex Schwartz states "public housing evokes many, mostly negative images in the popular imagination: extreme poverty, grim architecture, neglected grounds, and, not least, crime." [source](https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDcAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=housing+policy+in+the+united+states&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3hsmfhenSAhWL8YMKHa0sA4wQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=housing%20policy%20in%20the%20united%20states&f=false), pg. 163.

Is it true, as Howard Husock writes, that "most policy experts agree these days that big public housing projects are noxious environments for their tenants" and [the cities that surround them](https://www.city-journal.org/html/how-public-housing-harms-cities-12410.html)?

Perhaps these broad declarations of public housing failure go too far and it's merely the isolated, high-rise city projects that have failed, the perspective taken by advocates like [John Atlas, Peter Dreier](http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/77/pubhsg.html) and [Oscar Newman](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=39495).

Perhaps, as some others have argued, public housing has secretly been among the most [effective](http://www.businessinsider.com/5-myths-about-public-housing-2015-9) and [durable](https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDcAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=housing+policy+in+the+united+states&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3hsmfhenSAhWL8YMKHa0sA4wQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=housing%20policy%20in%20the%20united%20states&f=false) programs of poverty alleviation in the country.

So, how effective has public housing been at alleviating poverty and housing burden in the U.S. and other developed nations? Is it a cost efficient program for accomplishing these goals? Does the general impression of public housing reflect the reality? If not, what has caused the disconnect between perception and reality?
