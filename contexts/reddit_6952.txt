Question/Possible advice on getting fired.
Let me first state that this is not my own concern, but the concerns of a dear friend who I would like to help. I am still struggling to find work.

Anyways to make a long story short (and to protect their identify), I had a friend who worked in food service at a somewhat large company. A minimum wage job and an at-will employment. My friend was fired just a few days ago. From my understanding... being at-will gives the employer the right to fire with or without reason/cause, with or without warning (or the time before getting fired), and with or without notice. I would like to talk about the "with or without notice" part.

I understand the first two parts (firing for any or no reason at all and at any given time)... but could the employer fire you while not even bothering to tell you? It got to the point where... 1) my friend was actually fired a little over week ago, 2) still worked five days, 3) the managers/supervisors were confused until they asked the higher ups, and then 4) suddenly they asked for my friends uniform because they fired her a week ago. Is this ethical? It can't be. What should my friend do?
