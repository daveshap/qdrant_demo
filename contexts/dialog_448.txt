YVONNE: I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you. But, you're like a locked safe. You've gotta start dealing with reality.
ALICE: Krueger is reality.
YVONNE: And so is your baby. You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
ALICE: What do you think I'm doing? Look. Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back. He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
YVONNE: All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman. Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
ALICE: Goddamn it, Yvonne! You don't just run away from this guy! He finds you in your dreams.
