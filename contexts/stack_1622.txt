Is a normally high switch the same as a normally closed switch? I'm very much an amateur when it comes to electronics so apologies for the stupid question. I have a switch that is normally high (5V) and then when i hit the mechanical button it drops to 1V. I need to configure my CNC firmware for this. So are these normally open or normally closed switches? To me this would be a normally closed as with a normally open switch you wouldn't have a voltage when the mechanical button is not pressed, but the spec page for my switch says it is normally open so I am confused. Thanks in advance!
