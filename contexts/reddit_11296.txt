My ex(30) that I(25) dated for 5 years but broke up with 3 years ago texted me out of the blue and dodged my questions about his current gf all day
I’m just really annoyed. He’s asking me where I work, where I live, who I talk to. He wanted to know if I was still dating my roommate and was fishing for compliments. He was still trying to keep asking more about me but I just stopped responding. I am so fucking annoyed that he texted. He moved very far away and we have no reason to talk. None. I originally had him blocked but he texted and I didn’t respond and then he contacted my family asking where I was as if we were together. I don’t like that. If I don’t respond it’s because I don’t want to talk to you! Can’t you respect that? I said in an earlier post that I missed him. I really don’t. I loved him but I do not miss dating. He still talks like he’s in 7th grade (he has a masters) and doesn’t understand how to meet a woman’s needs at all. I was reminded of these things today. I would be pissed at my boyfriend if he talked to his ex while being with me like he talked to me today. I feel bad for his current gf. I want him to just leave me alone and stop trying to talk to me.
