COVID-19 news and this pandemic is causing me severe dysfunction
 

'm pretty sure that the traits i had dealt with in 2016 that were PTSD-esque and major depressive during my 9 day mental breakdown are now the same as the ones in 2016. I am losing faith in everything, i have no hope, everything is drastically changed, i have been compromised mental health wise and really believe that this is one of the genuine triggers that could actually push me to commit suicide. I feel like mental health no longer matters to anybody, that i don't matter. i'm obsessively and compulsively obsessing about this social distancing and am even displaying what i suspect are a form of psychosis with really odd beliefs.

I feel like virus is in the air and is near me, and that if i get close to anyone we will all be infected, and the new changes to routine have been so hard. i am experiencing a full blown Anxiety and OCD episode that is characterized by severe derealization and feelings of unreality, mixed with very odd beliefs. I have also felt immense anger, i have felt like i wanted to inflict pain on many people and i have felt very aggressive, i have started mocking the governments and have even started calling for ''Anarchy''

it's easy to see that i am a high risk individual of suffering a breakdown at times like these. I am also experiencing severe side effects of my BPD, and feel this huge sense of abandonment from everyone and its getting to the point i can no longer function

i just wanna be in a coma for 10 months and so i can wake up and all this to be over, this is by far one of the toughest things i have dealt with. I blame the absolute shambolic government who is doing NOTHING TO Support suicidal people in times like these. My brain is in utter shock, i just took two diazepams to calm myself down and feel drowsy.
