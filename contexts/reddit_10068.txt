Online platforms for publishing original SA-related blog posts or articles?
Hey SA community!

What are some good websites or other forums where I can submit a blog post and (hopefully) have it published? I'm not talking about original scholarly research or book reviews, but rather, an article detailing my take on a recent or relevant phenomenon. I noticed a lot of sites (i.e., Inside Higher Ed) post blog posts, but only from well-established sites and not necessarily individuals who do this less frequently. 

Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated!
