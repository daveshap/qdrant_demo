MIRTHA: George. Oh, Jesus Christ, George. Look at you.
GEORGE: Shhh, honey, never mind. It's alright. It's over. I quit the business. I'm out.
MIRTHA: Pablo said no?
GEORGE: Pablo said no. It's all over. And I'm never going back. I have you. We have the baby. And there's nothing else. It's just the family now. Shhh. Sleep now.
