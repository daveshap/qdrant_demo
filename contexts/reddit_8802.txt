Does the State Department Audit Allow For Prosecution Of Hillary
*Mod Note:  We have received a few posts that try and ask this today yet we have not found one that meets our guidelines.  So since our users want to talk about this we have created a post that meets our guidelines.*


The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has released [an audit](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2842429/ESP-16-03-Final.pdf) (PDF) that faults Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State. Here is a [PBS article](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/state-department-email-audit-faults-hillary-clinton/) with more information:

*Hillary Clinton and her team ignored clear guidance from the State Department that her email setup broke federal standards and could leave sensitive material vulnerable to hackers, an independent audit has found. Her aides twice brushed aside concerns, in one case telling technical staff “the matter was not to be discussed further.”*

*The inspector general’s review also revealed that hacking attempts forced then-Secretary of State Clinton off email at one point in 2011, though she insists the personal server she used was never breached. Clinton and several of her senior staff declined to be interviewed for the State Department investigation.*

Although they do also note that others in the same office have followed similar standards:

*"A spokesman for Clinton, who served as the nation’s top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, declared the audit showed her email use was consistent with what others at the department have done.*

*The review encompassed the email and information practices of the past five secretaries of state, finding them “slow to recognize and to manage effectively the legal requirements and cybersecurity risks associated with electronic data communications, particularly as those risks pertain to its most senior leadership.”*

With our recent [META post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4knwqg/meta_reminder_we_reject_submissions_that_are/) in mind about not delving into speculation, can this OIG audit allow for the prosecution of Clinton?
