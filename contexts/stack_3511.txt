Could a VPN server hide all user's information? I'm trying to access some server using VPN(Or generally say, proxy). But sometimes the server could detect that I'm behind a proxy(And sometimes not).So I'm wondering what information could be leaked so that the server can determine that there is a proxy.I have tried the following:CookiesBrowser cacheDNS entryAs far as I know, a VPN can hide all user's information so there won't be any information which can be used to identify the real user.Am I wrong?PS: I have to login the server, so server may still hold some information in session. But it cannot explain why sometimes the server cannot detect my proxy.PPS: I'm not sure that this is the right SE site to ask this question, if I'm wrong, please let me know.
