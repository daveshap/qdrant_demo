Can the paths of photons emitted from the same electron converge? (Correct where applicable)The electromagnetic field can be interpreted as a representation of the magnitude and direction of the force photons will have on another charge.The path a photon takes is the field line (and yes, according to quantum physics a photon takes all possible paths until its wave function breaks down, so the field line of a single photon will have all possible shapes before the wave function collapses).So can the field lines intersect if the light is concentrated, causing the photons to converge upon a point, despite the electromagnetic field intensity having more than one value if the field lines converge?
