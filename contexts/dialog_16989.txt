ARAMIS: Look at us. We are old men now. But once we were young. And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
D'ARTAGNAN: We have grown wiser with age. Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
ATHOS: And some problems cannot be settled without one.
ARAMIS: Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him. As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both. He has already picked the Pope. Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
PORTHOS: But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
ARAMIS: So they tell us. But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression? When no conscience is tolerated? No dissent, no objection?
PORTHOS: It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
ARAMIS: Easy to say, but hard to do. For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
ATHOS: What do you propose to do?
ARAMIS: Replace the king.
