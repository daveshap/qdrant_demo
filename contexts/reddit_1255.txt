I finally did it!
For lunch today I went out to my local McDonald’s, and I actually sat down and ate my food inside, without any friends or family there! 

My main thing is I hate going places alone because I feel like everyone is watching me, but when I was eating I just focused on eating and texting my friends. I’ve been meaning to apply for a job, but I don’t know if I’ll be able to walk into the store to ask about it.
