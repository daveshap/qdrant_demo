How to have a terminal mirrored onto a second screen in a two-monitor setup? I teach using a two-monitor setup, so what I see in my desktop is different from what my audience can see. This works fine for presentations: while the students see the slides, I can see my notes.But I want to use a terminal to run a shell. However, the terminal has to be on my desktop OR on the external screen.Is there a way to show the terminal contents in both screens simultaneously? I don't want to mirror the screens, but stick to the two-monitor mode. Any hints?I'm using Ubuntu with Gnome.
