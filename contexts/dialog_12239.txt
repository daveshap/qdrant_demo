MRS. CHASEN: And what do you do, my dear?
EDITH: I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
MRS. CHASEN: How interesting.
EDITH: Not very.
MRS. CHASEN: Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
EDITH: I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
