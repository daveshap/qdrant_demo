Surving new job with barely any trainint
So i started a new job 2 weeks ago  and really so far the training has been veey poor. They pretty much expect me to figure out everything on my own. I was already supposed to finish a little project for today and couldnt because there ie so much to do and really struggling. Its a very project based analytical role  Sometimes i ask my boss on certain things and he doesnt know either, he redirects me to someone else. They gave a bunch of really big excel files and pretty much trying to figure out everything on my own.

Anyhow, last job i had i quit after 3 months without a new one lined up because really hating what i was doing. I do not want to go through that again.

Any tips? Really worried i will get fired. The workload is also insane. Getting sick and tired of companies to providing adequate training.
