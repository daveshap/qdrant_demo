LARRY: This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
DEIRDRE: Some places, not all. Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food. But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg. Food's not our thing, you see.
LARRY: What is?
DEIRDRE: Best beer in the world known to man or God.
LARRY: Best beer in the world? Budweiser for me, thanks.
DEIRDRE: Budweiser? You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence? That's not beer! Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
LARRY: Oh yeah? Whatta you drink, then?
DEIRDRE: I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
