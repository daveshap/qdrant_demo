Watching old home videos
After recently moving, I am staying at my parents while they are away so I can take care of my dog. I found some old home movies of myself and I couldn't help but to watch. And seeing my family 20-25 years ago was awesome and funny and heartwarming. And, not to brag, but I was a cutie. But, as I watched, I couldn't help but feel a bit melancholy. I was a bubbly, whimsical and hilarious kid. I had an infectious laugh and smile. I always had a smile or look of wonder. I was a strange bird and I didn't give a shit. Just an example, for my 6th birthday party I had a costume party since my birthday is Halloween. All the other girls i invited were princesses, fairies or ballerinas and I...was a bug. I was a happy little girl. And now I am 24 and just...not. Somewhere down the road I lost my sense of wonder. My confidence. My joy. My optimism. My love of life. My laugh and smile. And worse of all, I lost my happiness. I realized just how unhappy I've become in my adult years and I am motivated to change that. I don't know how, but I'm going to get that happiness and joy back. That little girl I saw in the videos would be heart broken if she knew she would grow up to be so depressed and pessimistic. I don't want to spend the rest of my life accepting how I am now. Sorry for the long post. It was an emotional rollercoaster seeing my younger self.
