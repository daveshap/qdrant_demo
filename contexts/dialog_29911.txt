JAMES: What the hell is wrong with you?
LAURA: That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
JAMES: What do you mean?
LAURA: You know it and I know it.
JAMES: What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
LAURA: Everything, but everything.
JAMES: Oh, Laura.
LAURA: Oh
JAMES: You always hurt the ones you love.
LAURA: You mean the ones you pity.
JAMES: Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
LAURA: I do love you. Let's get lost together.
LAURA: Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
JAMES: What?
LAURA: When he finds out.
JAMES: What?
LAURA: Bobby killed a guy.
JAMES: What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
LAURA: You want to see...
JAMES: See what?
LAURA: Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
