IGOR: You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this-- ... I am convinced, is fine.
GOLATILY: Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
IGOR: My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
GOLATILY: She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
IGOR: You will have won the undying gratitude of us all. Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
GOLATILY: I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back.
IGOR: It will always afford me great pleasure to see you.
GOLATILY: Good night, sir.
IGOR: Good night. And I am very grateful to you.
