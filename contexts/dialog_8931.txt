SUSIE: I can't sing it anymore.
FRANK: What?
SUSIE: That song. I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
FRANK: What're you talking about? They love it.
SUSIE: I'm gonna throw up, Frank. I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
FRANK: Susie. It's one more show. One more time. That's all.
SUSIE: And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night. Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
