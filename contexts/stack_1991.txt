Word phonetics suggestion Could any English speaker recommend me the best spelling for an 'invented' word that would be pronounced something like /\u02c8l\u025bv\u026a/. As I'm no expert in phonetic symbols, those phonetic symbols are just approximate. The main concern is that the first syllable sounds more like an 'e' instead of an '\u026a', while the second one is an '\u026a' or 'i\u02d0', instead of an 'a\u026a'.Thanks
