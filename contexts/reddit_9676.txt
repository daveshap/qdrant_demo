Does anyone actually have success using social media to reach students?
Like an account to represent your office/org? Any tips, links, examples, ideas would be appreciated.  I just started a new position in a career services office and part of my role is running their social media.  Right now it is lackluster and does not have much response from students/parents.

Thanks!!!
