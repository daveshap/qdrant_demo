CONAN: Welcome to the show, Scooby.
SCOOBY: Thank you.
CONAN: Nice to have you here.
SCOOBY: Great to be here.
CONAN: And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
SCOOBY: Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
CONAN: Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
SCOOBY: Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
CONAN: TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
