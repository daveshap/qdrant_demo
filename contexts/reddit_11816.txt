The show-off guy who uses the leg curl machine for his feet during pushups.
My gym is organized into four sections. There is a cardio machine area, weight machines area, free weights area and mat area. 
Yesterday was probably the fifth time I see this guy at the gym, who goes to the weight machine area, puts his feet on the seat of the leg curl machine and starts doing pushups with his hands on the ground (legs elevated on the seat). There are various benches in the free weight area that could be adjusted to the same height as the curl seat.
He doesn't need to do it right in the middle of the weight machine area. It is rude. Oh, and each time he does the gym is semi-busy but never so busy that he can't do this in the weight area or the mat area.

Showing off is the purpose I guess but it just makes me so mad. That, and his dirty shoes always leave marks on the leg curl machine seat and the person who uses the machine for its intended purpose has to clean it off :(
