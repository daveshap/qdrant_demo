ELAINE: Are you crazy? You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
KRISTEN: Hi Mom.
ELAINE: Don't hi Mom" me. What are you still doing up? It's past one!"
KRISTEN: I thought I'd wait for you.
ELAINE: Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep. C'mon, angel.
KRISTEN: It's okay, I'm not tired. Really.
ELAINE: Kristen, don't start with me. You know what your shrink said...
KRISTEN: He's full of shit.
ELAINE: I am not going to let you get me into an argument, goddamn it. Not tonight. Now get in bed.
