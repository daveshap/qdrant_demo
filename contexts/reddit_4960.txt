Lockdown: miserable all the time
When I do go out it's an exhausting dance of avoidance and not touching anything. When in I'm with my dad (due to lockdown) and his wife who I avoid and don't like at all and generally seems hostile esp to him.

Feels like the lockdown is eternal, a million days of nothing to look forward to. Shopping feels chaotic.
