MICHAEL: That's not good enough. Why not...?!
ROWAN: I can't leave now. Don't ask me to explain! I just can't!
MICHAEL: I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside! But I'm on the outside now... you put me there!
ROWAN: Michael - please - just. a little longer. Don't leave.
MICHAEL: Why bother to ask, Ro...? Why don't you just make me stay,..?
ROWAN: Stop it!
MICHAEL: How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
ROWAN: You bastard!
MICHAEL: You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...? couldn't you...?! Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...? Answer me!!
ROWAN: Michael - I'm sorry... Just give me -
MICHAEL: No.
