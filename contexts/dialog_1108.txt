DEEP THROAT: I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
WOODWARD: Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
DEEP THROAT: They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
WOODWARD: Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
DEEP THROAT: Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you? Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
WOODWARD: Mitchell knew then.
DEEP THROAT: Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
WOODWARD: Haldeman too?
DEEP THROAT: You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
WOODWARD: Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
DEEP THROAT: Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
WOODWARD: Talk about Segretti--
DEEP THROAT: --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
WOODWARD: There were more then.
DEEP THROAT: Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
WOODWARD: --the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
DEEP THROAT: --don't you miss the grand scheme too.
WOODWARD: How grand?
DEEP THROAT: Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
WOODWARD: And Justice and FBI know all this?
DEEP THROAT: Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
WOODWARD: Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
DEEP THROAT: I was being cautious. You can safely say more then fifty...
