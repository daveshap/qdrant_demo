For the first time in my life I'm not using government assistance.
I was born into poverty. Grew up with free school lunches and food stamps. Once I reached adulthood, it was many years of therapy, doctors, and wasted years trying to find a balance within myself to overcome childhood trauma. 

Two months from my 34th birthday, this last Friday, I reported my new income to DSHS and will no longer recieve food stamps. I also signed on to my new job's medical insurance. 

I am gainfully employed (only because I live VERY humbly) with a credit score of 730. No debt other than a car loan and two credit cards that I monitor and pay off monthly. 

It's something I felt like celebrating, but still feel a bit of shame about how long it took me. This sub has always been great and given me a good push. 

Thank you all. â™¡
