Those of you with research with practical applications; how do you intend to move into the professional world?
I don't want to talk too much about my own research since I'm more curious to what other people are doing, rather than asking advice on my situation, I guess. But here we go.

My masters thesis, and most likely my PhD dissertation, is focused on a particular concept within linguistics that I'm expecting to have pretty practical applications within the military, and perhaps in other domains as well. I don't want to say I'm "pioneering" anything, but I'm certainly in a niche that is not thoroughly explored in any capacity. 

Grad students looking at the future professionally -- especially in social sciences like mine -- are told that tenure track positions are few and far between, so I've spent a lot of time thinking about other ways I can utilize my experience in the job field, but I mean, don't we all just want to do the research we love and nothing else? 

So I'm curious, for those of you who have research that has practical applications, or have research that is innovative to some degree, how do you translate that to the professional world outside of "I'm a professor now", what do you plan on doing, where you can utilize and continue to develop your research in the scope of it's purpose and what it was meant to be used for? How do you find people that want you *because of your research* rather than want you because of your degree, if that makes sense? Or how do you get them to find you?
