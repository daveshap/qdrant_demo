Terminating punctuation in table entries I always get a little flustered by the question of how to punctuate the end of each of my table entries, where the table is part of a longer document primarily composed of traditional sentences but that has other tables, as well. Consider a typical table of mine, where column 1 has very brief entries (for instance, a name or an ID); column 2 has description cells, where at least one of the entries is long enough to require a period; column 3 cells are populated with data type (for instance, long, int, string, and so forth); and column 4 has various cells each of which simply reads \"optional\" or \"mandatory.\"Without column 2, there would be no reason to add a final period to the end of any cell, but I can't just get rid of column 2, after all. There is a general principle of consistency in tables, but if I'm highly consistent, the table looks ridiculous with all of those periods. My gut tells me to be reasonable and include final periods only in column 2. That always strikes me as the least of all evils and yet not a perfect answer. What do you people think?
