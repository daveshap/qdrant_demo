BOBBY: All over. Chicago, Houston, Detroit. Just lately Dallas.
GRACE: You've been around.
BOBBY: I guess I've got wander in my blood.
GRACE: Where you headed?
BOBBY: I don't know. I have to make a stop in Vegas. Business to finish. Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara. I might be able to pick up some action there.
GRACE: So, what is it you do, Mister...?
BOBBY: Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
GRACE: I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.
BOBBY: If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
GRACE: What happens when you lose?
BOBBY: I pack up and go somewhere else.
