What structural reforms decrease partisanship / polarization?
I'm curious what would most help the US decrease toxic partisanship. Toxic partisanship is hard to quantify, but [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/opinion/hate-politics.html) best articulates what I mean. Some troubling statistics:

* Just over [42 percent](https://www.dannyhayes.org/uploads/6/9/8/5/69858539/kalmoe___mason_ncapsa_2019_-_lethal_partisanship_-_final_lmedit.pdf) of the people in each party view the opposition as “downright evil.”
* Some 20 percent of Democrats and 16 percent of Republicans [do think](https://www.dannyhayes.org/uploads/6/9/8/5/69858539/kalmoe___mason_ncapsa_2019_-_lethal_partisanship_-_final_lmedit.pdf) on occasion that the country would be better off if large numbers of the opposition died.
* [Only 14% of Americans](https://www.people-press.org/2019/04/11/public-trust-in-government-1958-2019/) today say they can trust the government in Washington to do what is right “most of the time”.

What structural reforms passed at the state / local level or in other countries have helped create an environment that incentivizes positive campaigning, working across the aisle, respectful rhetoric and focus on common ground?
