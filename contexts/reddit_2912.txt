Does my degree define the rest of my life?
I'm 21, have 2 years of university left to do, about to pursue a useless degree... but I don't really know what I want to do. No matter how much I try to explain it in short, it sounds pathetic. So here's my long explanation:

-Not knowing what I wanted to do, I was just going with the flow - went to business school straight out of high school, got depressed and was only able to do one semester (though I did well in the classes).

-I then applied to a different uni the following year to pursue Education. I do enjoy working with children but to be honest, I only did this to have a sense of security (a clear-cut career path) but all I had in mind was to eventually move out and teach English in Asia (SK or JP). You don't even need a teaching degree for that. Why I want to try living in a different country is, I constantly feel suffocated in my city and feel like there is so much more out there I could be doing. Anyway, I enjoyed taking my foundational/elective courses until junior year (this year) came and was constantly stick to my stomach at the thought of being a teacher here at home. I kept trying to convince myself to stay but I really didn't like what I was learning anymore and I was already dreading the thought of having to do practicums throughout my last 4 semesters. Being a teacher here (was an early childhood major too) was obviously going to be different than teaching only ESL. Eventually, I had to withdraw from my classes as I was having major depressive symptoms again, 10x worse than when I went to business school.

-I'm now taking the semester off to rest and work on my mental health but hoping to go back for a BA in Sociology in January. The motivation behind this is that: 1) all the classes I've done will not go to waste/will get credited 2) I've taken many classes on it and have always found the field enjoyable and interesting, but initially could never choose it as my major as I was worried about my job prospects here at home (STEM, healthcare, business, or die), and 3) really just out of obligation to finish the last 2 years of what I've already started. But then again, I'm in this constant loop of not knowing what career path I want to pursue <-> being afraid to pursue a major I enjoy but not knowing where it can get me long term. I'm still planning to teach English in SK for a few years because you can do that with any degree, but that's obviously not a long term career plan.

-These days I wake up with morning anxiety and I either gradually start feeling better throughout the day, or it just stays with me the entire day, my heartbeat constantly faster than normal. I feel like my anxiety is to the point where it is excessive - sometimes I would just feel empty and have no hope for the future. It doesn't help that I keep pitying myself and even wish I could just disappear and stop being a burden to my family (probably a huge motivation as to why I want to move to a whole different country). My family isn't the type to pressure me to do what they want, they just want me to finish something in school whatever it may be. Being Asian there's also no pressure with moving out ASAP or see anything wrong with being, say, 30 and still living with parents, that's a very western way of thinking I've realized.

-I would also like to mention that while I don't know what traditional career path I want to pursue, I have side hobbies that I've been doing since my first year of college. I am a YouTube content creator and thankfully, it hasn't exactly flopped and to this day I continue to make videos almost every week. I've started making money off of this but definitely not enough to become a career (at least not yet).

Ahh I don't know where I'm going with this anymore. I guess I'm trying to seek reassurance that everything will fall into place or that I can always go back to school (pursue grad school which is usually ideal for BA holders, get a certificate on something I like if I do find what that is, etc.) when I come back from teaching abroad (if I will even be back), or seek a professional's help because maybe my issue is more than just feeling lost in life but also a mental health issue idk. As I'm only 21, I know I have all the time in the world but many people my age are already achieving more than I do - there I go again with comparing myself to others. :(

Reddit is a place where there are people from all sorts of age groups so I would very much appreciate insight from a variety of you - people with experience, people who have changed careers, graduated and are not even doing something remotely related to their major, went back to school for a certificate in something completely unrelated, only found out their "calling" in life at 40, etc.

Edit: I think it would be best for me to take advantage of my financial dependence now and go back to business school instead of “just getting the BA and figuring things out later”. I’m starting to realize that one of the major contributors to my everyday anxiety is the fact that if I do pursue Sociology, I’m highly uncertain it won’t set me up for a career or at least a job that will enable me to live a financially independent and comfortable life. 

I’ve said this in the replies below but my passion in content creating on Youtube and having worked with brands have sparked interest in business and marketing that I never had when I went to business school straight out of high school. Through this, I am starting to find my intended career path and I’m willing to take small steps to get a clearer sense of it. The fact that whenever I look at possible jobs/careers/college programs I always lean towards business is telling. 

Trivial, but I’ll be more confident at least to tell people I’m in school for a BBA to become xyz compared to trying to explain why I’m in school for a BA in Sociology.
