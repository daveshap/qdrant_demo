ELLIS: John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
MCCLANE: Ellis, what have you told them?
ELLIS: I told them we're old friends and you were my guest at the party.
MCCLANE: Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
ELLIS: Tell me about it.
