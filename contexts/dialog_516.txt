SANDRO: Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
PATRIZIA: I don't see why I should mind.
CLAUDIA: I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
SANDRO: Yes, maybe that is better.
PATRIZIA: What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
CLAUDIA: Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
