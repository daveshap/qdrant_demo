Do any of you regret your major? where are you now? (majored in finance (class of 2020), thinking of going back to school right away)
Hmm well yeah I majored in finance and I even did a high finance internship and it was very tedious and boring. While the money was good, there was no freedom working in that kind of environment, and it felt like my life had no meaning. It was really quite sad. Im not 2 weeks away from graduating and I thought I had a job lined up but theres been a hiring freeze, so now im toying with the idea of getting another degree with better work/life balance, and more prospects?

Im thinking of doing an accelerated program in either nursing or computer science. Nursing has jobs outside of the city and you can work flexible hours from what I know which is cool, compensation also isnt bad. Comp sci would likely augment my finance degree well and give me some cool options. 

Im 22 if that matters and Canadian
