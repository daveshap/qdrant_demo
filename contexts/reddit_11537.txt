My boyfriend just broke up with me
I didn't think it'd hurt this much. 

Update: Hey thanks guys I really appreciate all the words and suggestions. I'll give a little bit of details. I'm 20 we were going out for a couple months and this was my first real relationship. I was really starting to like the guy. I've been very upset about the whole thing because I'm so new to this. He said that he realized we didn't have as much in common as he originally thought... :/
