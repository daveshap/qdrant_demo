Predicting decay time of a resonant bandpass filter? In a typical resonant bandpass filter, resonance is set as none at 0 and full at 1, such that the filter rings infinitely at 1 and not at all at 0.If there is a two-pole resonant bandpass filter, with an impulse excitation to a maximum amplitude of \"1\" and resonance setting between 0 and 1:What is the mathematical equation that would allow you to predict the decay time of the resonant filter based on its resonance setting? For example, to an arbitrary level of \"1/e\"? ie. To 36.7879% its original amplitude?Thanks.Update June 3, 2018 @ 5:17 PMThanks to some good answers below, I now better understand the problem as follows:I need an equation to solve for Q or \u03b6 of the filter based on an input of time (where that time represents seconds to reach 1/e amplitude relative to a starting 1 amplitude).The bandpass filter will only be needed in an \"underdamped\" condition, ie. Q>0.5.Thanks again. This has been very informative and I think this should be a clearer and more answerable question.
