CLUETT: I haven't got it.
DUDE: Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.

DUDE: That don't do us any good.
CLUETT: But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
DUDE: We can take blood from anything — If it's comin' to us.
