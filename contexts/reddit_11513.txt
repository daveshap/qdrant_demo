My mom almost died over the weekend
My mom has been an alcoholic for 5+ years and she started drinking heavily on Thanksgiving. This past weekend she has been passed out and unresponsive. I had to leave the house, and when I got back, I found her car and a squad car parked in front of my house...
She had driven somewhere, and passed out as she was parking with 6x the legal limit of alcohol in her system. She almost died and was taken away in an ambulance. 
If she dies, I may go into the custody of my abusive father whom I am terrified of. 
I have no clue how to handle this or how to feel.
