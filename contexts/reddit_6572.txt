I’m contracted to 7 hours a week at work, am I allowed to say I can’t do a shift when I’ve been put down to do 4?
I’m a student in the UK and am contracted to 7 hours a week, however because it’s summer I’ve got 4 shifts a week (even though I said I’d do the odd fourth one and would prefer to do just 3.) My mom said I can say I can’t do a certain shift when I first see my rota because I’m only contracted to 7 hours a week. Is this true?
