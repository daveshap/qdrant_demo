Does Nautilus remote mounting use SSHFS? Does Nautilus' (Ubuntu 16.x or 17.x) remote file system mounting using SSHFS or something else?Note to Moderators: For keyword purposes, I've tagged this with \"Files\" because, although the application being discussed is technically called Nautilus, this is not stated basically anywhere in the Ubuntu GUI - it's always referred to as \"Files\" instead. So, newbies like myself searched using that keyword.
