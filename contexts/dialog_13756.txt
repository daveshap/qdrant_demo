AL: The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
JOE: Dieter!
AL: GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.

JOE: ...across THE BORDER. Come on!
RENE: That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
JOE: You've been there?
RENE: I know the territory.
JOE: You coming along?
AL: I'm against it.
RENE: I insist.
JOE: So do I.
RENE: This going to work?
JOE: Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
