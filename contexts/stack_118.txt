Using Swedish keyboard as English ANSI on macbook pro I have got a macbook pro late 2015 with MacOS High Sierra on it. It has a Swedish keyboard.How can I use it as an English ANSI type? There are problems with replacement some keys and it doesn't comfortable for my work. MacOS recognizes this keyboard as ISO and it is impossible to change it in system preferences.How can I fix this problem?
