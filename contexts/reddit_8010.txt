Applying for a MS while married and with a 7 months old boy
Hello, right now I am in an entry level position in the medical device industry. I get next to nothing and it would take me a long time like 5+ years for me to be a salaried employee (associate scientist and above) in my line of work. Going to grad school would make sense for me to be able to advance in the future. 
I have a BS in biochemistry. 
Iâ€™m interested in grad school but my question is how do people pay for life expenses while married with a baby and no job since grad school is essentially their job until they finish. 
Thank you in advance.
