ELLIE: Do you mind putting out the light?
PETER: Not at all.
PETER: Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho? It's tough enough as it is.
ELLIE'S VOICE: Oh, excuse me.
ELLIE'S VOICE: Oh, by the wayâ€”what's your name?
PETER: What's that?
ELLIE: Who are you?
PETER: Who, me? Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
ELLIE: You've got a name, haven't you?
PETER: Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
ELLIE: Peter Warne? I don't like it.
PETER: Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
ELLIE: Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
PETER: The pleasure is all mine.
PETER: I've been thinking about you.
ELLIE'S VOICE: Yes?
PETER: You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
PETER'S VOICE: I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
ELLIE: Goodnight, Mr. Warne.
