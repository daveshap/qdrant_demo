90s B-rated horror movie with a haunted house I remember watching a movie when I was around 6-8 (1990 - 1992) in Brazil, what makes the film has benn released probably around 3 years before at least.In this movie there was this house that was haunted by some kind of witch/spirit/demon or something. I remember the title in portuguese having the word \"bruxa\" (wicth in Portuguese), so I will call this thing witch.I remember a few scenes of this movie:A family moves to this house and the house was next to a cliff with the sea on the cliff.There was a man wearing a crucifix and he was proud of his \"protection.\" After being captured he is crucified and then fired at the cross.There was an old woman, who was tied to a chair and had her lips pierced by two people who looked like cavemen by their clothes and hair. Then she was burned in the fireplace.There was girl called Jane around her 16's or 18's who gives a little boy called Tommy (that was maybe her sibling or cousin) a toy recorder as a gift.In this scene the Jane demonstrates to Tommy how the toy works and she records the phrase: \"Jane loves Tommy\".After she leaves, Tommy records several times the phrase: \"I love you Jane\".In the end of the movie, the above mentioned recording is what defeats the witch, in a scene wherethe witch attacks Tommy and he drops the voice recorder, wich makes it starts playing the \"I love you Jane\" phraserepeatedly. This makes the witch insane and she suicides jumping through a window in the house and falling on the cliff.
