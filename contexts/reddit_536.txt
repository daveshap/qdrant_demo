I am longing for a bf
I'm 15 but I'm really mature for my age. When I say a bf I wouldn't date anyone who I couldn't imagine marrying. However I would never be allowed to date in a million years and I don't exactly live somewhere booming with eligible bachelors. I wouldn't be allowed to date anyway, well I have never been told but u know when u can just tell. I'mnnot allowed to go out to discos or what not tho frankly they r just orgies so I don't really have any way of meeting anyone because I also go to an all girls' school.
