Do buried corpses rot normally? I've been looking around a bit but I haven't found the answer. I'm curious as to whether buried corpses decay normally.Does a roof over the grave impact the decay, or do they decay as normal corpses?If I build a freezer around dirt graves or sarcophagi, will it keep them fresh? That way I could dig them up if things get bad, or if I really need a new cowboy hat!
