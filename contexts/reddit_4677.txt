Depression has gotten pretty bad.
Hi, so in these last months my world has been flipped upside down with the COVID19 messing with everything. Due to this I have had to move home into my verbally abusive household and finish my college program online. On top of this I am working a cashier job I hate, and I am left alone with my thoughts everyday I come home from work. My friends haven't contacted me in a few months and I'm always the one reaching out to them, and my partner is very distant.
I haven't felt this alone in a while. 
All in all everything keeps going wrong, one thing after the other. And I am tired of it. My suicidal thoughts have become evermore present this past month, and I'm requesting support because I just don't know how to feel okay anymore. 
I don't expect to be happy all the time, but I can't even remember the last time I felt happy. 
I just don't know what to do anymore. Thank you for reading.
