ALTHEA: What do they want from me? What have I done that's so wrong? They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something... Even you probably have things.
MUMFORD: Me more than most.
ALTHEA: Why are they ganging up against me?
MUMFORD: I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
ALTHEA: It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous. I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
MUMFORD: How did they threaten you?
ALTHEA: They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more. What do you think about that?
MUMFORD: Good kids.
ALTHEA: Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
MUMFORD: Hmm?
ALTHEA: I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
MUMFORD: Really? You think so?
ALTHEA: Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
MUMFORD: How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
LILY: Doc. Ainge...
COOK: Dr. Mumford.
MUMFORD: Mr. Cook.
COOK: Could you come with me please?
COOK: I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
MUMFORD: Uh-huh.
COOK: It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
MUMFORD: What's that?
COOK: We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it -- -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
MUMFORD: Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
COOK: That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
MUMFORD: No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
COOK: Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads. It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
MUMFORD: Why's that?
COOK: Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
MUMFORD: Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
COOK: I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
MUMFORD: Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
MUMFORD: Hello, Lionel.
LIONEL: You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
MUMFORD: You're right, as usual. See you.
