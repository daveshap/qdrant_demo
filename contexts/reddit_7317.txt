Being trained... but looking at leaving
So I need to know if I'm being a bit of a dick to my company, I am currently looking for a new job closer to home to half my commute and lower my costs, but my current company is spending money on getting me certified on forklifts.

I cant say to my boss that I'm looking for a new job or else I'll just get it owed for everything but at the same time I'm costing them money for this training and I might get a new job within a month.
