iPhone: Block One Website & Only One Website I need a way to block one website on my iPhone while leaving \"adult content\" available.I'm very familiar with the block adult content restriction on the iPhone, but the amount of sites this feature blocks is ridiculous. It blocks anything that mentions men's/women's health and even websites crucial to my university's student life. (And no, I can't just white-list them because they all have different domain trees &amp; it blocks the brief login page that occurs before I complete said login).I've also looked at apps such as Zero Willpower, but these seem to only work with safari. (I use chrome).Is there any way to allow access to all websites and only block one? (Perhaps a way to white-list all websites under the \"adult content\" banner and then blacklist the target site).
