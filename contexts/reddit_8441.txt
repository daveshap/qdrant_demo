San Francisco is proposing a **retroactive** tax on IPO-based personal income. Would such a tax be constitutional per the ex-post-facto provision of the Constitution?

Ex-post-facto laws are explicitly forbidden in [Article I Sec 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_10:_Limits_on_the_States):

> No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, **ex post facto Law**, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility
