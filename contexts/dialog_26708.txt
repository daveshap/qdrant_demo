MIKE: Cut that shit out.
TRENT: She smiled baby.
MIKE: That's not cool.
TRENT: Did she, or did she not smile?
MIKE: It doesn't matter...
TRENT: I'm telling you, they love that shit.
MIKE: You're gonna screw up our plan.
TRENT: We're gonna get laid, baby.
MIKE: First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
TRENT: What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
MIKE: Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
TRENT: Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
MIKE: The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
TRENT: Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
MIKE: That's where we make our scene.
TRENT: You think they're watching?
MIKE: Oh, they're watching all right. They're watching.
