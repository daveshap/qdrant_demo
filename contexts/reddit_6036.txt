I should feel lucky to have a job during COVID19, but the toxic environment at work is making my depression worse.
After being with the company for almost a year I realized I’m extremely depressed at work.

Employees have quit due to the clear favoritism and nepotism within our department. Other employees have been fired or laid off. In total 4 employees are gone which is half of our team. I’m expected to take on all of their work plus cover for other positions if they are out of office. My boss always seems to find a scapegoat who is constantly met with aggressive emails about their work performance. Non essential low level employees who have desk jobs are still expected to come in during stay at home orders.

I’ve expressed my concerns multiple times and was told to keep my head down. Everyday I wake up with my severe depression worsening because of my job. Im unable to take care of myself. What should I do? There’s hiring freezes almost everywhere resulting in me being too scared to quit.
