JEFF: Jefferies.
GUNNISON: Congratulations, Jeff.
JEFF: For what?
GUNNISON: For getting rid of that cast.
JEFF: Who said I was getting rid of it?
GUNNISON: This is Wednesday.
JEFF: Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
GUNNISON: Wrong day?
JEFF: Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
GUNNISON: That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
JEFF: Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
