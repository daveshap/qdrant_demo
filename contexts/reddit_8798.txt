Under a "no deal" Brexit, what specific UK and EU policies govern the treatment of the Irish border?
On March 27, 2017, the government of the UK [formally](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prime-ministers-letter-to-donald-tusk-triggering-article-50) invoked [Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty,](http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html) which provides that the treaties forming the European Union cease to apply as of 2 years from the invocation of the Article by a member state.

Accordingly, unless there is unanimous agreement of the European Council and the United Kingdom, those treaties will cease to be in force as of March 28, 2019.  This is being called a ["no deal" Brexit.](https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/05/no-deal-brexit-7288751/)

The May government has [proposed a white paper on what they would like to agree to with the EU,](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589191/The_United_Kingdoms_exit_from_and_partnership_with_the_EU_Web.pdf) however that is only one side of the negotiation, and [it may not be agreed to by the EU.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44816048)

In particular, I am curious about the Republic of Ireland / Norther Ireland Border.

The UK shares [a land border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_border) with the Republic of Ireland, which is an EU member.  

Under the Good Friday Agreement, the border has remained open with no checkpoints.  However, [parties including Ireland's Prime Minister](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/brexit-threatens-good-friday-agreement-irish-pm-warns) have said that Brexit could result in a hard border being enforced and violation of the agreement.

The UK government has apparently indicated [that they would not enforce a hard border in Ireland even in the event of no deal](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-northern-ireland-border-brexit-eu-hard-no-deal-cabinet-irish-a8235096.html) but this has not been stated officially.

What relevant laws govern the UK, Republic of Ireland, and EU behavior regarding the  border in the event of a 'no deal'?
