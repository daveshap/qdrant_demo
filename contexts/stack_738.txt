I deleted my network manager I was running few terminal commands and ran \"purge network-manager\" command. And as expected I deleted my network manager and I am unable to access the internet. I searched the internet for a solution and found that the \"network manager\" file can be downloaded from ubuntu website to another device and copy the file to ubuntu computer. Then we can run the \"dpkg -i\" command to install the network manager back. I tired to find the network manager file on the website but could not find it as I found many variants(versions) of it. Can somebody point me to the network manager file required for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS ? And it would be of great help if you can confirm that the procedure that I am trying is safe and sound.Thanking you in Advance.Edit: I am a new to ubuntu. Any kind of help is appreciated.
