Being someone’s rebound sucks. Don’t start dating if you’re not over your ex.
All I can say is this situation absolutely sucks. I (23yo) met this guy (24m). I wasn’t really looking to date but he was very persistent and I was bored one evening and so I agreed to go to dinner. He was amazing! We got on so well he really surprised me. We would text all day every day and we started seeing each other every other day roughtly. 
We’re in bed together and I’m almost asleep and he whispers that he loves me! (Im very sure he thought i was asleep and couldn’t hear me!) I was so gassed I thought maybe I’d finally found someone I want to be in a relationship with. 
Fast forward a month and we’re in bed together. Completely out of the blue he says he doesn’t want anything serious because he “is over his ex but not over the relationship”. She left him for someone else and the way he talked about her he go so defensive he’s clearly still in love with her!! 
I’m completely heart broken - I never had a chance with this guy. And what really pisses me off is I never even initiated anything!!! I wouldn’t have fell for him if he hadn’t come on so strong with me!!! 
Side note: anyone else think that when he whispered I love you to me he was pretending I was his ex cos I can’t stop thinking about it! 

Anyways I have become a crazy person because of this situation. Needed to rant. That actually feels loads better!!
