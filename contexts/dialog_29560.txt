EARL: This is one big mother!
VAL: So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
EARL: Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
VAL: Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them. We just didn't tell <u>you</u>. Come on, nobody's ever seen one of these! We're really <u>in</u> on something here!
EARL: Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
VAL: You got <u>that</u> right!
EARL: Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
VAL: Naw, don't want to winch it. That'd tear it all up. Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
