EVE: So where is your roommate, the model?
CLIFF: You know, I don't know. And looking at you, I don't care. It's been too long, Eve.
ADAM: Please excuse this interruption.
CLIFF: Oh, brother...
ADAM: Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
CLIFF: What?!
ADAM: I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair. Well, isn't he? And shallow, as well?
CLIFF: Shallow? I'm shallow?!
EVE: Go home, Adam. Go to your hotel.
CLIFF: Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
ADAM: Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
CLIFF: Do ya?
EVE: Stop it, you two!
CLIFF: I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
