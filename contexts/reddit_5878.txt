My manager scheduled me for hours I didnâ€™t sign up for
Im pretty sure I was being gaslit and definitely being pressured into taking up the hours. I dont know how to handle these situations in the future, i think I handled this instance well but I dont know for certain. Im not sure what other info I should put but Id be happy to answer questions
