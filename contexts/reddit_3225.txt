Has anyone recovered from a non linear career and wrong career choices?
I took decisions out of fear and accepted jobs that where sometimes lower sometimes better... I donâ€™t have a beautiful CV  (twice 1year stints - and mostly project management and national sales jobs) and I just realized that my next job is not what I thought it would be - and I am scared.

How did you guys recover? Start at the bottom again with 35?

Thank you
