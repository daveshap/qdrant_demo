AL: What was that?
JOE: Who was that? Somebody out there?
AL: You weren't listening!
JOE: Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head. Why don't I just take you back to UST?
AL: Why don't you?
AL: No they won't.
JOE: Why not?
AL: I'll talk to them.
JOE: Oh...Gooood!
AL: I'll tell you what to say.
JOE: If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
AL: If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
