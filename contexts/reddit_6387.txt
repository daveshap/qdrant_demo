Advice on Job Offers (x-post from r/Biology)
Hello! I was wondering if anyone would be able to give me advice on two job offers that were offered to me. First, I'd just like to give a little bit more info about myself.


I am a recent graduate as a biology student (B.S.). I have no previous lab or work experience since I focused majority of my time in school, so I am VERY excited and grateful to have any job offers at all. In the future, I hope to transition into more computer science / software engineering, or maybe even something like bioinformatics. Since I am thinking of going that route, I am also thinking about going back to school to either get a M.S. or another B.S. in CS or SE if I have to. But this is way in the future once I have enough money saved up!


So here are the two offers that were given to me as I looked for a job:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Offer 1**: Lab Assistant (8 hrs, 0.5 hr for lunch)
* $13.27/hr  – No clocking in or out, so it’s kind of like salary.
               -Flexible hours for when to start/leave, and flexible lunch break.
* Accrue PTO hours – 5 hours per paycheck (Every 2 weeks).
* HMO, vision, and dental. 
* 401K available, but no matching.


--Pros: 
* Flexible hours are nice. As long as I work about 40 hrs a week, no one seems to mind what my hours are.
* Not as strict with regards to workplace as long as I finish my work since I would be working with the rest of the lab techs only.
* I am fairly familiar and comfortable with the duties assigned to me.
* I can get great references for future jobs or for grad school (well-known as well as new Ph.Ds). 

-Cons: Quality Assurance for pharmaceutical (8 hrs, 0.5 hr for lunch)
* No overtime. And based on what other workers I have spoken to said, I will usually end up staying longer than 8 hrs per day (~8.5 hrs, sometimes maybe even 9).
* Less money
* Further from my apartment, (~30 minute drive).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Offer 2:** Quality Assurance in Pharmaceutical
* $14/hr for the 1st year as a start, annual performance review. 
* 1 wk vacation for first three years, 2 wks after three years, 3 wks after five years.
                -3 sick days per year.
* HMO, vision, and dental included after 30 days.
* 401K after 90 days +$250 annually for contributing to 401K.

--Pros:
* More money is always nice. With this, I make almost an extra $100+ a month, and almost $1000+ more annually.
* Overtime (1.5 hrs) for whenever I work after given hours.
* Closer to my apartment (>10 minutes away using side streets).
* Less wet-lab work.

Cons: 
* Most of the tasks that will be assigned to me are things I know little to nothing about.
* Stricter start/end and lunch times since I have to clock in and out. 
* I don't know if references for this job will be as useful as the other in the future. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So my questions are: 
1. Which job offer would be better to take?
2. Which job offer will be more beneficial financially?
3. Which job offer will be more beneficial in the future career-wise, or would help me reach my future goals better?

Thank you in advance to anyone that helps!
