I just wanna say something to you guys.
I’ve lurked on this sub for about 2 years now I think** (been on reddit for a long time and forget when I subbed on my first account.)And I always wished I could have a job to let me do what you guys did. Well, this past year and a half I got a decent job with good pay, paid off 11k of 17k debt, got a house (lower payment than rent) and a new (used) car. Oh and got engaged to my gf. You guys give me the incentive to save or pinch pennies instead of blowing money on nonsense. Everything I buy now is typically a sale or makes sense fiscally in the short to long run, and I’ve actually started building a savings. 
My credit went up 150 points from 4 years ago and I was just feeling great and honestly it’s a mindset change just from watching you all post and share your stories. 

Thanks. Have a great Tuesday.

Edited timing of me subbing as many have pointed out the sub hasn’t been around that long, just feels like forever.
