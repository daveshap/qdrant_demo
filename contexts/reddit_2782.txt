Does anyone have experience with never being satisfied with jobs?
Little bit of background. I'm 32 (M) and have been working for 4 years now. The first 3 years of my career I worked abroad. Just over a year ago I moved back home. I'm currently at my 5th employer after changing jobs a few time because of moving between cities but also because of a few very bad experiences where I didn't like/hated my job. I've worked at a wide variety of companies as a data analyst/market researcher, from scale-ups to some of the world's largest advisory firms. The pay has always been very good. Currently, I'm working at a bank.

Everywhere around me I see people being super engaged with the company/job. They appear to be what some call "passionate". The problem is that I've never been satisfied (or passionate) with any of the jobs I had. The first few months I'm super excited getting to know the company, the people, and learn the ropes. However, after a few months that feeling fades and I start to think about what to do next. 

This has resulted in things like casually looking on LinkedIn for jobs, getting hooked on the idea of starting my own business from home (e.g., dropshipping, starting a blog, and much more have passed) but never really going for it, focusing on hobbies hoping to make a living out of it and working om my technical skills (actually useful for my career).

It's not that I hate my job or that I wake up every day dreading going to work; it just not fulfills me to the same extent as it does for the "passionate" people. Maybe I get bored very easily, maybe I'm not in the right field of work, maybe I've just had bad luck with jobs, maybe I should change my mindset. I don't know!

I'm curious to find out if this sounds familiar to people. Are there any people who have experienced the same? And how did you overcome this?
