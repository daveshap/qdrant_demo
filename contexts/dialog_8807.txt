ARTHUR: At last...
KAY: Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
ARTHUR: ...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was... ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
MORDRED: Father...
ARTHUR: Rise, Mordred.
MORDRED: I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
ARTHUR: I recognize you only as my son, no more.
MORDRED: And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
MORDRED: The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
ARTHUR: Your mother told you that?
ARTHUR: I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
MORDRED: And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
