I'm so stressed and depressed. Application after application, rejection after reject. Time to give up?
I wish someone told me that a bachelors degree in biology was useless. I never would have majored in that subject. With $37K in debt, at age 30, should I just go back to school and major in another subject? Ive had 5 interview this year, all rejected. I have a folder of resumes Ive sent out in the past 3 years, total? 275. How many interviews? 13. What do I do?
