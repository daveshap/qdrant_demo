Can we talk about lifestyle creep?
This may be naive of me, but I really don't understand it when I read posts on other subreddits about people who are "barely getting by" on 50k+ per year. I understand that it depends on where one lives, financial emergencies, children, etc, but I'm having a hard time wrapping my mind around this mentality. I'm currently a graduate student living in the US making about $18k a year before taxes and I'm honestly more comfortable now than I was growing up and living with my parents. I may not have the nicest things, but I don't have to think too hard about going to a movie with friends every once in a while. If I need a new shirt for a conference or interview, I can afford it. I eat fresh fruit and vegetables every day when they're in season. I can even afford the occasional long weekend in the mountains if I plan ahead and ask for overtime to make up for it. Life is comfortable. If I made $50k a year, I imagine I wouldn't have many worries. Is lifestyle creep really that insidious to make people believe they're living in poverty when they're not?
