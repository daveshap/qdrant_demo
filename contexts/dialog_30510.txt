COX: Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
PARKER: You son—of—a—bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
MADISON: He didn't know about the neural toxin. I did.
PARKER: You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
COX: She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
PARKER: Then I guess we're even.
MADISON: How did you find out about the toxin?
PARKER: Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
MADISON: You're not capable of it.
PARKER: I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
MADISON: I was wrong. And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
