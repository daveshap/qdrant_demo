How do I become a funny and witty person?
Ever since this pandemic stuff started I haven’t been feeling the same, i used to make everyone laugh and make up my own jokes. Now I just feel dull and not the same. I’ve been depressed throughout the entire pandemic and I had really bad anxiety issues in the beginning weeks. 

Whenever I try to sound funny or use my wits it just sounds stupid it’s like it faded away. I’m no longer depressed or have anxiety, I’m just not feeling the vibe I was feeling when I was in school, it makes me feel demotivated. I rather opt to a better position and come back to my friend group fts and make it worth their otherwise I pretty much have nothing to talk or joke about. 

I haven’t really been watching any funny youtubers, comedians, or shows ever since (some recommendations might boost my mood)
What can I do to get myself back into my original position? any advice helps.
