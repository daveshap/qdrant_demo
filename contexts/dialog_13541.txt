CONSTANCE: And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
DAVID: Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
CONSTANCE: What do you want me to do?
DAVID: I want you to leave with us. Right now.
CONSTANCE: I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
DAVID: He's not going to listen to me.
MOISHE: Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
DAVID: Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
MOISHE: You punched the President in the face?
DAVID: He wasn't the President then.
CONSTANCE: David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
MOISHE: Punched the President? Oh my god.
