How does your institution deal with staffers on maternity leave?
I work in a student activities office at a small institution.  We are a two person office, and I'll be out for most of the spring semester on maternity leave.  Because of budget deficit, my boss just learned we will be unable to hire anyone to cover my role for my leave.  

Our office is not really manageable as a one-person operation [it's barely functional as is with two].  Any suggestions on what we should do?  The other staffer is also job searching, but I'm going to leave that wrench out of the works for now...
