RAY: One-two-three, swing.
JERRY: Thanks. May I offer you both a ride?
DOROTHY: Oh no. I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up. Thanks, though. Bye.
JERRY: Dorothy. Ray. A pleasure.
