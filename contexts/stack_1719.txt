Clock Domain Crossing While reading the concept of CLOCK DOMAIN CROSSING I came across the 2 flip-flop synchronizer. If my first flop goes into metastable state, then how will it detect the correct value of data when it will come out of the metastable state? If my input is '1' and after coming out of metastable state my flip flop detects it as '0' then won't it create a problem in circuit as it is propagating false output through the whole circuit?
