WILLCOX HILLYER: I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
DADDY: Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
WILLCOX HILLYER: Yeah, they're in the snow.
DADDY: Are they polar bears, too?
WILLCOX HILLYER: Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
DADDY: Got another twenty years in it, boy. By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
WILLCOX HILLYER: Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
DADDY: How could that be, son?
WILLCOX HILLYER: Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
