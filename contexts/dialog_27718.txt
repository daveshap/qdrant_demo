FETTES: You asked to see me, ma'am?
MRS. MARSH: I want you to help my little girl.
FETTES: I'm only a student.
MRS. MARSH: Georgina told me how kind you were to her. It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
FETTES: I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
MRS. MARSH: Did he tell you about Georgina?
FETTES: I didn't mean it that way. I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
MRS. MARSH: Ask this one favor --
FETTES: Of course I will.
