College students and prefrosh are NOT QUALIFIED to give admissions advice or offer paid essay review services
I'm sick of prefrosh here doing AMAs and acting like they're admissions experts when they have yet to take a single class at their universities. Worse, some are trying to make a quick buck off nervous juniors by offering paid essay review services.

Yes, I know they're fairly rare. But I'm seeing more and more of those slimy posts as the next app season approaches. (EDIT: When fall comes, there will probably be far more. Rising seniors, don't fall for it. Plenty of college students will review your essay for free)

By the way, college students doing these things are no better than the prefrosh. Does a college English class make you qualified to offer paid college essay review services? It's such a shocker for me that college English classes teach you about admissions practices. Are colleges trying to set us all up for high-paying careers in college consulting? Awesome!

Also, dear prefrosh, you don't know what got you accepted. I don't know if your T20 acceptances went right to your head and got you so excited that you forgot what humility is, but unless you're one of the lucky few with an AO who gave you a straight answer about what got you in, you don't know shit. Did your reader love your writing? Maybe she played the same niche sport as you, giving you that tiny bump in her mind that you needed to get in over that other kid with perfect stats.

Wait until you get your admissions file to talk about "what got you in," although in **some** cases, your admissions file might as well be written in hieroglyphics with how many different scores some schools assign each applicant, each score for an unknowable abbreviation like Stanford.

>"TSR, HSR, Sup, EC, SPIV, CAPE, MD, IVE, PE â€” everything is encoded in a mysterious admissions officer language. [https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/10/16/i-looked-at-my-admissions-file-heres-what-i-saw/](https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/10/16/i-looked-at-my-admissions-file-heres-what-i-saw/)

Anyway, **college students and prefrosh are not qualified to talk about admissions like they know anything,** unless they're quoting a current or former admissions officer or a (legitimate) college counselor or applying advice from such a qualified individual. Sharing your own story is cool. Telling others that this or that is what got you in is not.

I can't tell if it's willful blindness or just a general lack of balls, but people on this sub go on and on about injustice and inequality but rarely bother to take 10 seconds to post a comment calling out prefrosh on bullshit and report unqualified essay reviewers to the mods. In this sub's eyes, it's cool to rag on CollegeBoard for money-grubbing but fine turn a blind eye to prefrosh "sharing their opinions" on what matters in college admissions and take money from nervous juniors for a service many of the kind college students on A2C will do for free.

Randoms on A2C ripping off kids clearly isn't as big as CollegeBoard shooting a salvo of fees at us, but the former is something you have far, far more control over. Downvote, comment, report to mods. This sub is too fucking tolerant of bullshit from its own members.

Edit 1: For clarification, college student AMAs are often helpful. They can provide valuable information about their schools' students, culture, and so on. The AMAs veer toward uselessness and misinformation when they walk the path of admissions speculation. I don't mean factual discussion about their ECs, essays, etc. I mean true speculation on how this or that extracurricular was the best one, or that their essay was everything. He/she should not be making those statements before reading his/her admissions file (assuming their university isn't one whose admit files say nothing meaningful).

I should also clarify is that prefrosh can be very helpful with, as u/tripsledge states below, the application process. There are countless low-level details like how often prompts change, whether a school requires official score sends, and so on. Prefrosh can answer those basic questions well. But again, they don't know what got them accepted and shouldn't pretend to.

Edit 2: Most of the commenters obviously didn't even read the post, so here's a

**TL;DR:**

(1) College students & prefrosh should not charge students for essay review. That is unethical for reasons outlined above. Furthermore, the fact that you *can* do something does not mean it's ethical to do it.

(2) College students & prefrosh shouldn't act like they're admissions experts. Speculation on a complicated and often random process like admissions is not useful. Hard facts are great. Sharing your own story is great. Info about schools from college students is great.

(3) This is not a rag on all college student AMAs. Me saying *"college students aren't qualified to speak authoritatively about admissions"* somehow got interpreted as me saying *"all college discussion bad bad bad"*
