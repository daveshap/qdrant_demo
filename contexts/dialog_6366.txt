LIZA: People do have heart attacks.
JERRY: Sure. You switched the charts, didn't you?
JERRY: It's okay. The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store. He had it coming.
LIZA: You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night. Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
JERRY: You switched the charts; you tell me.
LIZA: I got to get downstairs. The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
JERRY: Really?
JERRY: I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch. And thanks.
LIZA: For what?
JERRY: You saved my life.
LIZA: <u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
