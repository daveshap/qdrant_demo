PINKERTON: We're moving you tomorrow.
JESSE: But I like the presidential suite.
PINKERTON: Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
JESSE: So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
PINKERTON: That's the idea.
JESSE: Did you order our houses burned down?
PINKERTON: Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
