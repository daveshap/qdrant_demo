These stretch marks are bothering me.
I've had all sorts of scars since about 12, and I've just now (few months) noticed them. I know some will disappear in a few years, but they ARE everywhere, under my funny bone, near my underarm, lower abdomen, crotch, and knees. Does anyone know any cheap, but really effective treatments for this that will usually work?
