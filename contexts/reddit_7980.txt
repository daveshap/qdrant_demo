When did your PI tell you if you’re getting a stipend or not?
I’ve just been accepted into the grad program I want to attend. I’ve known my PI for a while and have done research from them. I don’t just want to straight up ask if I’m getting a stipend or not but I want to start thinking how I will finance everything because I have to move out of my parents house. My school hasn’t released financial aid information for fall 2020 yet. When does a PI usually let their student know?
