SHERMIN: This has always been my favorite time of day.
MAJOR BELL: Very beautiful country up here...
SHERMIN: Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
MAJOR BELL: Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
SHERMIN: Can you see under the faceplate?
MAJOR BELL: No.
SHERMIN: There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
MAJOR BELL: Wait'll you see it.
MAJOR BELL: We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
SHERMIN: Was there visual contact?
MAJOR BELL: No, sir. Radar.
SHERMIN: It could have been anything.
MAJOR BELL: After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
SHERMIN: People have made mistakes in these situations before.
MAJOR BELL: I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
