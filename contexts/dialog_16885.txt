MALCOLM: I'm in Detroit.
BETTY: I know.
MALCOLM: At a gas station. Will you marry me?
BETTY: Yes.
MALCOLM: Did you hear what I said?
BETTY: Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
MALCOLM: I think so. Can you catch a plane?
BETTY: Yes. Did you eat?
MALCOLM: I love you.
MALCOLM: It won't be easy.
BETTY: Just hold me.
MALCOLM: It will be rough.
BETTY: Hush your mouth.
MALCOLM: I'll be away a lot.
BETTY: You're with me even when you're away.
BETTY: I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
MALCOLM: What do you think?
BETTY: The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
