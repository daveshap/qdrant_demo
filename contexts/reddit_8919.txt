How do different countries balance military order with due process rights of soldiers accused of misconduct?
Today in [a major ruling,](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/17891/index.do) the Supreme Court of Canada rejected 5-2 a challenge to the country's military justice system for failing to provide jury trials to soldiers accused of serious crimes in Canada.^1

I want to use this as a springboard to understand better how military justice and civilian justice interplay in different countries.

In particular:

* What schemes have been developed in different countries for dealing with ordinary or off-duty crimes by members of the military when stationed in their home country?

* What systems have been developed, or problems arisen, related to soldiers stationed outside their home countries who commit ordinary crimes?

* What protections of due process are generally found in military courts, versus what protections are forfeit?
