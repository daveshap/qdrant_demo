COTTER: How'd you know they were--
DOMINI: --hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
COTTER: My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
DOMINI: No.
NICK: Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
COTTER: Spite.
NICK: They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
DOMINI: I don't think it was them.
COTTER: Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
DOMINI: I don't know yet.
COTTER: Well, please keep me fucking informed!
