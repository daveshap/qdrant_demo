my first startup job!
i recently began working at what, after doing some research, i've identified is a startup that is probably in it's last 6 to 9 months of life. there are no breaks or lunch on my shift and overtime is absolutely expected, but unpaid. this is a bit of a shock coming from the hourly world. trying to adjust, and also trying to find places who might be able to interview on weekends because i can see the culture is already taking a toll on my mental health and i feel stuck.

have you worked in a startup? what are your experiences?
