INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
RASCZAK: I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
RASCZAK: Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
RASCZAK: My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER: Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
