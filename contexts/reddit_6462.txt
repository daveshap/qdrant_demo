I'd receiving pizza at work a red flag now?
I haven't had a job in a year, but is this a new trend?...

At my new job, my boss's boss bought pizza when the HR person came in. However, she came in and demoted my boss to part time. I think it was because they have cancer and chemotherapy is expensive... So they didn't want to pay for their treatment anymore.

Then, just a few weeks ago, another group in my company got pizza from their boss's boss. It turns out the department is being let go, because they no longer need them... 2/2 times within this new company... It seems getting a pizza lunch is followed up by grim news... But hey, at least we had some pizza for lunch...
