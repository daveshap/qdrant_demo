Please dont AGREE on a date if you're clearly not interested
Happened to me (F, 20s) a couple of times this month. In both ocassions, the guys agreed to the date, even sounded excited about it, showed up, and when they did they acted like they had zero interest and were forced to be there against their will.

This is stupid and a waste of everyone's time. If someone asks you on a date and you don't think you'd be into the person, just say so! "hey you are a cool person but I just don't see that way" is a much better strategy than "I'ma show up and act fully uninterested the whole time so she gets the point."

It's okay to say no from the get go. Please don't say "yes" just to be polite.

EDIT 1: Since a lot of people are asking this, I met both of these guys in real life not dating apps so there were no "they didn't look like their photo" surprises.

EDIT 2: I met both of these guys in 2 different weekend-long camping trips. So we had spend a considerable amount of time talking in a group setting. aka they had at least gauged my personality.

EDIT 3: A surprising amount of "did they know your body type?" comments. [Here's a pic from before my run this morning.](https://imgur.com/gallery/SjkdXlZ) Disclosure: all 3 people discussed in this post are huge gym rats. One of the dates took place at a gym.
