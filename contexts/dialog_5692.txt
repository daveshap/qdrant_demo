JODY: Wait.
MARGE: What?
JODY: I'm not leaving. I want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. Three of my classmates are dead.
MARGE: Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
JODY: Attacked how?
MARGE: She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
JODY: You didn't believe her?
MARGE: No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
JODY: Why not?
MARGE: They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
JODY: People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
MARGE: They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
JODY: And the police did nothing?
MARGE: EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
JODY: How could you?
MARGE: I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
JODY: The word is Mob.
MARGE: I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
JODY: Who were they?
MARGE: Who?
JODY: The men. Do any of them still live around here?
MARGE: Two men left town right after it happened.
JODY: You're not telling me something.
MARGE: Mr. Sisler was one of them.
JODY: The principal?
MARGE: Yes.
JODY: Who was the fourth?
