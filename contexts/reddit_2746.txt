A former employee of mine is represented herself on her resume using my title and not the title she had. Should I let her current employer know this or let it slide?
While researching a company I was interviewing with, I discovered that one of my former employees was working there. In her mini bio on the company’s website, it lists job responsibilities for her past job that were actually my responsibilities. When I checked her LinkedIn profile, she lists her job title for the period she worked for me as my title. This led me to wonder if she had misrepresented herself to obtain her current position.

I’m wondering what to do about it. Should I let her employer know about it? I would want to know were I the person who hired her as I would not want someone on my team who misrepresented her credentials to get the job. On the other hand, I’m sympathetic because had she used her own title in her profile, it would list several titles of “manager” followed by “coordinator,” which looks like a step backward. 

I’m leaning toward ignoring it.
