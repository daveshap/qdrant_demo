What does it means to do ok or mediocre?
People with good performance can make requests and get more benefit like pay increase but for those who don't they won't get fired but they will just be status quo and of course bad performance will be fired. So I am thinking when they mean do ok what does it cover and not cover? When a task is given we are literally fighting a war and losing this war means real life damage unlike school where only the simulation is damage and teacher can give and take freely. So if I consider this aspect aren't everyone suppose to win the war rain or shine and losing is not an option? If yes then what is a person who do ok but not good? Do they win or lose?
