I want to quit my job for a temp summer job, but I’m a student and we’re in a pandemic
I’m a physics student and support myself financially. I have an opportunity to do some awesome research this summer and get paid for it. I really want to do it, but here’s the thing: it’s temporary, and I’d have to quit my current job where I make 3 times as much money. The pay cut isn’t a huge deal to me because I have a good pile of savings, I kind of hate my current job anyway, and I feel that the new experience will be much more valuable for my future because I want to work in science. I’m just so worried I won’t have a job after the summer. I have secured an on campus job that pays relatively well for fall, but they said they won’t know whether funding will be cancelled until July. I guess I just wanted to vent.
