When to start a PhD or an EdD?
I finished my master’s in 2017, and I’m currently in my 3rd year of working in student affairs. Recently, I have been thinking about going back to school to start a PhD or an EdD, but I’m not sure if I’m starting too early or when would be a good time to start. Does anyone have any advice?
