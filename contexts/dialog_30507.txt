PARKER: You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
SID 6.7: Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
PARKER: GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
SID 6.7: I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
PARKER: DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
SID 6.7: You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
