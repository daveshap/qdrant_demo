WIGAND: Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all. You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry. So, what were you calling about?
LOWELL'S VOICE: You called me.
WIGAND: No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
LOWELL: Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
WIGAND: ...okay.
LOWELL: Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
WIGAND: How'd you know that, Lowell?
LOWELL: It's obvious, isn't it?
LOWELL: Hello. You there
WIGAND: Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
LOWELL: It's okay.
