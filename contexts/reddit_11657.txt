I want to quit my job. But I have no idea what to do next.
I am a 26 year old male who has been working in security for almost 2 years. When I first started it was interesting. But now I am thinking of wanting to do something else. My current job as a security guard is I escort people to their case worker and escort them when they are done. However, half of their department has moved to a new location. Now I usually don't get a new client once every 2 weeks. 95% of the time I just sit up there doing nothing. I often don't feel like I am achieving anything. I also don't like getting up really early in the morning to go to work. Then taking a bus an hour each way. I have been interested in getting a new job. However, the problem is I don't know what I am good at. I don't have that many skills that are top notch or my skills are scattered all over the place. I like playing video games, photography, cooking, science fiction, fantasy, history, and other geeky interest. I have been interested in working remotely from home but I am not so sure what jobs I want to do. I want to do something related to my interests but I got no clue.
