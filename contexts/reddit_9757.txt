A.M.A.: Laura Pasquini - June 9, 2014 (a.k.a. @laurapasquini on Twitter)
Hello #StudentAffairs and #SAChat friends. I'm a “soon-to-be-dissertation-defended” doctoral researcher studying Applied Technology and Performance Improvement at the College of Information. My day job is currently an Academic Counselor formerly with the Office for Exploring Majors, and now College of Business (again). I JUST accepted a faculty appointment for Fall 2014 with the @UNTCOI as a Lecturer with the department of Learning Technologies, and much of their interest in me is due to my professional experience with my administrative experience in higher ed. I'm addicted to good coffee, creative design projects, travel adventures, interesting debates, and general shenanigans. 

My not-so-typical career path in Student Affairs and Higher Education spans a few different countries (Canada, US, UK & France) and a variety of student support units, such as academic advising, career exploration, residence life, orientation, instruction, and faculty/staff development. When nerding it up with research, I assess and publish about learning, teaching, organizational culture, learning networks, and communities of practice. 

You'll find me curating “good stuff” on Twitter or blogging about my happenings here: http://techknowtools.wordpress.com/

Let’s get crazy. I’m an open book. What more do you want to know? Ask away.
