EDWARD: I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
OLIVER: That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling. You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
EDWARD: Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
AMY: I wasn't singing to myself.
EDWARD: Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
