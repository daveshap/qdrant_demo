Is it normal to feel this way about work?
I work in tech sales, specifically in a remote working solution. This is my first job since leaving uni and my first full time job. There are lots of positives such as progression and a lot of autonomy. But I don’t like working in tech and I find sales to be very stressful. I lie awake at night thinking about having to work the next day. I am a grown 23 year old man and it makes me want to cry. 

This may sound ridiculous but I don’t know if this is an issue with the role or just a problem with me.

I am looking into other roles but I have a fear that I will feel the same in that role and I could end up in a worse situation. I don’t really know what to do.
