What do we think about staffing agencies ?
 My job laid me off (I have the most experience in health care admin) bc the doctor was writing too many scripts . 

So I went to a staffing agency , and they have been disorganized , flakey , and have lied  to me about the jobs , the location of the job and the pay . 

They got me in there by saying they had something “perfect” for me and they could match me at 14.50$ hour ,

Now , their “clients “ can’t match my rate and they want me to basically start telemarketing at 8am to 5pm in their office as a “junior recruiter “ 

Monday and Friday they texted me last minute saying that the boss was in a meeting and I only needed to come in at 12 . 

Today I slept past my alarm bc we lost electricity last night . I have to be honest I don’t feel so bad bc they haven’t been consistent . 

My friend went to a different agency and she said she got the similar run around . They didn’t have the jobs they said in the interview. But they could use her “internally” 

One thing I thought was weird during my time there was how my “boss” said she had to always beg people to come to work . But the handbook basically says if you leave voluntarily , you can’t get unemployment . 

Has anyone used a staffing agency before ? Which one did you have luck with?
