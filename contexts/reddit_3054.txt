Been teaching myself to code, need a job but probably not quite skilled enough yet to be hired as a developer. What should I do?
I've been teaching myself various coding skills like javascript, CSS, react etc.  I don't think I'm quite at the point yet where I could make it as a developer, but I have a strong foundation.  I really need a job, and while I could just go get any old job I'm worried that if I'm not doing something coding related I'll loose the skills I've worked so hard to develop.  I'm kind of in this limbo zone where I'm not good enough to be a fully fledged developer, but can't afford to do anything non coding related for aforementioned reasons.  Some people have suggested a development internship, but all of the listings I've found for those are for people currently working towards a CS degree, which I'm not.  What should I do? I'm desperately in need of income and I just feel confused and stuck.
