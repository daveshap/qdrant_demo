Would structural colouring work for making hair green, blue and or grey? Today I was thinking about how to make an elf who naturally grows blue hair. Thinking about this I came up with the idea of coloring the hair using microscopic eyes like with blue, green and gray eyes for normal people. I am wondering what would be required for this to work and what would be required to make darker shades, and the color purple, in elven hair. Now the fact that they are elves isn't very important; their biology is actually fairly similar except for in some places, so you can pretend their basically human for now.
