Blocked out of the blue
I was recently talking to this guy I had met. The conversation was going really well, we had a lot in common and had made plans to get together within the next few days. Then out of nowhere he blocked me on everything! We went from talking consistently to nothing in a matter of hours. 

Why oh why canâ€™t people just say when they are no longer interested instead of just leaving someone with more questions.
