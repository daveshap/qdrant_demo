I want to be a college admission officer but don't have degrees in education or mass communication
I have wanted to be many things, but one thing that has persisted in my heart is to be a college admission officer because having struggled with college admission due to little resources and financial difficulty myself, I want to be part of team that helps selecting well-deserved students to get opportunities they deserve. 

The thing is, I have a B.S. in chemical engineering and now working on Food Science master's with thesis. Y'all might think I am crazy or weird, but honestly at this point I am not sure what I want to do with my degrees lol...much less if I will get jobs with them at all because unlike my friends who have some Co-OP or internship experience, I have none(yeah being an international student sucks, but the good news is I will probably be a permanent resident soon!) 

Is it possible without education or communication major?
