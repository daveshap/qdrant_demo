Looking for Tips on surviving the 2nd shift with weekends.
As the title says, I'm currently seeking advice on how to survive my 2nd shift job that includes weekends. My shifts range from the times of 12-1:00 a.m. for eight to nine hours each day, and like I mentioned, weekends as well. 

While, in a post I put up before, I don't plan on sticking with the job for a *great* amount of time. (This is is due to a number of reasons, feel free to ask for details). I'm currently having a tiny bit of trouble keeping myself "pepped up" for going into work...

It's starting to become a struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance that doesn't keep my inside playing video games because everyone else is at work or asleep. When I am off on my so-called "weekends" at the start of the week they are unable to join me due to their work and own life. I *want* to go out and enjoy time with my friends and family, but I'm unable to. Believe it or not, it's starting to get to the point that my friends and family, for lack of a better way to put it, "forget" about me since I'm unable to interact with them. My phone has begun to go silent even though I'm putting in an effort to stay connected with everyone. 

Thus, I'm looking for tips or stories about people who have dealt with the same sort of thing. Any response is welcome and any story is also welcome in that same respect! 

*Feel free to ask for more details if you need to*
