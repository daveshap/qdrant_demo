ANNIE: Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
ROBERT: Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
ANNIE: Well, it's good that you're there.
ROBERT: So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
ANNIE: Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
ROBERT: When are you coming home?
ANNIE: You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
ROBERT: Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
ANNIE: Okay.
ROBERT: I miss you, Annie.
ANNIE: I know. We miss you too.
ROBERT: Good night.
ANNIE: Night.
GRACE: Did you ask him to come visit?
ANNIE: You already did.
GRACE: Did he mention it?
ANNIE: Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
