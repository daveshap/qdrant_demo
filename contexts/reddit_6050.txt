Returned check.
Returned check from job because bank account has been closed because of negative balance and because it was inactive. I was unable to work during the time it happened because of COVID. 

What should I ask my job? Will take a little bit of time? How long? 

I’ve never experienced this and I’m young so I don’t know what to do.
