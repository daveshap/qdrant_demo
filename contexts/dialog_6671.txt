AGENT HADLEY: This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
SOPHIE: Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
AGENT HADLEY: I can't bring the Bureau into this. If I do the tapes become evidence.
SOPHIE: They're supposed to be evidence. That's why Bastaldi set this up.
AGENT HADLEY: Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
SOPHIE: I thought you wanted Zammito?
AGENT HADLEY: What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
AGENT HADLEY: Too many people know about my involvement in this.
SOPHIE: Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
