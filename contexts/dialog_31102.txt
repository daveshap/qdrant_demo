PACE: I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
LULA: Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
PACE: My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
LULA: Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
PACE: Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
LULA: And?
PACE: Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
LULA: Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
PACE: Why we sittin' here, mama?
LULA: Thinkin' a second, baby.
PACE: I'm scared, mama.
LULA: Why, honey?
PACE: Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
LULA: Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
