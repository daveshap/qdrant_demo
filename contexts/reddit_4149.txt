When your gut tells you to feel like something is rubbing you the wrong way don't ignore it. Stand up for yourself.
You're  gonna be a friend or dating and something will happen that someone does is going to make you feel some type of way.

Here's  a hint: don't ignore it. You're  feeling someway because theres a reason. You'll  run into alot of people that will tell you one thing  and do another. The older you get the less you pay attention  to the shit people say and the more you pay attention to what people do.

If some one calls you a friend they'll  value you and make themselves able to see you. Instead they wont go in the opposite.

There are tons of wolves in sheeps clothing out here. They'll  drain you, use you and then make you the villian in their sick game.

When you feel in your gut something isn't right you speak up for yourself and yes it may burn a bridge, but may the bridges  i burn light the way home.
