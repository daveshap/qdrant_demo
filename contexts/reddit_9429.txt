I used to ignore this advice but it helped me save $300 per month
To start, I know we're all at different levels and some people literally can't save. That's fine. This advice might not work for everyone.

But I used to ignore people when they said **just set your direct deposit to automatically transfer money from your paycheck to savings** . I thought that just wasn't *me*. I thought I'd inevitably end up taking the money out.

For some reason, I decided in October to try it. I set my direct deposit up to put $150 per pay period into savings. (You could set it to anything you can afford to spare. $10, $25, $500, $1000, whatever.)

Lo and behold, I've actually been able to stick to it. Sure, it's been insanely hard. I ended up with $4 in my checking account for about a week and ended up eating ramen several times. 

But that's okay because now I actually have a decent emergency fund. The thought of my car breaking down or my dog having a medical emergency doesn't give me panic attacks.

What's some advice you used to ignore but starting using with great results?
