Working in sexual assault advising, Title IX coordinating, student conduct, or similar sensitive positions
I'm considering multiple areas of higher education administration/student services. I'm particularly interested in becoming a Title IX Coordinator or otherwise someone who helps with cases involving sexual misconduct, students threatening one another, etc. However, I'm wondering how one would even get into this field. Since this kind of work is highly sensitive, how do you gain experience? I can't really intern in this position or sometimes even in these offices. Do I need to get a JD or law degree? Do I need to start in a different kind of office? Just having trouble envisioning this path!
