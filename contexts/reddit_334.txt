Friend Talking About Shooting School
Throwaway obviously

Preface:

My friend has had a very troubled life. I've known him a long time. 

To be honest we're just friendly acquaintances but we went to the same elementary school, and ended up in the same middle school and high school (there's a lottery to get in). 


He has a really shitty family life, and he's a closeted gay person who also pimps himself out to old guys for money. The counselor and a few other people know about it. He says some kids at school said something about him to the principal and it could ruin his life. If it does, he says he might kill those people and then himself.

He would also kill himself if I reported him.

I'm not really sure where to go from here.
