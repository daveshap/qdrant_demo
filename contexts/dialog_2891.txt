LT. WALKER: You sure?
NICK: I'm sure.
NICK: Now what?
LT. WALKER: What now what? Now nothing. She passed the polygraph. That's it.
NICK: She knew she could beat it. That's why she asked to take it.
LT. WALKER: How the fuck do you know? What is it with you and this broad anyway?
NICK: Come on, Phil. You're not gonna let this slide. What about her parents? What about what else she's published? At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
LT. WALKER: Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written. What are you -- a book critic?
NICK: How did they die? Was there an investigation?
LT. WALKER: How you're saying she killed her parents? Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
GUS: Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
LT. WALKER: Maybe she did, Gus. Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face. Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
NICK: Fuck you, Phil.
LT. WALKER: Fuck you, too Nick.
