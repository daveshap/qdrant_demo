Compiling white papers from your own written work/exams
So I have written many multi-page reviews and "science musings" as required by my graduate courses and written exams. I think there are some pretty good ideas contained in them which I would like to present in a way that gets me noticed by employers (in industry). I know authoring specialized white papers can be effective in getting your name out there. 

I want to reuse parts (as in 50% copy-paste content) of my previous works (not published) to make white papers and put those on my personal website. What is the ethicality of this though, especially if those works are previous written exams?
