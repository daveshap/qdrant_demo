Trying to remember an English word that means \u201cturmoil\u201d or \u201ctumult\u201d The word is something like \u201cfufura\u201d or \u201cfurfuraw,\u201d and I have even found a couple of web pages in which people use the latter in precisely the way I would use the word I\u2019m trying to remember. But the thing I\u2019m trying to recall would be on more than a couple of pages.
