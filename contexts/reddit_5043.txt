“We do not provide interview feedback.”
I got a rejection after a first round interview at a company I really wanted. When I asked for feedback, they just told me “we do not provide interview feedback.” Is there a good reason why they won’t? I feel like if I took the time to interview, the least you could do is let me know what happened that turned you off.
