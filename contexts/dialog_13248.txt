MINERVA: Cool, isn't it? Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical. On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart. Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
HAWK: Alchemy.
DARWIN: Alchemy! Is the business term of the 90's, my man! Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago. I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history. Money isn't everything, gold is. Fuck blue chip stocks! Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds! I got the real deal! Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
MINERVA: Market crashes. Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects. We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world. In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower. It's one party we'd love to poop.
DARWIN: Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
HAWK: Sure. The Kremlin. Makes sense. The Kremlin. Why not? Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man. Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
MINERVA: Jail, you asshole! Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out! Bunny, Ball-Ball!
DARWIN: I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career! I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
HAWK: You want an address on that last one?
HAWK: Bunny, not you too?
MINERVA: You've got a dilemma, tiger. I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
