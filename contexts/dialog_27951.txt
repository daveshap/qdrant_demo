THELMA: Well, wait now. I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
LOUISE: You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father? It's just two days. For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child. Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud. Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
THELMA: He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl. Are you at work?
LOUISE: No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
THELMA: I'll call you right back.
