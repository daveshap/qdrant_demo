Hello Millenials. I'm graduating university next year into the recession/depression, and I'm terrified. How did you survive the 2009 recession and its aftermath?
Hi! For the majority of my high school life/university career I've been working towards a creative communications career- pr, brand management, advertising. I've always been optimistic that I'd be able to either find or create opportunities for myself to make a good career path. I work part time for the canadian government, and I do some admin work for a small management company on the side. My plan had been to immediately move and find a job in my desired field, however I don't know how long the recession/depression is going to last after this and I don't want to be broke. So i guess my question is how did you survive the recession and is it possible to work jobs that are within your ideal career path but aren't as stable? How did you create a career path after the recession to a job that you do enjoy?
