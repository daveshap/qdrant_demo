It's like my students know when I need help.
This isn't a question about student affairs, or anything crazy. Just a weird coincidence...

So, for one of my classes, I need to interview three students of a certain identity. I chose queer students of faith, so those who identify strongly with a religion or spirituality and are also lesbian/gay/bisexual/queer/asexual. I work in the campus interfaith office, so I have close contact with students of faith.

I know one queer student of faith who attends another university in the area, so I reached out to them and asked if I could interview them. They said yes! Great, now I need two more. But I'm at a loss.

TODAY, I was sitting in the office and two students comes in. They said that they want guidance to start an interfaith student org...that focuses on LGBT students because they know several LGBT students of faith and want a space for them.

Needless to say, I definitely found my other interviews. Also, I hope this serves as a helpful reminder that students make space for what they want to see, so don't be worried about creating the perfect space :)
