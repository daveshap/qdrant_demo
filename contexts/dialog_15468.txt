JOANNA: I've seen him.
TED: You have?
JOANNA: A few times. Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
JOANNA: He looks like a terrific kid.
TED: He is... You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
JOANNA: Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
TED: You've been living here, in the city?
JOANNA: Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
TED: You want what?!
JOANNA: I want my son. I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
TED: Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
JOANNA: Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage-- Look, don't get so defensive, okay? It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
TED: Joanna, I don't give a--
JOANNA: Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child. I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get. Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink. Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
TED: Such as?
