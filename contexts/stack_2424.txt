Intersection of rasters in ArcGIS Desktop? I have two set of raster layers, one for buildings (static) and one for depth of surface water due to pluvial flooding from simulation (dynamic, changes with each time step). My aim is to generate an animation which shows buildings changing their color into red,yellow etc. as soon as water depth reach a certain value. For this purpose, I have to intersect building raster and water depth raster from different time instants. I have tried it with CON() tool in spatial analyst but the problem with CON() tool is that only the cells where water depth is reached or exceeded in the building raster are changed and not the whole building cells.Is there any way with which I can manage to change the color of the whole building (and not just the cells where water depth is exceeded) when even a single cell of that building reaches or exceeds a certain water depth?
