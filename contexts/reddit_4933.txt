I feel like a terrible person
Okay so recently my mom went on Facebook and said she was going to kill herself, she then went one and blamed two of my sisters and I. People at my school saw it and now everyone knows I’m the reason my mom wants to die. That’s not why I’m mad however, I’m mad because I have a 10 year old little sister that she was just going to leave, and even though I don’t talk to my mom everyday I’m still hurt that she was just going to leave me. I feel so guilty that I’m mad at her because I also struggle with mental health and I’ve been there before, and I’ve felt what she feels but I’m still SO angry at her. She’s never been the best mom, she’s hurt me in the past so many times and this whole thing makes me want to cut her off for good, and even though she’s hurt me so many times I know me wanting to just leave will hurt her, so I’m trapped. Please people of reddit, what should I do? And am I a terrible person for being mad at her?
