Is co-mentorship harder to maintain?
Hi. My current PI suggested me to do a co-mentorship since she cannot provide guidance in some perspectives of my project. Generally, shouldn't a co-mentorship be harder to maintain than just having 1 mentor? Is this a sign that maybe I should change lab?

PS: 1 PI is socially awkward and the other is super busy
