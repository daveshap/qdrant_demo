My position was cut $7,000, what should I do?
Last week, my position was eliminated and a new position was created $7,000 lower. The company is not falling on hard times, as they opened a position at a higher pay than mine and even gave a few people raises.

I feel so devalued as someone with a degree in computer science. I knew $47,000 was a low pay, but $40,000 feels unacceptable to me and a slap in the face. I’ll still have to apply and interview for this lower position and I don’t know if I should. If I don’t apply, I’ll be unemployed as of June 1st.
