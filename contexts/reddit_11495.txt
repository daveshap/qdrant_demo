I want to make native friends, but I don't party and my English isn't good enough for it.
It has been bothering me since I got in the United States this August. I'll stay here for one more semester, and I really want to know how I can improve this frustrating situation. 

I'm an male exchange student from Taiwan. My English isn't good enough for having close friends, especially for listening and speaking. Plus, I can't drink alcohol and don't know how to enjoy a party. However, I do want to make local friends though alternative ways.
I'm shy not because I'm afraid of initiating a conversation, but I worry people couldn't understand me due to the language barrier and they don't want to "wait" for me to finish a sentence. I don't want to "bother" people who don't want to listen to me, but I do want people to talk to me. Ironically, this dilemma bothers me. 

I tried many possible ways to gain more chances to talk to people. For example, I joined volleyball club and multicultural club. Also, I applied and got two internships during intersession and in the spring semester. Additionally, I am also a Chinese tutor for local students who take Chinese courses. I also have a roommate who is from Europe. I even applied for jobs in school. I tried hard to make me accustomed to speaking and listening English, but I still can't have lots of friends, especially American friends. 

How can I make this progress more effectively and appropriately?
What kind of thoughts/philosophy should I keep in mind? 
Is there any resource available to me that I can use for it?
What do Americans expect when it comes to making friends. 

Thank you all for listening. I just want to share with you. if anyone can give me any suggestion, I would be more than happy to see a response. Thank you in advance.
