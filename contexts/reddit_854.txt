I’m anorexic and have several anxiety disorders and I went grocery shopping by myself for the first time in 6 months! ☺️
I’m 23 and female and this was just really reaffirming

EDIT** GUYS I didn’t expect to get so much love and kindness from you all!! This has quite literally made my day and in the running for my month lol.  These struggles are so rough and facing it everyday is really something.  But; struggling does not negate your strength.  We are infinite wells of resilience because we have to be, we all deserve love and kindness and warmth every single day.  ❤️❤️

For reference these are my diagnoses:
Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Social Anxiety Disorder
Panic Disorder
Body Dysmorphia  
Anorexia Nervosa
PTSD from childhood emotional/physical abuse 
PTSD from being raped when I was 17
PTSD from the illness and death of my mom at the age of 12 

I’ve been unemployed for 6 months and my last job was in a RAMPANT environment of sexual harassment it was disgusting.

I believe in you all.  Be gentle on yourself first and always.  Don’t let the world and your illness rule your life.  Filter what you take in and surround yourself with.  Thank you all. 😊❤️
