Anyone have experience quitting a job that was mentally and physically draining to the point of burnout and unhappiness, but paid well, without knowing what else to do-and been successful?
Title says it all. I know this job is having an effect on my health. I work 60+hrs per week, I’m anxious and depressed (depressed before the job, though. It’s just not making it any better). I’m not taking care of myself. But it pays ok and I don’t know what else I would do. I’d like to take the parts of this job that I enjoy-or used to enjoy-and combine them in one role but I don’t think that exists or haven’t been able to find anything close that pays what I need. 

It’s easy to say, “your health is important, just quit!” But that’s really not practical. So I’m wondering if anyone else has been in the same situation and actually succeeded...
