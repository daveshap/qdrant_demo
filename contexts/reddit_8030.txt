One of my labmates told me that she owes over 170K in student loans
A friend of mine is going through some hard times that pertain to his student loans, so I was discussing it with one of my labmates. Just casual conversation. Then she off-handedly mentioned that she owes over 170K in loans herself.  I can't stop thinking about it. I'm completely in shock. 

We're in a fully-funded program, but we don't make much stipend-wise and the cost of living is high. That, along with her prior degrees from a private college and some medical issues, brought her to this point. 

I love what I do, but I wouldn't pay that much money for it. We're not even in a high-paying field. How does someone cope with that? Do you just make minimum payments until you die?

[Side note: She said that she doesn't mind if I talk about this with other people because it might spread some awareness, but I won't share any of her personal information (school, age, name, etc.).]
