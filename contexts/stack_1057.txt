Unable to open a SD Card, but it is OK on a Mac After using SanDisk SD cards for at least two years on a PC, first with Ubuntu 16.04 and more recently 18.04 today I was unable to \"open\" an SD card though visible in \"Files\". The data had been entered onto the card by the same PC.I fished out my old 2004 MacBook Pro and the card behaved normally in the Mac, I even formatted it as FAT but back in my PC under Ubuntu, though it seemed to be working again (I copied a file to it and was able to open it) I couldn't format it. On requesting a Ubuntu format on the first mask I could choose NTFS (already chosen by the system) or FAT but on clicking on \"Next\" nothing happened whether the choice was NTFS or FAT.Finally I rang SanDisk and they simply said that they didn't support Linux!Does anyone know of any Linux supported SD cards?Bob
