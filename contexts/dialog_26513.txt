LUTHOR: Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
OTIS: Yessir. Just what you wanted.
OTIS: There.
LUTHOR: Not there! A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
OTIS: Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
LUTHOR: Excellent, Otis. But what took you so long?
LUTHOR: What's the matter, Otis?
OTIS: Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
LUTHOR: Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
LUTHOR: I broke the man out of prison --
OTIS: I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
LUTHOR: I gave him steady employment --
OTIS: I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
LUTHOR: I gave him this new face.
OTIS: I...uh...check.
LUTHOR: And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again. Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
OTIS: I guess I...uh...regressed.
