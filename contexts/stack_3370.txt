1950's Sci-Fi graphic short story about a farm boy, his ham radio and a tiny rocket ship landing in sauerkraut This story was about a farm boy who built a ham radio and found himself communicating with aliens on a space ship heading towards Earth. The townsfolk and army gather for the event with food vendors (maybe carnival stuff as well) and the aliens describe how they have landed in a lake of acid with giant plants/monsters in it and die as they are crushed to death by the giant things.It ends with the farm boy being arrested as the Army General begins eating a hot dog with sauerkraut and bites down on something hard... it is the tiny space ship that no one had seen. I think it may have been in an issue of Weird Fantasy or Weird Science but I'm not really sure.It was a rather short graphic novel style. There was no video, only communication over the farm boy's ham radio. The boy talked to the approaching aliens while everyone listened and looked everywhere for the ship about to land. It landed in a vendors tray of sauerkraut and the 'acid' was pitting the ships hull and portals. The giant monsters that were crushing the ship were the General\u2019s teeth.
