BOBBY: Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
LAURA: What was?
BOBBY: The stuff we got last night.
LAURA: Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
BOBBY: No shit... We killed a guy for baby laxative.
LAURA: What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
BOBBY: Don't get funny with me again.
LAURA: I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
BOBBY: Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
LAURA: Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
BOBBY: Let's ditch this place and party.
LAURA: Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
BOBBY: Why? Why not? Where are you goin'?
