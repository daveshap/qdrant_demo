Unpopular opinion: No one cares how you got into Stanford if your GPA was 7.0 and a 1800 SAT and founded Google
Literally every single YouTube video on my recommended is "how I got into ____! Stats and ECs"  and then go on to say "I didn't have perfect stats. My SAT was only a 1590!  I honestly don't think SAT and GPA are important just be passionate". Like bro stfu we get it you're smart. No need to rub it our faces. They act like they try to give people hope but really end up discouraging people even more. Only make those videos if your stats are ACTUALLY not perfect. Then, your videos would help people. And emphasize the video on your essays rather than your stats since "that's what matters"
