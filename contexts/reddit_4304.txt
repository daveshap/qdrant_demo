26M, just broke down crying because I've never had a girlfriend. I swear, being autistic is worse than having an STD
As the title says, and I'm a virgin (I've fooled around with 2 women but have never done penetrative sex). I'm getting fucking desperate.

Some asshole is probably going to tell me to "man up" or "stop being a baby", but hear me out. I work a minumum-wage job and have my own place. I'm also going to a university for a mechanical engineering degree. I am part of a running club, and automotive engineering club, and a comedy/improv club.

I work out, and am a half-marathoner. I am white, 6'2", 200lbs, and have long, curly hair with a light beard. I have been told that I have "no bad features". I play guitar and bass in my free time, draw, record my own music, and love Star Wars and a lot of post-apocalyptic horror.

The number of different women I've dated + cuddled with + fooled around with is 31. Of those, 11 of them were willing to go on a second date. Of those, I took 6 of them up on their offer. With 2 of them, we couldn't agree on a relationship or FWBs. One led me on for three dates and broke my heart. With another two, either of us broke it off after the second date. However, I only met one of these 31 women at my school.

I am extremely shy, to the point where I broke down crying in the bathroom during a company party two months ago because I realized that I didn't have any friends there. I didn't make any friends throughout my entire high school life, but it's gotten better since then. However, all of my friends of both genders like me, and say that I'm fun and interesting to talk to. Not trying to be a "nice guy", just trying to mention that I don't have an atrocious personality.

My shyness is probably not going to improve very much. I've built up confidence, and a huge amount of social skills. but it has been extremely slow. Don't advise me to make any major changes quickly, it's just not going to happen.

* I ***LOATHE*** dating apps. They're boring, tedious, time-consuming, and brutally competitive. I also find that I meet much better people in real life than on apps.
* Although I prefer bigger/chubbier women, I'm not particularly picky about looks. I've liked and have dated short, tall, skinny, athletic, chubby, SSBBW, and everything in between.
* My views are close to the center and I actively avoid politics - so I don't hold any toxic/extreme views.
* I have a somewhat low libido, so it's not like I only care about sex. I would much prefer a genuine, wholesome relationship.

Two nights ago, I went to the hot tub with some of my buddies and drank a few beers. They were talking about women and sex, as if sex comes so easy for them and they don't even have to think about whether or not they ***can*** get a girlfriend or sex, where I can't even afford to be picky, and have to wait for the first woman to show interest in me.

It's so crazy. Like, one of the perverts on Chris Hansen's TCAP recently got married. So this overweight guy with a minimum-wage job who was literally jailed for attempting to groom and rape a little girl, eventually finds the love of his life. But I'm a mostly-functional human with 0 criminal history who has never even had one girlfriend.
