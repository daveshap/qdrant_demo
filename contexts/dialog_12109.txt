WENDY: What are you doing?
PIXEL: Nothing.
WENDY: You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
PIXEL: When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority? Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
WENDY: Geez, what time is it? I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is. I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...
PIXEL: I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
WENDY: Why do you even like me?
PIXEL: You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
WENDY: I'm not a nai-ive little...
PIXEL: Uh-huh.
