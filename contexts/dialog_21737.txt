WINTON: Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
FLORENCE: Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
WINTON: Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
FLORENCE: What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
WINTON: I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
FLORENCE: All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
WINTON: Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
FLORENCE: I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
