ARMITAGE: The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
CASE: What does this have to do with me?
ARMITAGE: Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
CASE: Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
ARMITAGE: Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
ARMITAGE: If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
CASE: My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
ARMITAGE: What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
CASE: I'd say you were full of shit.
CASE: Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
ARMITAGE: First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
CASE: It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies. Terms?
ARMITAGE: We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
CASE: Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
ARMITAGE: Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
