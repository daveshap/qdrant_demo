What should I expect in a masters program vs undergrad?
I graduated with a BA in psych in 2018, needless to say back then I didn’t take school seriously and just went through the motions. 

I’be just been accepted into Capella’s MPH program, I am going this route because I hated sitting in a classroom. I prefer to learn things on my own. This is the first time I’m actually excited for school. 

I was looking at the academic plan for me and I’m looking at it as “this is it?” or “I can handle double this amount”. I’m going full time, and my first session is one 4 credit class the remainder is two 4 credit classes. I spoke to my admissions counselor and they explained there’s only one class with quizzes, the rest is papers and discussions. Writing has always been my strong suit. 

What should I be expecting in a grad program? How much time should I expect to put in per week? How much should I expect to write? any other information would be great.
