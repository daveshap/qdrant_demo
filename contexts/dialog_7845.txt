MAPES: Do you know this my lady?
JESSICA: It could only be one thing.... It's a crysknife.
MAPES: Say it not lightly... Do you know its meaning?
JESSICA: Here is why this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. Shadout is Chakobsa... knife, in Chakobsa is... maker of death. It's a maker...
JESSICA: Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close... Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
MAPES: My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
