MongoDB Embeded Index we have a collection in below format:{    \"_id\" : {        \"a\" : 8,        \"b\" : ObjectId(\"5b23aa9e24826b82a2553ce7\")    },    \"field1\" : \"value1\   \"field2\" : \"value2\   \"field3\" : \"value3\   \"field4\" : \"value4\",}as per my knowledge, MongoDB creates a default index on _id field. But here in this case I want to know how MongoDB will create index on _id; is it on both _id.a and _id.b field or just on _id.b field? also if I create an additional compound index on (_id.a,field1,field2), will it create an additional overhead? or I need to create and index on only (filed1,filed2) as _id is already indexed field. Please suggest. Thanks!
