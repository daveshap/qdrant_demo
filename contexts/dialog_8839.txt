DR. KLEIN: She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
CHRIS: What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
DR. TANNEY: Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
CHRIS: So what's wrong with her?
DR. KLEIN: We still think the temporal lobe...
CHRIS: Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
DR. TANNEY: There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
CHRIS: So what's next?
DR. TANNEY: A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
CHRIS: Oh, Christ.
DR. TANNEY: What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
