RHEYA: Don't do this. I am literally begging you not to do this. Chris.
KELVIN: You should have told me.
RHEYA: It wouldn't have made any difference.
KELVIN: Thank you.
RHEYA: Chris, I had to. I had to. I didn't think you'd react like this.
KELVIN: Neither did I.
RHEYA: You never said you wanted one.
KELVIN: I never said I didn't.
RHEYA: Chris --
KELVIN: I can't stay here.
RHEYA: Chris, please. Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
KELVIN: Then you won't make it.
