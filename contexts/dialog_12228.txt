HAROLD: Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
MAUDE: Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals. Of course, the age has its advantages.
MAUDE: The universal language of mankind. What music do you like, Harold?
HAROLD: Well...
HAROLD: What happened?
MAUDE: Look.
HAROLD: What?
MAUDE: Over there by the courthouse.
HAROLD: What is it?
MAUDE: That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
MAUDE: Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
HAROLD: But what?
MAUDE: We'll transplant it. To the forest.
HAROLD: But we can't just dig it up!
MAUDE: Why not?
HAROLD: But this is public property.
MAUDE: Exactly.
HAROLD: Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
MAUDE: Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
HAROLD: Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
