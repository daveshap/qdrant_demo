SORAN: I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
LA FORGE: I was ordered to by the Captain.
SORAN: Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it. Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
LA FORGE: No.
SORAN: What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
LA FORGE: Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
