Extracting data from string for query? I am attempting to identify utility poles that require inspection. Currently, the feature has a field containing the pole's birthmark in a string format and an installation date field (with the majority being null values at the moment). The birthmark field is formatted as 40-5-18 where 40 is the height, 5 is the class, and 18 is the year. I need a Python solution to capture the last two digits of the birth mark string and either update the installation date field to some arbitrary date in the corresponding year or select values (&lt; or > a particular year) using a mathematical operator. The ultimate goal is to be able to query poles due for inspection based on the date of the birthmark or installation. Thoughts?
