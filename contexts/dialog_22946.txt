JIM: What happened to you?
DIANE: Dad, did you do it? Did you take that money?
JIM: Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous.
DIANE: Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
JIM: Honey!
DIANE: Swear to god.
JIM: I swear to god.
DIANE: But I found the money.
JIM: Honey, it's not what you think.
DIANE: What am I supposed to think?
JIM: Honey, about what?
DIANE: You stole from them, you lied to me. How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
JIM: You think you know what this money is?
DIANE: Yes, I...
JIM: No, you don't know what it is. It's not for me. This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again. Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do. I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
DIANE: No, but you stole from them.
JIM: I made their lives better.
DIANE: You let me believe you. You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it. God, how... how could you...
JIM: Alright, alright. Go ahead. When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
DIANE: I trusted you. I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
JIM: Why are you being so hateful to me? Is this because of Lloyd?
DIANE: No. I told you everything, you lied to me. I would have done anything for you.
JIM: That's right, work it out.
DIANE: No, I will. I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you. You're a liar, and a thief.
JIM: Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
DIANE: I'm so ashamed dad.
JIM: Don't say that, it's not good for you. You're...
DIANE: You're right.
