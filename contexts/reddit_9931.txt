Access & "Real Talk" about college cost
I was watching a thread on Twitter yesterday from @istudentaffairs talking about how we need to be more realistic about talking incoming students and the overall cost of college. 

I'm torn. Part of me acknowledges that the amount of debt that you can leave with does not always reflect the amount of money you are going to make (I graduated with a BA in English and MA in Higher Ed/Student Affairs, which does not translate into how much I spent to get my degrees). I also recognize that without the loans I have accrued, I would not have been able to attend college. 

So, my question to you all of you lovely Reddit friends. How do you balance these two forces? Access to college being harder and harder with rising costs, but also have "real talk" about long-term implications of tuition costs and going into fields that may not yield a salary you can really live on, while paying off loans. 

Thoughts? Experiences?
