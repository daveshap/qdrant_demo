Salary Negotiation
I'm in a rather unique position and I'm hoping someone out there can offer some advice.  I've never negotiated a salary before so I've been doing some research on the subject.  Everything I read says to know your value in the job market.  

Here is where my dilemma begins, I am in a highly technical field.  I am lucky enough to have become one of, if not the top person in the field.  This has led to my latest job opportunity, and subsequent salary negotiations.  

Now my research efforts on sites like Glassdoor have not been very successful.  I do know my skills are very high in demand, and very few if any qualified people exist to fill those positions.  I have about a 5 year head start on any competition and I really want to try and capitalize on that.  My issue is no one has any published or community based information on salary ranges.  Trying to link up a few other close careers to mine have yielded very different numbers.        

I already have the upper hand walking into the negotiations, however I don't want this lack of information, arguably the most important information, to be used against me.  Will I be insulting to HR and my new management to begin negotiating very far to the right side of the pay scale?  I'm talking in the range of 30k to 40k more then what I would normally expect.  Without any baseline numbers it is hard for me to even estimate where to begin the negotiations.  

If anyone has been in a similar situation, or been involved on the other side of the table in these types of negotiations any advice would be most helpful.
