I’m Going Crazy
It’s the last two weeks of the semester and I’m at my wits end. Not only do I have a paper due almost every day next week, the stress of traveling home (it’s a 6 hour ride), but now I’m apparently ineligible for three of my student loans for the next semester. Just more to add to the fact that money is tight and the fact that my mom was told she might have lymphoma or something worse that’ll kill her. Still on edge and waiting to hear back about her results. Seriously close to losing my cool at this point and don’t know what to do besides stay calm and act like nothings bugging me.
