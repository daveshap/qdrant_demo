MADMARTIGAN: Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
WILLOW: I hate this.
MADMARTIGAN: Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why? Nobody cares... Except me. You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
WILLOW: You don't know anything about ba- bies.
