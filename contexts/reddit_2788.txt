Does Anyone Else Experience Tunnel Vision at Work or "Lose the Forest Through the Tress"?
Does anyone else have this problem? I am in project management so this can cause issues. But, it mostly only occurs due to the following:

1. I am surprised with a task and anxiety or pressure takes over.
2. The specific task requires me to be focused for a long period of time.

One example happened just yesterday. It was my first day on the job and I was so focused on completing tasks on this new higher checklist that I failed to realize there were two other related documents listed within a specific task's text that had to be completed. It was 3:30 and these were due at EOB. I quickly started on these documents and realized today that on the Excel document I over looked the instructions tab and other tab I had to fill out.

My old manager gave me this feedback at my previous job and I am afraid I am not improving. I can't help but feel like I have tunnel vision.

Any ideas on how to combat this?

Thanks.
