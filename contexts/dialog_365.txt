MRS MATHEWS: Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother. Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time. That's when you start going to church.
WELLES: We're all like that.
MRS MATHEWS: Are you religious?
WELLES: No.
MRS MATHEWS: You should be.
WELLES: I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
MRS MATHEWS: What?
WELLES: It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons. When kids run, they almost always leave a note. It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
MRS MATHEWS: There wasn't one. The police looked.
WELLES: Do you think the police did a good job?
MRS MATHEWS: I don't know. I think so.
WELLES: It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it. She might have wanted to tell you something...
MRS MATHEWS: No. You don't have any reason to think that...
WELLES: If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place.
MRS MATHEWS: How... how can you say that to me...?
WELLES: Will you let me look?
MRS MATHEWS: My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
WELLES: You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go. Police are just as human as you or I. They could have missed something. They probably didn't. Wouldn't you rather know?
