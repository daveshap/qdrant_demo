SONNY: We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks. I want to get things going good before he gets better. What's the matter with you?
HAGEN: You start operating, the five families will start their raids again. We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
SONNY: No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
HAGEN: Yes. That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
SONNY: Well it's war! We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian. Pop had Genco, who do I have? Hey Tom, hey...hey. It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner. Don't be sore.
