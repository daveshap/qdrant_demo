JACK: Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady. That's all I ask.
GRADY: Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
JACK: For the moment, Mr. Grady. Only for the moment.
GRADY: I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance. I fear that is the only thing to do.
JACK: There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
GRADY: You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
