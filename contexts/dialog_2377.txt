REV. SULLIVAN: I'm asking how much.
JAMIE: Dad --
REV. SULLIVAN: It's time to tell him. It would be the right thing.
JAMIE: Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
REV. SULLIVAN: No. I want what's best for you.
JAMIE: This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
