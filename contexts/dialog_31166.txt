GRANT: We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science. And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
JIM: Nicely said, sir.
GRANT: Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
GRANT: Goddamnit! What am I doing? What's happened to all my cigars? Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year. No arrests, no leads, no clues...
JIM: And?
GRANT: And now the job's yours.
