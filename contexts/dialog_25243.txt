KIRK: Where are you going?!
SPOCK: To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
KIRK: Bones, stay here.
BONES: No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
KIRK: Spock...?
SPOCK: As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
KIRK: Whales?
SPOCK: Specifically, Humpback Whales.
BONES: That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
