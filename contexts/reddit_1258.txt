Going non verbal when you're upset/stressed?
Does anyone else go nonverbal when theres too much going on and your stressed out and have major sensory overload. I was forced to a family members house for the holidays and I just want to cry, there is absolutely no privacy, only two bedrooms so I dont even get to escape the people and socialization because my bedroom is the couch. I can hear every noise anyone in this house makes and I just want to punch something. When I get like this it feels physically impossible to talk and people just keep talking to you even though you clearly dont want to. this was just a little bit of a rant because I needed it, but i was wondering if anyone else goes non verbal in stressful situations.
