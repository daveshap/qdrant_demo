Can spontaneous fluctuations cause instantaneous non-equilibrium? The fluctuation-dissipation theorem says that the linear response of a given system to an external perturbation is expressed as the fluctuation properties of the system in thermal equilibrium.Does this mean that the spontaneous fluctuations cause instantaneous non-equilibrium, and the long-time average is the equilibrium?
