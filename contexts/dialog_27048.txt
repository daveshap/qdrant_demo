WILSON: I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me. She was always so embarrassed.
ELAINE: Not embarrassed.
WILSON: Ashamed.
ELAINE: Not ashamed.
ELAINE: Disappointed.
WILSON: She never told Eddie, though.
ELAINE: She never told anyone else. About the convict strain -- or is it stain? No, I was privileged. I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
WILSON: How'd you manage that, then.
ELAINE: When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach. Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress. Not with that look.
WILSON: Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
ELAINE: Modelling.
WILSON: Learnin' 'ow to speak proper. Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen. They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny. She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper. Show up the old man, you know.
ELAINE: You weren't disappointed in her, then.
WILSON: In Jenny? 'Course not. How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
ELAINE: She was twenty-one when she came to me. ... Straight from leaving you.
WILSON: Footloose and fancy free.
ELAINE: She was happy here. However the two of you might have parted. Don't think she wasn't.
