MCMURPHY: Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
SPIVEY: Oh, what was that?
MCMURPHY: Poker!
SPIVEY: I see.
MCMURPHY: Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
SPIVEY: In what way?
MCMURPHY: They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
SPIVEY: I see...
MCMURPHY: To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
SPIVEY: Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
MCMURPHY: Well, ya know, Doc... Doesn't it say so there?
SPIVEY: Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.' What do you think of that report?
MCMURPHY: I don't, Doc...
SPIVEY: Arrested on an assault charge five times...
MCMURPHY: That's correct, Doc ...
SPIVEY: The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
MCMURPHY: Doc, what can I tell ya?
SPIVEY: Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
MCMURPHY: No, this is my first trip, Doc.
SPIVEY: Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
MCMURPHY: You bet, Doc!
SPIVEY: Good. Good.
