Rose International?
Anyone have any experience with a recruiting firm called Rose International? I’ve gotten some bait from them over the past few days on Twitter, they appear to be a third party recruiting firm based out of India which legitimate companies use to recruit people for mostly temp office positions that require particular experience or skills. I can’t quite tell if it’s a scam or not, Google seems to indicate that there’s some legitimacy here, but that information can also be easily manipulated as well. I’m not necessarily interested in taking a chance with a temp role at the moment, but is it even worth it to respond to these people or is it a phishing trap?
