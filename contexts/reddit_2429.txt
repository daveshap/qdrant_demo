How important to you is it to have a good boss?
In my experience having a good manager/boss can really make the difference between liking and hating a job. In fact, part of why I like my job so much is because of my manager and his friendliness and flexibility. But is this a deal breaker for others? If you have or have had a terrible manager did it make you want to quit? Or were there other aspects of your job keeping you there even though your boss made you want to leave? And do you feel a good boss is vital to a positive and productive workplace?
