What does Jeff Sessions' departure as Attorney General mean for the Mueller investigation?
Today Jeff Sessions resigned as US Attorney General [after being requested to do so by President Trump.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/us/politics/jeff-sessions-fired-trump.html)

Sessions [had been recused](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-sessions-statement-recusal) from oversight of the probe currently being run by [special counsel Robert S. Mueller](https://www.justice.gov/sco) into any links and/or coordination bet ween the Russian government and individuals
associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.

That had meant [Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had been supervising that investigation.](https://www.lawfareblog.com/how-rod-rosenstein-protects-mueller-investigation)

Trump announced that instead of Rosenstein who is [2nd in command at DoJ](https://www.justice.gov/agencies/chart) he would name [Matthew Whitaker, who was Sessions' Chief of Staff as acting Attorney General.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-resigns-at-trumps-request/2018/11/07/d1b7a214-e144-11e8-ab2c-b31dcd53ca6b_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_hp-breaking-news%3Apage%2Fbreaking-news-bar&tidr=a_breakingnews&utm_term=.97e85f669551)

What is known about Whitaker's career and history, and any attitudes or positions taken related to the Mueller probe?

What power would Whitaker have to curtail or terminate the investigation?
