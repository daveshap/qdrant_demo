RAJA: We're outnumbered twenty to one.
SHOVELER: It's suicide.
FURIOUS: Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
FURIOUS: And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
SPHINX: Now you're talking.
BOWLER: Sounds good to me.
RAJA: Let's do it.
