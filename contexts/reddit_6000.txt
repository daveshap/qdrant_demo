Computer science degree or economics degree
I plan to be an entrepreneur in the future. In my country we get "free" university education so even when i think education is pointless and everything can be learned by my own effort i still dont want to waist the potential gains of having a degree. My picka are between something in economics or something in computer science. What do you guys think and why?
