Is it ok to do parameter tuning after cross validation? I am thinking of using cross validation to select the best algorithm (e.g. SVMs, Random Forest), and then doing parameter tuning on the selected algorithm to build a model.Is it acceptable and how it is different from nested cross validation, where both parameter tuning and performance evaluation are done before building a model?
