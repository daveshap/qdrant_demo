I don’t want to die, but I no longer want to exist.
There is no point to this. Society has made it almost impossible to not live in a damn cycle of work come home, get 2 hours to yourself, go to sleep. And then you get to do it again. 
If that’s all there is, why even continue on.
I’m never getting married or having kids, for personal reasons..So I don’t have a responsibility to continue on either, but I know I could never kill myself, which makes it even harder. I know there will be no relief for the pain I feel every god damn day. I’m jealous of everyone who is content living like a damn robot slaved to society doing the exact same thing everyday. I wish I could be happy doing that, but I just feel like I’m wasting my damn life away.
