JULIEN: This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
MARCEL: The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
DANIEL: You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
JULIEN: I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus
SAMI: Yeah, but you did do it. So let's deal with that.
