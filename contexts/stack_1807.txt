Is there a formal word for \"crush\"? I'm writing an assignment on how a poem of my choosing represents a person in my life. I'm trying to use the word \"my crush\" in the essay, but I looked it up in a dictionary and it's an informal word. Is there a formal word for \"a crush\"?An example sentence would be: <blockquote>  \"The speaker of the poem describes a person that closely resembles my  crush\".</blockquote>
