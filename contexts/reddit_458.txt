I need an opinion about dating.
I’m a 15 y/o boy and I’ll b 16 at the end of March. There’s this girl in a club I’m in who’s 16. Do you know that feeling you get where every time you see someone and they look at you it becomes impossible to not be happy? That’s the way I feel with this girl and she’s super cute and we’re both interested in the Same stuff and she just seems like a girl who would be right for me. However, I have only ever dated 1 other girl and I’m worried I won’t have a lot of time because I play 2 sports, and take advanced classes in school and the ref youth hockey on the weekends. It seems like she likes me too because whenever we make eye contact she smiles a little and looks away and seems like she is happy to talk to me. (We worked an event together today so we talked for like 3 hrs today). The only thing is: I am worried we wouldn’t be able to stay professional in the event we break up and I don’t want it to be awkward if we break up because in this club we need to be professional and be able to work well together. Any advise on what to do?
