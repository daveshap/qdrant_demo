ROYER-COLLARD: Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
COULMIER: His wife's influence.
ROYER-COLLARD: His wife's?
COULMIER: Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
ROYER-COLLARD: And he's never once attempted escape?
COULMIER: A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
COULMIER: Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
ROYER-COLLARD: What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
COULMIER: He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
ROYER-COLLARD: And his writing?
COULMIER: Oh. That.
ROYER-COLLARD: Well...?
COULMIER: It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
ROYER-COLLARD: Do you favor its publication?
COULMIER: For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
