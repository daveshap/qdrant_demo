Any reason to stay at non-public startup after getting fully vested?
I'm at a successful tech startup, where my future growth has been stalled for a couple of reasons. I fully vest my stock options this week, and am anticipating an offer from another successful non-public startup. 

The offer I'm anticipating would be a fairly lateral move, which I'm trying to avoid. But I also feel like I'm wasting time at my current company now that I'm finished with the vesting schedule. 

Outside of missing out on an acquisition, is there any reason to give my current job any more of my time?
