My ex-manager keeps trying to make me change fields
So I have completed a marketing internship at a world-famous multinational 6 months ago. However, despite succeeding at every task I've been given during these 6 months and having a good performance review, my ex-manager told me I should leave marketing because I'm not fit for it and should pursue a career in communications instead. At the time, I was too stunned to ask her what she meant by "not fit". Considering I got praise from other Senior Managers and did everything right, I decided not to listen to her and listen to my gut instead which told me marketing is for me.

Now, 6 months later, I asked her a recommandation letter to get into a MBA program and while she accepted to provide me with one, she still wrote in it that she hopes "I will find a new path with this MBA".

I really wonder: is she genuine or is she trying to sabotage my career? Also, this manager never cared about me, never asked personal questions and knew virtually nothing about me yet she's suddenly very invested in my career. Besides, she has always favored people with engineering background, playing favorite with them (I don't have an engineering background).

Do you think I'm in the wrong and I should listen to her or is she being malicious?
