SIDNEY: Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for? If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
SUSAN: Like you?
SIDNEY: Yeah! Like me! I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back! Let THEM choke, not me!
SUSAN: I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
SIDNEY: I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for? Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
SUSAN: I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
SIDNEY: I didn't do anything!
SUSAN: ...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
SIDNEY: Don't run away - I was always the man for you! I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say! Inside of six months -
SUSAN: Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
