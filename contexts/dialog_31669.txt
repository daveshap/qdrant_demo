XANDER: So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
PETRA: No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
XANDER: We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
PETRA: There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
XANDER: What's that?
PETRA: I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
XANDER: You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
PETRA: I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
XANDER: I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
PETRA: No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
XANDER: Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
PETRA: Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
XANDER: When can I see you again?
PETRA: You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
