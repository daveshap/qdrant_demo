MARA: Kalen will tire you out if you let him. He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
ALEXANDER: Your husband is dead?
MARA: He's gone to a better place.
ALEXANDER: It's hard for me to imagine a better place. Where I come from there's so much... frenzy. Day and night. It seems we're all running faster and faster... ... All in identical bowler hats.
MARA: You're not from beyond the valley.
ALEXANDER: What makes you say that?
MARA: We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you. And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
ALEXANDER: You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
MARA: Then you can speak slowly.
