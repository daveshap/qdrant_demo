SHIRLEY: I'm so frightened.
BOB: You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
SHIRLEY: Those creatures..!
BOB: Don't let them hear you.
SHIRLEY: What can we do?
BOB: I don't know. I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
BOB: Easy Shirley, Easy! Panic won't do us any good! Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
SHIRLEY: I'm afraid I'll faint.
BOB: Whatever you do, don't do that.
