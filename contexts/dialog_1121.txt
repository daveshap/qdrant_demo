OLD SALIERI: Well?
VOGLER: I regret it is not too familiar.
OLD SALIERI: Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing?
VOGLER: Oh, I know that! That's charming! I didn't know you wrote that.
OLD SALIERI: I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
VOGLER: Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
OLD SALIERI: Ah - you've heard that?
VOGLER: All Vienna has heard that.
OLD SALIERI: And do they believe it?
VOGLER: Is it true?
OLD SALIERI: Do you believe it?
VOGLER: Should I?
