PAULINE: I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
HONORA: comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
HONORA: Come on, sit up.
PAULINE: I'm not hungry.
HONORA: You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
PAULINE: I just want to be on my own for a while.
HONORA: starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
HONORA: You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
HONORA: holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
PAULINE: Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
HONORA: Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
PAULINE: But she'll have no one to look after her!
HONORA: Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
