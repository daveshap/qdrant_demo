It’s my 25th birthday
& ive never wanted to die more in my life

Edit: I had never been on this sub before. I typed suicide into the search bar after an intense breakdown. I wrote out my post and hit send. Force closed the app. I went for a walk with my son who’s under one. I forgot I had even posted this till right now while I’m sitting on the toilet a day later. I’m currently bawling my eyes out in relief. I am curious about the future. Today feels lighter than the societal pressures of yesterday. I am for lack of a better word overwhelmed by what an amazing community this sub is and I’m thankful for all of your support. Please keep pushing one day at a time if you felt anything like I did yesterday. For those of you asking, yes I have been through a tremendous amount of difficult lessons as I’m sure many of you have. I’m currently watching my mother battle her bipolar disorder while trying to raise a child hoping this won’t be his future watching me. But being rational enough to know mental illness is a constant battle. 

Thank you all again. I love myself. But I am exhausted. I feel as if I’m army crawling through life with bloody fingers.

But I’ll keep on keepin on.
