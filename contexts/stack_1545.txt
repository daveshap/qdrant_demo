How to rinse container used for ferric chloride etching? From what I have gathered online, after etching one stores the \"used\" ferric chloride (more specifically FeCl2 and CuCl) in some container which can then be taken to a waste disposal facility.What about the equipment you use? For example the container in which the PCB is soaked in? Can you rinse this container out in your sink? Or are you expected to use a new one each time and take the old one to a waste disposal facility?What about rinsing the board itself? Can you rinse it out in your sink (white porcelain, stainless steel), backyard? Or are you supposed to rinse it  and keep the contaminated water to later take to a waste disposal facility (along with the container that held the rinse water)?What do people do? This part is glossed over in every tutorial on PCB etching using ferric chloride that I've come across =/
