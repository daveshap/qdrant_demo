UTAH: Don't you gamble?
BODHI: Only make bets I can't afford to lose. Only way to be 100% committed.
UTAH: Who's the girl?
TYLER: Catch of the day.
UTAH: Oh, oh. That sounds personal.

UTAH: Meaning you were expendable.

UTAH: Sure, he's the Bodhisattva"."
TYLER: Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something. Maybe he has. You've seen him surf... that frenzy. It seems like anger. It's not. It's the energy of lovemaking. The sea is the woman in his life. She's his only true lover.
