Being paid to walk away from a job...should I?
So...USA here. I work in IT as a project manager/business analyst at a prominent shipping company, and they’re doing a voluntary buyout in lieu of a layoff, where you get 4 weeks of salary per year of work and a $35k medical stipend (for Cobra insurance and expenses). For me, it’s 1.5 years worth of salary I’d get as a lump sum to walk away...and my family could be debt free (sans Mortgage) taking this buyout.

My concerns are if I can get a comparable job soon enough to where I’m not eating away at that large payout for day-to-day needs...and how do I broach this subject with employers (and my resume) when I am looking again? 

I’m not really enamored with the job, though I do get lots of vacation and I have a very lenient schedule...so I’m thinking about leaving. Does a lenient schedule, four weeks of vacation, but little career advancement (so far) and no bonus or pay raise for the foreseeable future sound like a job worth holding on to?
