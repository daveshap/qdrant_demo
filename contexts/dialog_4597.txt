CAESAR: ... maybe three hours.
VIOLET: Caesar, what are you going to do?
CAESAR: What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
VIOLET: What?
CAESAR: Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
VIOLET: Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
CAESAR: No I didn't. Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here. Then they never showed up.
VIOLET: What happened to them?
CAESAR: I don't know. We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
