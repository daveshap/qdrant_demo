SALLY: Would you sign it for me?
PETER: Of course.
CLAIRE: I missed you.
PETER: Do you think they have a room here?
CLAIRE: How'd your interview go? I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
PETER: She's a talk show host. They can't be charmed. By definition.
FATHER JAMES: How're you doing? Looking lovely as always.
PETER: You ready?
