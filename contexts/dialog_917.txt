RIPLEY: No. There's no way!
BURKE: Hear me out...
RIPLEY: I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there? Forget it.
BURKE: Look, we don't know what's going on out there. It may just be a down transmitter. But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor. That's all.
GORMAN: You wouldn't be going in with the troops. I can guarantee your safety.
BURKE: These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
GORMAN: We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
RIPLEY: What about you? What's your interest in this?
BURKE: Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights. We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
RIPLEY: Yeah, yeah. I saw the commercial.
BURKE: I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
RIPLEY: That's right.
BURKE: Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
RIPLEY: It's all I could get. Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything. Days off are worse.
BURKE: What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
RIPLEY: If I go.
BURKE: If you go. It's a second chance, kiddo. And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it. You gotta get back on the horse...
RIPLEY: Spare me, Burke. I've had my psych evaluation this month.
BURKE: Yes, and I've read it. You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
RIPLEY: No! The answer is no. Now please go. I'm sorry. Just go, would you.
