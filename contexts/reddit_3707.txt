You should stop being afraid of expressing boundaries
Its hard to get over I know, but in the end expressing your boundaries is only going to help you find someone you’re compatible with quicker. 

I used to feel like I wasn’t allowed to express discomfort over certain things because my partner would get upset with me. That’s not a cool feeling! You should be able to tell your partner, “hey that actually makes me really uncomfortable.” If they get upset or disregard your feelings you will know they aren’t right for you.
