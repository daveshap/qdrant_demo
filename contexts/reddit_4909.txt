Epiphany...
Let’s see if I can explain this. I feel sad, I feel guilty or abnormal for feeling sad and then I spiral. I feel tired, I want to nap, I beat myself up for feeling this way and call myself lazy, etc. and spiral downwards. I’ve decided to eliminate all the judgement on myself for feeling the way I do. So I feel sad, it’s ok to feel sad- I’ll do something that usually distracts me or makes me feel better and eventually that feeling goes away. I want to nap- fine I’ll take a nap- eventually after an hour I feel rested and move on with my day. Typically, I go back in forth about whether or not I should take a nap, judging myself for wanting to nap and wishing I had more energy or could power through my day like all my “normal” friends. This turns into laying in bed for an hour spiraling into utter exhaustion so that I have to take a two hour nap just to recover. Anyone understand the spiraling and mental exhaustion that comes with judging yourself negatively for every feeling, thought, etc you have? I’m done with it!
