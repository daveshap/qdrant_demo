PONSONBY: Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two. The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend. He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
VICTORIA: Why?
PONSONBY: He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
VICTORIA: No. I shall be out walking.
