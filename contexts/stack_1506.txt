Can I replace a battery with a source of the same voltage but different capacity (mAh)? I have a device that has a bad battery and I am trying to find a suitable replacement. There are no replacement batteries for the device so I am trying to put something together myself. The original battery has written on it 3.7 V, 1.41 W. I have found a battery (CR123A) that is 3.7 volts and 700 mAh. Can I safely use it? Also, the original battery has 3 wires - red, white, and black. How would I connect the new regular battery?** It's for my Nest thermostat.
