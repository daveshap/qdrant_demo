Hey. Hey you. *gives Internet hug* It's going to be ok
Sometimes all I want is someone to hug me and tell me it's going to be ok. What's frustrating is that if I tell people this I feel like they'll just be doing because I told them I like it, and not because they actually care or because they actually think I'll be ok. 


Ive been lurking a while here and as shitty as it sounds its weirdly comforting to know I'm not alone, so thank you.

Sorry the body of this post isn't as happy as the title.
