PEGGY: What do you know about classical music?
CHARLIE: Nothing.. Selling is selling.
PEGGY: Charlie. About last nights..
CHARLIE: Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
PEGGY: But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
CHARLIE: Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
PEGGY: Why?
CHARLIE: Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
PEGGY: What am I going to do with you?
CHARLIE: Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
PEGGY: Hi, Dad.
MR. KELCHER: Doing some shopping?
MR. KELCHER: For me?
PEGGY: Open it.
