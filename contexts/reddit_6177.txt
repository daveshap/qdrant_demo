Got a new job but have questions about dress code?
I just got a job at a local, kinda ritzy hotel, and I was told the dress code for my position is business professional, and we wear suits/ties daily. When I interviewed, I was told uniforms would be provided, but I wasn’t interviewing for this particular position. I’m 18 and I don’t own a suit, so I don’t know what I am going to wear when I start on Monday. I tried contacting the lady who emailed me but I haven’t heard back. We are going into the weekend so I don’t know if I will.  I’m not sure what to wear....?

While looking online, I found that the male employees have to have, short professional hair, off collar, off ears. I have longish hair, but this never came up in the interview. Should I get a haircut for Monday?
