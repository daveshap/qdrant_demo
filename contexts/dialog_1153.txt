SCHLUMBERG: Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
MOZART: Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose. How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
FRAU SCHLUMBERG: Just one year.
MOZART: Who was your teacher?
FRAU SCHLUMBERG: I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
MOZART: Thank you, Madame. Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
