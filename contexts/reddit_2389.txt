I found my coworkers have a secret group chat where they slander my name or chat about me. What should I do?
Hard to explain this whole story. But essentially, I've discovered a secret group chat with my team, about 6 individuals total, all slandering and making fun of me, shaming me. For example, discussions I've had with ones on one's with each of them are all fine and dandy, and respectful, but they discuss my reply, or lack thereof, and assess. I also discovered the human resources point of contact is also in the bouts. I also discovered they have taken screenshots of my social media and posted it to their conversations to throw even more salt into the fire. 

This has absolutely broken my heart. And I'm not sure what to do. My mental health has not been good.
