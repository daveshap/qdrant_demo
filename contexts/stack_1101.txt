Service Broker-Certificate Not Found My organization has been successfully using service broker, dialog security, for a few years. I have a new instance of service broker that I would like to configure, but I believe I am running into a situation where the order in which the new broker instance is being incorrectly placed into the databases (with existing broker instances in place) causing the new broker instance to fail. My error is on the target server; Certificate Not Found. Security context could not be retrieved. My situation is:Source server A (dmz) sending to target server B, where there are already existing broker instances sending messages both ways but on different databases.Test 1: I switched the role of the source and target server around, making server B my source and server A (dmz) my target while using the same databases.  This was successful. Test 2: I dropped the test 1 instance and created 2 new databases on each server. I have again, reconfigured the source and target roles, now sending from server A (dmz) to server B and this was successful. There is only the one service broker instance configured in the new databases, so the order of placement is not an issue.I have come into this situation in the past when we first set up our dev/test environments; However, the situation was slightly different as many other broker instances were also failing. Not all of them, but some. Once I realized what was happening, dropping all instances and recreating them in a specific order, source instances before target instances, the situation was resolved. I would think that service broker would add a new instance in the correct place of order, automatically.Am I correct in thinking that the broker instances must be configured within a specific order? If so, how can I add new broker instances without interrupting what is already there? Please share your thoughts and suggestions.
