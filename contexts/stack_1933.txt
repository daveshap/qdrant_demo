To kill - Figurative Usages I've been thinking about the verb 'to kill'. There are many figurative extensions ('kill a ball' (stop it); 'kill time'; 'my feet are killing me'). What happens in times of war, for example, when the core meaning of the lexeme ('to put to death') will be used more frequently? Would you expect the figurative usages of this lexeme to decrease or remain?
