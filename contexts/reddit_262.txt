Seeking advice about friends
So there’s this guy that I’ve known for about two years. We’re in a group of friends, but the others more or less bully him from time to time. I want to speak up against the others, but it’s hard, as I‘be known one of them for 6+ years.

I also want to talk and make the first guy feel better, but there’s a problem: he’s super annoying. All the time he just goes on and on about a game or something that I haven’t heard of and absolutely don’t care about. He’s also very clingy and just not fun to be around. He has also done some weird things which I won’t go into detail on here, but let’s just say that there’s a reason the others are sometimes mean to him.

So, I want to “break up”  our friendship, as I just don’t have the energy to deal with him and manage school. But I feel bad, as I know he has multiple mental disabilities, few other friends and have had a hard time throughout his childhood.

Anyone who knows what I can do?
