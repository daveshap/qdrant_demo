I've finally hit my limit
I've been steadily getting worse over the past six months. No amount of medication seems to be helping, and I can't for the life of me seem to be able to get into counselling.

Finally got some respite in a small holiday for a wedding, and when it came to it I freaked out and missed the entire ceremony, set of the alarm to the villa and ruined everything. The reception is happening as I type this.

Now I'm just in bed absolutely dreading having to face everyone again. I've no handle on my anxiety and I've no idea where to even begin. 

I'm sick of fucking up absolutely everything. I can't do this anymore. 

I feel so ridiculous for being set off by this one little thing, but I've hit my limit. I plan on killing myself the night we get the plane back home. eeeh, thanks for letting me rant I guess. see you on the other side
