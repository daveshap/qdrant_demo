Me and my friend like the same guy
So I’m hanging out with one of my long time friends and we both realize that we have a shared liking from one of our mutual friends. We talked about it and she said that should be fine if I went for it and she wouldn’t be upset. But I still feel kind of weird about that and like I feel bad, even though she said it would be OK .  And she is my best fetal I don’t want this to make things awkward bc obviously she still likes him even if I do end up dating him.
I’m perplexed. Help pls.
