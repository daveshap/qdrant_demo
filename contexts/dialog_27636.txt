ADELE: Hi.
PETE: Hi.
ADELE: I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
PETE: Yeah? I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
PETE: This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
ADELE: Oh, yes. Yes, he was.
PETE: Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke. I know who I am now, and you don't. And... I don't like me very much.
ADELE: You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete. Pete. Pete. It's a nice name.
PETE: Thanks, I like it. I think.
