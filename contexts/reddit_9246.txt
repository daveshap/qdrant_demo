For the first time in 9 months I have a positive balance in my checking account and I've paid all my minimum payments on my credit cards
It's been a rough 9 months. I got behind on some credit card payments (2 are about to be sold to collections but I can't afford to pay the $500 minimum balances on them) and I was constantly overdrafting my checking account just to keep food in my fridge. Now thanks to some really strict budgeting and a reality check of my credit score (hello 499 score) I was able to pay all my bills that are due the first half this month and still walk away with $100 in my checking account. After my next check on the 15th and paying my bills I will hopefully have $300 left by October 31st! Thank you povertyfinance for getting me through these 9 months.
