MACFARLANE: Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
GRAY: I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
MACFARLANE: No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops! And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
GRAY: Aye, Toddy, there is something in what you say.
MACFARLANE: There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
GRAY: I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
