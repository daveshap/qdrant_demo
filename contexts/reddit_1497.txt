Our collective pep talk for today: It will all be okay
I want to put this in writing so I remember it, and so my fellow anxiety sufferers remember it:

This is not the end. This is a temporary situation. The only way out is through. (That last one, a therapist told me once when I was going through an extremely difficult time with my anxiety and depression.)

Those of us with anxiety know this feeling of sheer terror very well. It feels so familiar with us that at first, we weren't sure whether we need to panic. Then we panicked, because we are professional panickers. We are also professionals at getting through this. We have a unique set of skills!

My two main coping skills right now:

1) Thinking of time in two-week increments. Right now, my focus is on the next two weeks. (In the area of the US where I live, there are, for the most part, two-week closures.) So, okay, we get to the end of March, and we'll see how things look. 

2) Tune out the people who say..."this could go on for months/years/etc..." "life as we know it is over..." These are not healthy thoughts or sentiments, nor are they helpful. People that don't see things through a lens of generalized anxiety disorder DO NOT understand how triggering comments like these are. This is how we anxiety sufferers think on a daily basis, and we know how damaging it can be. Others do not, because they don't know about the spiral of unrealistic fears we can go into any other day of a normal, boring day/week/month/year.

I hope this helps. We are here to lift each other up. Let's not feed into each other's panic - let's keep things positive. It's not unrealistic to say, this too shall pass. Cliche, but true.
