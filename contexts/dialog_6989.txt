LLOYD: I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
PETER: We only live a few blocks apart.
LLOYD: This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
PETER: Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
LLOYD: She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
PETER: She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
LLOYD: Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
PETER: You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
