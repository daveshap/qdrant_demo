MACKELWAY: I think I talked to him.
KOESSLER: Who?
MACKELWAY: Speck. Harold Speck.
KOESSLER: From the grave?
MACKELWAY: MyDick.
SALINAS: MyDick?""
MACKELWAY: MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
SALINAS: I don't...
MACKELWAY: Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the item" screams
SALINAS: Speck is dead.
MACKELWAY: I talked to him.
KOESSLER: I'll relay this to CIIAC.
MACKELWAY: They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
KOESSLER: I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
MACKELWAY: I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
KOESSLER: The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
MACKELWAY: Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
KOESSLER: You refused to comply with a direct order.
MACKELWAY: I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
KOESSLER: Its called insubordination.
MACKELWAY: Then why do I still have a badge?
