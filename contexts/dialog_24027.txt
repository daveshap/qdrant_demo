EDDIE: From Vince? What a guy. Doo-lang, doo- lang.
CHRISTY: At least he's not a cop. At least he can afford a decent gift.
EDDIE: I used to buy.you,..stuff. On your birthday . When we were seeing each other.
CHRISTY: Yeah, like what? Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out? Lottery tickets? A travel iron?
EDDIE: So I don't shop.
CHRISTY: 'Cause you're always out, arresting people. Making trouble. I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing! I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
EDDIE: Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then. I told people you were a hooker!
