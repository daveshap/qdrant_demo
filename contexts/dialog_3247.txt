ADAM: Cabin fever, hon?
BARBARA: I can't clean anything. The vacuum is out in the garage. I can't leave the house. Why don't they tell us something? Where are all the other dead people in the world? Why is it just you and me?
ADAM: Maybe this is heaven.
BARBARA: In heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
ADAM: Hon... I didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me. As long as I never have to wash dishes again.
BARBARA: Dishes? We haven't eaten in three weeks! Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
ADAM: But I'm not hungry, are you?
