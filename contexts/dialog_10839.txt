VENKMAN: Pretty impressive, huh?
SPENGLER: It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
VENKMAN: From where -- Neptune?
SPENGLER: They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
VENKMAN: Ostrov? I've been there. Good party town.
STANTZ: My great-grandparents were Swiss. I still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
VENKMAN: Oh, right, you told me that. They came to America seeking other kinds of cheese, as I recall. How about you, Winston?
WINSTON: My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man. And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either. What are you, Dana?
VENKMAN: Miss Blue Blood? Her family's been here since the year 12.
DANA: That's not true. It was 1620.
VENKMAN: Same difference.
STANTZ: What's your story, Pete?
VENKMAN: Me? I'm a little of everything. Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around. And that's what made this country great.
DANA: That's a terrible thing to say.
VENKMAN: So what? It's a free country. Thanks, Lib.
