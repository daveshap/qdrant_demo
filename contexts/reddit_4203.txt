Do girls have a hard time holding eye contact with a guy they find attractive?
So last night, I (22M) was hangout with some girls (F22) that have been my ‘friends’ for about a year or so. We were just casually chatting in one of their apartments and I noticed that the girl I find attractive seemed to struggle with holding eye contact with me. She would be talking and would look at me for a couple seconds then like nervously look away and keep doing this. Do girls find it intimidating when guys hold eye contact, or is this a sign that she may find me attractive? 

TLDR; A girl that I’m into, was having a hard time holding eye contact with me, while we were talking.
