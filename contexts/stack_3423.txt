Difference between XML external entities and Remote File Inclusion attacks I was just studying about the XML external entities attack and Remote File Inclusion Attack. According to my understanding, the XML external entities attack is where the XML parser in the web application has the option of external entities enabled and the attacker can parse an external XML from a remote server and execute commands or read local system files.While the remote file inclusion attack is where the attacker is able to make the system execute the a file that lies on a remote server and the contents of this file may also be malicious and the attacker can access system level files or can even install a backdoor using this vulnerability. I am not able to differentiate between XML external entities attack and remote file inclusion attack as both the attacks mean that a remote file execution can lead to leaking of the information.
