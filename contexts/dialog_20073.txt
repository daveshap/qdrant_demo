PAULA: He ask you out for next weekend?
LYNETTE: No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
PAULA: I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
LYNETTE: You hope.
PAULA: He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
