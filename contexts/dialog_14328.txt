JACKIE: Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
NICOLET: You two meet?
JACKIE: This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
NICOLET: You talk to him?
JACKIE: Not really.
NICOLET: His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
JACKIE: What for?
NICOLET: Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
JACKIE: I imagine shit needs to be done.
NICOLET: We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
