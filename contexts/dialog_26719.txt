LISA: I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
MIKE: I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
LISA: Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
MIKE: Why not?
LISA: It's a rebound.
MIKE: We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
LISA: Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
MIKE: Six years.
MIKE: Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
LISA: Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
MIKE: Sorry, it's just that...
LISA: I understand.
