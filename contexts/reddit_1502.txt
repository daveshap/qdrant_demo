Co-workers were down playing anxiety yesterday. Pisses me off when I hear "everybody has some kind of anxiety."
To clarify, I don't have anxiety. But my husband does. I've seen first hand what it can do to someone. 

At work yesterday (I'm at a salon) my co-workers were gossiping about some former co-worker of theirs and talking about how much of an attention whore she was and how she's nothing but crazy and drama. Apparently this person is currently asking for money on a go fund me page so that she can get a companion dog. She also says that he would need training to help her with her panic attacks, night terrors, and bringing her medicine to her. I thought to myself, what's the big deal? 

But then they started saying things like "oh she just wants attention," "everybody has some form of anxiety," etc. I piped in and explained that things like panic disorder were a real problem for some people and that it's more than just everyday anxiety. The response I got was "well we know this girl, she just wants  attention. "Nobody with actual anxiety would actually tell other people about it." 

Now I don't even know this person they were talking about. Maybe she does just want attention. But maybe, just maybe, she is desperate at this point and is finally reaching out about her problem. Maybe a go fund me isn't the most practical approach, but it makes me so angry whenever people act like mental health is no big deal or just a way to get attention. I see the stories you guys post here. I have seen my own husband's anxiety and how it affects him. This shit sucks, and it's real.
