It's hard to be the strong one for your friends when you're going through your own issues.
I'm always the one my friends go to when they are going through something. Don't get me wrong, I love being there for them but sometimes it gets so hard for me because I feel like I don't have anyone to go to now. They don't know that I'm going through some stuff and I don't want to burden them with it because they're going through issues of their own. It's just hard.
