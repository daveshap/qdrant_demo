NEED advice for telling my friend how I feel about her.
Ok. Hi everyone, how are you all doing today? So I need some advice for fellow teens. I've been into my friend for the last 2 years and I REALLY like her, but I don't want to tell her, cause I'm afraid of the worst (whatever that may be). We've been friends for about 3 years now, and have known each other for 4. Since I'm a Junior, I've pretty much gotten about 18(?) months to somehow tell her. She's like my best friend and she's extremely important to me. It feels like I've known her more than friends I've been with since 6th grade. I dont know what to do, because I just don't. She's NOT dating anyone right now, so I'm clear there. Today was her birthday, but I couldn't get her anything, so I'm planning to getting her stuff tomorrow before school. I'll make my decision of telling her or not based on you guys. Thanks!
