VIPER: Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
MAVERICK: I know.
VIPER: VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
MAVERICK: I'm nothing like him.
VIPER: You may not think so, but you are.
MAVERICK: He was by the book, all the way.
VIPER: They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
MAVERICK: I never heard that.
VIPER: Not something they tell dependents.
MAVERICK: It's not true.
