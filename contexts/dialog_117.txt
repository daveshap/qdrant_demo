ISABEL: But without your brothers. Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies. You may explore the continent.
COLUMBUS: Thank you.
ISABEL: There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
COLUMBUS: Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things. I must see them with my own eyes. I cannot be other than I am.
ISABEL: I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
SANCHEZ: Then why?
ISABEL: Because he is not afraid of me.
SANCHEZ: All I have to do is call the guards.
COLUMBUS: Call them.
SANCHEZ: I am not afraid of you. You are nothing but a dreamer.
COLUMBUS: Look out of that window.
COLUMBUS: What do you see?
SANCHEZ: Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
COLUMBUS: All of them created by people like me.
