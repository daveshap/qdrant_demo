MCCLEOD: Corpses?
JENNIFER: Yes. We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
MCCLEOD: In the highlands?
JENNIFER: Yes. How did you know?
MCCLEOD: A lucky guess.
JENNIFER: I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
MCCLEOD: He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
JENNIFER: Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
MCCLEOD: You got me.
JENNIFER: Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
MCCLEOD: Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
JENNIFER: If it's good advice.
MCCLEOD: This is. Go home. Stay out of this.
JENNIFER: Why? What's going on?
