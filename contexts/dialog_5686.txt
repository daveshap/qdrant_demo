BRENT: You were eavesdropping.
JODY: No I wasn't.
BRENT: What did you hear?
JODY: Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
BRENT: Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
SANDY: You ok?
JODY: FINE. Are you?
SANDY: Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
JODY: What?
SANDY: Mark invited me to the party.
JODY: What party?
SANDY: Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
JODY: No.
SANDY: You can't tell your parents.
JODY: Ok.
SANDY: Especially not your dad.
JODY: I won't.
SANDY: It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
JODY: You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
SANDY: Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
JODY: Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
SANDY: I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
JODY: Stag?
SANDY: Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
JODY: I can't right now.
SANDY: Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
