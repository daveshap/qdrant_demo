MRS. MEREDITH: How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
LONGFELLOW: Of course they're going to stay. She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top? Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
CEDAR: Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
LONGFELLOW: Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
COBB: Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
LONGFELLOW: Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
CEDAR: Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
LONGFELLOW: Buffer?
COBB: Yeah. A glorified doormat.
CEDAR: Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
LONGFELLOW: Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
COBB: Why should you?
LONGFELLOW: Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
COBB: Nah.
LONGFELLOW: I've got one for Cobb—
LONGFELLOW: There once was a man named Cobb
COBB: Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
LONGFELLOW: Huh?
COBB: I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
LONGFELLOW: Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
COBB: Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
CEDAR: Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
LONGFELLOW: Who - me? No.
MRS. MEREDITH: No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
LONGFELLOW: Don't pay any attention to her.
MRS. MEREDITH: He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
LONGFELLOW: Now you keep out of this!
CEDAR: Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young. Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
LONGFELLOW: What for?
CEDAR: You're going to New York with us.
LONGFELLOW: When?
COBB: This afternoon - at four o'clock.
LONGFELLOW: I don't think we've got any suitcases.
MRS. MEREDITH: Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
LONGFELLOW: I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
CEDAR: I can understand that. We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock. Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later. Goodbye and thank you.
COBB: See you later, kid.
