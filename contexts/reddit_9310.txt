It took six months
Hoping this doesn't get deleted but I wanted to post somewhere it might be appreciated. 

My children have been working their little butts off and saving their pennies for months to buy a Nintendo switch. Today they finally have all the money, including tax. 
I just so proud of what they accomplished. I know others can afford to go buy these things for their kids, but I'm glad I at least taught mine how to avoid impulse purchases and save. 
Thanks for reading.
