SUSAN: How nice.
PAINE: All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
SUSAN: I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
JEFFERSON: Sure.
SUSAN: Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
PAINE: Chick--
MCGANN: I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
PAINE: Are you ready for him, Bill?
GRIFFITH: All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
PAINE: Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
GRIFFITH: Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
PAINE: Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
GRIFFITH: How do you feel, champ?
PAINE: All right, why?
GRIFFITH: Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
PAINE: Oh! Go away.
MCGANN: All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
JEFFERSON: Look! There it is!
MCGANN: What? Who?
