Pregnant teen girlfriend and her father
My girlfriend and I are both underage and she is currently pregnant with my child and we are trying to find a way to get out of this but it is looking more and more like we can’t, I am wondering however if we do decide to tell her dad would he be able to keep me out of the child’s life? Her dad severely dislikes me however I want to be in my child’s life and support him/her and my girlfriend.
