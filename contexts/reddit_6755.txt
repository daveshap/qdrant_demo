Would it be appropriate to contact the recruiter?
I was contacted by a recruiter from a major aeronautics company in mid-November about a position that both she and the hiring manager thought I would be a good match for. 

 Because it was right before the holidays I wasn't expecting to hear for a while, however, now that it's the New Year I want to email the recruiter to see where they are in the hiring process, would this be unprofessional? Did I wait too long?

Thanks in advance!
