MICHAEL: Things went badly in Palermo?
DON TOMMASSINO: The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen. Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
MICHAEL: Is that why there are more men on the walls?
DON TOMMASSINO: Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore. I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
MICHAEL: What is it?
DON TOMMASSINO: Bad news from America. Your brother, Santino. He has been killed.
MICHAEL: Get the car. I'll be leaving in ten minutes. Where's Calo?
FABRIZZIO: Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen. Is your wife coming with you?
MICHAEL: No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
