How does one duplicate tracks on both sides in KiCad? I have a problem: I'm making an Arduino shield that has tracks which are supposed to handle up to 10A (maximum, instantaneous) current (usually it's around 2A, but we want to be on the safe side.KiCad calculated the according tracks thickness as ~11mm, which is huge for an Arduino Uno shield. Therefore, it was suggested to me to have two tracks on both sides, ~5mm thick each. However, when I connect two nodes with the second track, the original track gets removed, even if I lock it. How can I get around this?
