NOLAN: This was my first classroom, John, did you know that? My first desk.
KEATING: I didn't know you taught.
NOLAN: English. Way before your time. It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you. I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom. I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
KEATING: Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
NOLAN: What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
KEATING: Courtyard?
NOLAN: Boys marching. Clapping in unison.
KEATING: Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point. About the evils of conformity.
NOLAN: John, the curriculum here is set. It's proven. It works. If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
KEATING: I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
NOLAN: At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John. Discipline. Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
