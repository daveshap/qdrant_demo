SPOCK: Permission to come aboard.
KIRK: Permission granted.
SPOCK: Thank you, Admiral.
KIRK: Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
SPOCK: It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire. I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
KIRK: Well, I... find that understandable I mean, you've been through a lot. Station, please.
BONES: You sure this is such a bright idea?
KIRK: What do you mean?
BONES: I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
KIRK: It'll come back to him.
BONES: Are you sure? That's what I thought.
KIRK: Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
