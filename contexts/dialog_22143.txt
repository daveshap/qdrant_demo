LUKE: Master Yoda, you can't die.
YODA: Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
LUKE: But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
YODA: No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
