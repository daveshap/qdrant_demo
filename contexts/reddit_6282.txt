Good news: I got a job! Bad news: I don’t have the job description and I’m too embarrassed to ask for it.
So, I’ve been interviewing left and right for a year and a half and today I got an offer that I accepted! Trouble is, I don’t actually know the literal job description.

I applied for the position in November, and got a call last month to come in and talk with a hiring manager. To prep I tried looking at the job posting, but they yanked it off of indeed before they arranged for me to come in. I tried everything I could think of: looking at reviews from old employees, looking at my application on their website, trying to find similar postings, and I got nada. I went in expecting to do horribly but it went great! Talked about salary, the guy showed me some projects he’s working on, and he basically told me I was a front runner right then and there. Didn’t really feel like a good move to ask “By the way, what’s the job description again?”, especially since every time I tried to get out of my second shift job for the past year has resulted in me eating shit.

I’m pretty confident that I know the *basics* about what I’m going to be doing (I’ve been working in my industry for five straight years plus 2.25 years in college), so I’m not worried that I’m under-qualified or that I can’t perform up to expectations. But I also know having a job description is important long term for salary negotiations and other things, and knowing what was in that posting would settle my anxiety about leaving my first full-time job for something new. I’m playing around with the idea of asking their HR to forward me the old posting for my records but I’m already at severe levels of George Costanza and don’t want to look like more of an idiot than I already am. Any advice?
