I think I'm finally ready. I've hurt too many people and I want it to stop. I'm a monster. I just want to keep everyone safe, but I'm covered in the blood of those I love. I know this will probably be ignored, but I just want to keep people safe. I want to finally eliminate the problem. the reason I'm posting here is because of a promise I made. But if this doesn't take...I think I'm ready. Normally I wouldn't say so much, but I don't know what else I could say. I've attempted suicide a few times and failed, and contemplated since i was very little, so I know I can do it right this time. I'm sorry that I'm like this.

If you read this, feel free to keep scrolling. Please don't be like me. I just want you to know that you are loved, you are valid, you deserve the space you take up, and your feelings matter. They are not something to ignore or be tossed away. You deserve to be heard. I love you and cherish you no matter who you are or where you are from or what you've been through. Please try to take care of yourself. Do the small things, even if you don't feel much like them. Take a walk, drink some tea, read a book, find peace in the rain, and smiles in the sunshine. Be careful where you let your mind trod, and please reach out if you need help. I love you, you are not alone in your feelings, and you can make it through this. Do not follow me, please, for I walk a lonely road. Please take care of yourself.
