how to set keyboard layout at login? ubuntu 17.10 Recently upgraded from 17.04 to 17.10 and I can't seem to find a way to set my keyboard layout at the new login screen. I have set the input method to dvorak within the settings>region+language option, and it works fine when logged in, but whenever I log out it defaults to qwerty and I have to bring up the on screen keyboard to input my password.Anyone know how to set this properly?
