CollegeBoard is the best organization ever. Here’s why.
I just want to show my enthusiasm for this amazing new sponsorship for A2C. Here are my top 7(I have to go to bed soon so I can’t list all 696 reasons) on why CollegeBoard is the absolute best thing to happen to us.

1: They are a nonprofit. We know as fact that the $80 registration fees for the SAT and AP tests are put to good use. And the $800 million they earn each year is of course used for scholarships and other wonderful causes.

2: They provide an excellent test to determine our readiness for college. Scoring a 1600 shows my superiority over someone with a meek 1580. The only reason I didn’t get into Harvard was because I only scored a 790 in the SAT Gender Studies Subject Test.

3: AP courses are the best way to prepare us for college. Who cares if taking 13 AP classes in one year damages us psychologically? At least we’ll be ready to thrive at SUNY Ithaca.

4: They are brilliant for introducing curves onto a standardized test to help all of us out. -30 for one question in Math is an awesome implementation.

5: They reuse tests to save money, which is used for all the wonderful causes I mentioned earlier.

6: When they accidentally screwed up the June 2018 SAT, they didn’t refund anybody. In fact, they didn’t even apologize. This shows that they were too busy working on fixing the issue that they didn’t even have time to refund or apologize.

7: It’s so wonderful that we get to send scores to colleges directly from collegeboard! And it’s free, too, if you decide to send it before you actually receive your scores.

So there it is! CollegeBoard is the best organization I have ever encountered in my 18 depressing years here on this planet. A true non-profit, and I can’t wait for the amazing things they will bring to r/ApplyingToCollege .
