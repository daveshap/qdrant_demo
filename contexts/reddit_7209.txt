Fear of being fired with in the 90 day probation period
Hello everyone... I’m kinda paranoid at the moment. I was getting fired from my job of 3 years because I got into a car accident and I was basically useless to them. Then I got hired at a new place at a Clinc and as a receptionist and I let the manager know that I know nothing about being a animal receptionist but I did have experience being a receptionist because of my old job , the manager told me that fine and that she would train me.. 3 weeks into the job I got fired because the manager didn’t want to train me anymore because she didn’t have time ( the manager has only been there for a month at the time) I figured out I was being fired because the manager was  training another girl to be the receptionist while I was sitting right next to them. Now this job I’m a receptionist at a Animal Hospital and I am terrified of getting fried from here , I told the manager that I had little to no experience being a Animal receptionist and she said that’s fine and that I will be trained.. I am currently in training and I’m getting the handle of things .. things have been looking good.. untill I went on linkined in and the manager job posted my job. I don’t under stand I thought I was doing ok.. it’s been a week now that the Job post is up.. I don’t know what to do.. should I look for another job? Should I calm down.. I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong! When I ask the manager if I’m doing good or ok she just replies to me like “you’re in training” “. I’m having a panic attack.. someone help.
