I'm trying to figure things out.
I'm trying to figure things out. This is the year I start applying to colleges. I've had it figured out that I want to apply for musical theatre and work towards becoming an actor. I don't want this to change. But I don't want to stop myself from doing things I enjoy just to try and further myself in a career. I want to have tattoos, and piercings, and dye my hair. I want to have full sleeves of tattoos but I don't want to be denied roles because airbrushing over tattoos isn't in the budget. I guess what I'm asking is, should I look for different career paths? Should I conform to what casting directors will be looking for? I just don't know what to do. It's a stupid issue and yet it's one I can't stop thinking about.
