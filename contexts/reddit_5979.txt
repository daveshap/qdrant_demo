BA Graduates: Who works in the field of which they studied in?
I graduated with a BA in Geography 2 years ago, but shortly after graduating i started working in Medical device sales and make around 70k (1.5 years in). My initial plan was to segue the job experience into something related to my studies but almost all well paying jobs related to Geography require a BS or engineering background.

My university friends who have the same degree either still work entry level jobs ( retail et cetera), got into unrelated private sector jobs like myself, or work fairly low wage hourly jobs related to geography ( Surveying, data entry, private school teachers ( that don't even necessarily require a degree) feelsbadman.jpg).

It seems like BA degrees on  their own are fairly useless to getting a lucrative career within the related fields of studies, and only useful to overcome most jobs barrier to entry requirements of having an undergrad degree. Ive seen a lot of other friends with BA degrees in Communications, psychology, Environment, English etc etc all either jump ship to something unrelated, get stuck in minimum wage retail jobs or stick it out with low wage jobs related.

Any success stories of BA graduates that got a dream job?
