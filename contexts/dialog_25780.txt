WORF: One of the dead Romulans had a tricorder. We analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.
RIKER: Trilithium?
WORF: An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
RIKER: Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
RIKER: Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
WORF: Aye, sir.
