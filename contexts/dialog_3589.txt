NADIA: What happened between you and the blonde?
JOHN: What?
NADIA: The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
JOHN: It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
NADIA: Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
JOHN: She's dead.
