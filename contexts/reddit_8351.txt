The opioid crisis: should it be a state of emergency and if so who should handle it?
The opioid commission wants Trump to declare a state of emergency, saying that having the President do so would bring intensity to the cause. Usually, drugs are not a cause for a state of emergency. Looking back in history, for biological reasons, it has been diseases that have caused states of emergency:

> It is not often that a public health emergency is declared for something other than a natural disaster. The US Department of Health and Human Services declared one in Puerto Rico last year after more than 10,000 Zika cases were reported there. Before that, the last emergency declaration, unrelated to a natural disaster, was during the 2009-10 flu season, when there was widespread concern over a potential pandemic.

From within the same source, it is stated:
> "Your declaration would empower your cabinet to take bold steps and would force Congress to focus on funding and empowering the Executive Branch even further to deal with this loss of life,"

But what else is a government supposed to do for a state of emergency?  It seems that it usually gives authorities more power, allows a rapid passing of laws, provide aid or equipment, and financial help, but these are usually for natural disasters.

The first source states that the commission wants: 
> [T]o rapidly increase treatment capacity for those who need substance abuse help; to establish and fund better access to medication-assisted treatment programs; and to make sure that health care providers are aware of the potential for misuse and abuse of prescription opioids by enhancing prevention efforts at medical and dental schools.

But should that be on the federal level or on the state level?

Are there other cases of a drug triggering a state of emergency either in the USA or in another country? If so, how was it handled? Was it effective?
