For those who were lost but found their calling. How did you figure it out?!
I'm in Social Media Marketing and I am so done with it. I hate it. But I don't know what I want to do next and I have been lost for a long time. It gives me anxiety at night.

My question is where did you start? How did you figure out which direction to go? How did you make the transition?
