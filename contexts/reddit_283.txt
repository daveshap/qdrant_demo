I need to win a war...
So, my friend and I are having a “lol war” we are basically trying to “get the last lol” meaning telling/texting/writing/other ways to make someone look at or hear lol, each other until the other caves and gets tired of “fighting”. It’s been going on for 2 weeks and I’m running out of creative ideas to say lol. Please help.
