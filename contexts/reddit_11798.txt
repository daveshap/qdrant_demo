I don't talk or live with parents anymore, which I'm happy about, but now I feel especially lonely knowing I'm completely alone and unprepared for the world at 18.
The title says a little bit. I know I don't need anyone to be happy, but being alone without people caring on that level really does get sad sometimes. I live with a friend now who's family is awesome,  but I constantly feel distanced from them and burdening them even if they insist they like having me. My parents were abusive drug addicts who now try to contact me weekly to ask me to come back, but I know the environment was toxic, and the monetary support wouldn't make up for the emotional trauma that comes with living with them. Only recently has it bothered me after 3 months of being out of their house, and after being so happy, I'm now more often in a bad mood,  bringing others down. I don't really know if there's a way to fix this, it just brings makes me sad a lot of times I guess.
