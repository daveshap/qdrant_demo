HAN: What are you telling them?
THREEPIO: Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
HAN: Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
THREEPIO: I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
HAN: Proper?!
THREEPIO: It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
