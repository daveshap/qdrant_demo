Is it unprofessional to have long hair in the work place?
Iâ€™m starting at a new place on Monday & was wondering. I have long hair, Iâ€™m a female. Itâ€™s past my breast area & when I straighten it itâ€™s even longer. People have told me I should tie it up. But Iâ€™m thinking if I should get a trim atleast to my shoulder area so I can be professional while still wearing my hair down. 

My workplace is pretty casual. But of course we canâ€™t have anything too out there (funny hair colors, too many tattoos). Iâ€™m sure they donâ€™t care about my piercings. But this hair thing bothers me & I was thinking with my first paycheck I should get a hair cut. 

Thanks ðŸ˜Š
