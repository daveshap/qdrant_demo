WADE: I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
HAND: It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
WADE: I plan to. Soon.
HAND: How soon?
WADE: This spring.
HAND: Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
WADE: It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
HAND: No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
WADE: Yes.
HAND: Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
WADE: Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
HAND: Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
WADE: Oh.
HAND: You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
WADE: Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter. I'll send you the five hundred.
WADE: Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
LARIVIERE: You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
WADE: On what you pay me?
LARIVIERE: Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
