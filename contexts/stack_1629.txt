Can I use MCP23008 with G6K-2F-Y relay? From specs of MCP23008: Maximum output current sunk by any output pin is 25 mA.Output High-Voltage is VDD-0.7, which is 4.3 V in my case.From specs of G6K-2F-Y:Rated current (mA) is 21.1 mAMust operate voltage (V) 80% of max, which is 4 V.Coil resistance (\u03a9) is 237 Ohm (measured actual is 245 Ohm).I am planning to use 1 relay connected from GPIO to GND.So my calculations gave me 18.1 mA using +4.3 V as described per datasheet which is more than 25% max current from the specs.Is it safe to use that design? If it is not is there anything else with 5V power supply and I2C interface?Updated schematic:I am planning to use internal pull-up resistor to keep p-channel mosfet closed.
