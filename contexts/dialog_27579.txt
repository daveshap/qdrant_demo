BONITA: You're going to live here permanently?
JOHANA: ... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
BONITA: He's shy, not like Enzo.
JOHANA: Yes. Not like Enzo.
BONITA: I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
JOHANA: ... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
BONITA: Are you going to keep it?
JOHANA: Yes.
BONITA: Does he know?
JOHANA: No.
BONITA: Maybe you should talk to him about it.
JOHANA: I can't... I just don't know how to...
JOHANA: I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night. You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods. Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan You're going to be a father
BONITA: But your man isn't quite a God!
JOHANA: Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
BONITA: Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
JOHANA: And you...? Do you love Enzo?
BONITA: Very much, I think. But, there's going to be a problem.
