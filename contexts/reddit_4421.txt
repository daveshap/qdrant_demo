What advise do you have for someone who is not functional anymore?
I break down into tears every day. I get almost nothing done every day. I am doing nothing with my life and I cant make myself care enough to try to make it better. I get to the end of every day and realise yet again i have achieved nothing of substance.
The worst part is going to sleep though. I feel even worse laying in bed at the end of the day.

Someone spent about 24 hours with me recently and i am embarrassed to let them see that this is the way I am living. 

My vague motivations to do something might last a couple of hours or day but nothing ever comes to a worthwhile fruitition. So i spend yet antlother week where all i do is surf the internet and tidy the house. 

I'm really scared because I am so close to giving up and i reallt dont see any of the rewards of making the effort to be worthwhile. And im so ashamed that this is the way i have been lovong for so long.
