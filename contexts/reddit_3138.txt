How do you know if you're happy with a job? Is the grass greener on the other side?
I have a well paid job for the LCOL area I'm in, and I like living here. My job is overall pretty comfortable with a ton of autonomy (maybe too much) and I pretty much have my systems in place. Some days I feel like I could make a good living by working here forever. Other days, there are some people I have to work with who I really don't like and they bum me out. 

How do I know when I'm happy? The alternative I face is to move out of the area for a job aligned with my skills in a more populated area. Or, I could stay where I am and find a job I could do and take a pay cut. 

How do I weigh the stressors in my current job with the potential stressors in another job? In other words, how do I evaluate whether the grass is really greener elsewhere? Is there some framework for thinking about stressors that will help me weight them in importance?
