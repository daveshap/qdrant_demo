Should I follow-up with the company (again) or let them reach out to me?
So I had a job interview the second week of March. It was my personal best interview ever, and I got really good vibes from the people I interviewed with. The company had posted a handful of positions and were looking to get a few new hands on deck. 

Unfortunately, that was right before the COVID situation blew up here. I followed up at the end of March to check in, and they said that they were going to pause their hiring processes to transition their team to work from home and re-asses their client needs, but also said they would "be in touch when they knew more". They've also removed all their job postings from their website. Now that it's 1.5 months later and I still haven't heard back, I'm wondering if I should send an e-mail to let them know I'm still interested, or if I should just let them reach out to me when they're ready to do so (or if they've forgotten about me altogether)?

I've tried staying engaged with their posts on LinkedIn to keep my name in their mind, but who knows who runs their LI account. I want to appear interested - not as a pest or desperate, so if I do e-mail them, is there some kind of template that doesn't require a response back on their end?

Luckily I still have a job in all this, but I'm still hoping to keep moving forward with my career, and I'm still very excited about this company and opportunity. TIA!
