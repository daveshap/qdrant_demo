ADHARA: I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
VALENTINE: All your life. That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
VALENTINE: What's the matter?
ADHARA: Nothing. I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
VALENTINE: The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
ADHARA: Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
VALENTINE: I sure hope so.
