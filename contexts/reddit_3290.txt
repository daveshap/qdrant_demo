If I shit the bed on an interview question should I try to salvage it in a follow up email?
I just had an interview for an internal promotion. I’m well qualified, was encouraged to apply by my manager, and I think it went well except for this one question. But the one question.... was bad. I got flustered and left out important stuff, and I’m afraid I came across sounding disrespectful and insubordinate.

Is it okay to add to my answer as part of a thank you email? For example explain that in retrospect I didn’t address XYZ aspect, and wanted to clarify my response since it’s a critical part of the job?
