I lied to a girl I am crazy about and it caught up to me
So I began talking to this girl a few weeks ago and we hit it off like crazy. I had just gotten done with some sort of relationship that wasn't official right as we began hanging out. The girl I'm with now saw me texting the old girl and I told her it was just a friend. I only lied so I wouldn't scare her off because I knew from the moment we started talking that I would develop amazing feelings for her. Well she mentioned it last night and I told her straight up that I was just getting over the old girl but we were not together while I was texting her(which was mostly true). The girl that I like now flipped out and pretty much won't even talk to me. I am so bummed out that I want to puke and I have no idea how to make it right. She won't ever trust me again and I don't know if she'll ever like me as much as before. I am so upset and feel like I'm lost without her. I have no idea how to make it better and it is all my fault. She doesn't even believe me when I tell her how much she means to me. I am sick about it and I really don't know what to do/how to cope.

I know it isn't the usual heavy stuff that most people share here, but I really wanted to get it off my chest. Thank you for listening.
