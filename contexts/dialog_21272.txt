BETTY: I told you where I was.
GEORGE: All night?
BETTY: I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
GEORGE: I was in a bowling-alley.
GEORGE: Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
BETTY: I told you, George. I'm not going.
GEORGE: Sure you are.
BETTY: No I'm not.
BETTY: Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
GEORGE: It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
BETTY: I don't want to put on some make up ...
GEORGE: It goes away ... It'll go away.
BETTY: I don't want it to go away.
GEORGE: Okay--now you listen to me ... You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
BETTY: No I'm not sweetie.
