is it “normal” to stay in classes past your program end/graduation just to complete certificates?
sorry if the title is confusing. basically I’m a full time policy student in a 2 year program and am allowed 3 electives anywhere at the university, so I’m taking courses that will supplement my concentration in social justice/advocacy (social work, black studies, etc.). I had already sort of intended to get a graduate certificate in black studies simply bc 1. It’s 9 credits and could be done relatively quickly & 2. my undergrad was small and never had anything close to this academic range, so I’m leaping at the chance to finally learn. 

however, I also recently learned that there is a certificate program within *my* school aimed at policy students & training them in fundamental urban planning. this piqued my interest bc I am currently working with a transportation research center that has been known to hire grad students full time if they are good, and most of the students who came before me were on the planning side of things, not policy. I feel it couldn’t hurt to add it to my resume but I also don’t want to look wishy washy and like idk what I should do in life (I don’t fully but I don’t want to *look* like it)
