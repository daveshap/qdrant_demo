Conan-ish fantasy comic from late 80s to early 90s with scantily dressed main characters fighting skeletons in a cave/dungeon Read a comic from the library back in 1993-1994, probably from the late 80s/early 90s. Short story, colorized, likely anthology format.Story line along the veins of Conan with heroic male protagonist and a female companion on a quest. Both scantily dressed. Fighting enemies that included skeletons if I recall correctly. They were going through a cave/dungeon and spent the night enjoying each other's company.The drawings are more stylized, gritty, cleaner and less crowded with less dialogue compared to all the Conan comics I reviewed. Definitely more adult tilted themes and unlikely a Marvel publication. I suspect it was published in something similar to Heavy Metal (that said, I don't recall any nudity or anything along those lines, so less \"adult\" than what you could see there).It was probably an individual issue of something, rather than a collection; I recall it being rather worn out, hence the time range. This wasn't the only comics story in the publication. This particular story wasn't very long - probably around 10 pages. Unsure if it was serial story that continued, or something standalone.
