ALBERT: Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but -- -- but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit! So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101 -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah! We kept many things underground.
LUTHOR: One of them should've been you.
ALBERT: Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it. The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
LUTHOR: Got it? Otis?
OTIS: Sort of.
LUTHOR: Good enough for you. Now then -- -- tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
ALBERT: Me?
LUTHOR: Not you. You. Tell me again.
