43 Single Male
I've been single going on 13 years now, time flies, I was in a 9 year relationship prior to that and a 1 year relationship before that. I've never been on a real date, I just was either in the right place at the right time or a friend introduced me to someone and we hit it off. I no longer have a circle of friends and I feel like I'm going to be single forever. Never married, no kids, I read websites that say I'm a "red flag" guy because I've never been married. Honestly it isn't a commitment issue, I was committed in my last relationship and that was 9 years of my life. In this day and age I'm terrified of even approaching a woman. I have little to no confidence when it comes to women, I feel like I don't have anything to offer anyone. I'm not fat, I am missing some teeth but that is from a fear of dentists. I dunno, I'm just an honest guy making my way through life the hard way.

Thanks for reading.

Edit 1: Thanks to all the positive posts.

Edit 2: I get it, I need to get my teeth fixed, I've known for awhile. Thing is I had a traumatic experience with a dentist when I was younger and it isn't just as easy as "getting my teeth fixed". I'm terrified of the dentist.
