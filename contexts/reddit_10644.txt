Advice On What To Day When He Wakes Up
Im sitting next to my little bro, I'm 32 hes 16, in the ER after he took a bunch of my dad's pills last night. There are people who have od'd, in the other beds around us and they are moaning and screaming and my little bro is a shy scared kid that's also on the spectrum of autism just a bit. They are taking him to another hospital with a psych ward I guess and i want to know what advice do i give him to be prepared for what's coming? What do I say to him when he first wakes?

Update: Just want to say thanks for all the advice and suggestions, everyone of them helped and I am gonna do my best to help my little bro through this.
