IKE: I like it. This whole thing is pretty incredible. I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
MAGGIE: Maybe someday.

IKE: Well, I'm impressed. Absolutely incredible. I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
MAGGIE: What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
