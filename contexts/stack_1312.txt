What is the best board to install behind a glue up tub surround? I would think it would make sense to install a waterproof board like GoBoard or DensShield behind a fiberglass tub surround, but I can\u2019t find an adhesive that specifically states that it is compatible with these products. I\u2019m hesitant to use greenboard when for not much more money I can have a waterproof wall. Cement board is a pain to work with and liquid nails gets mixed reviews adhering to it.
