EDWARD: What is this place?
BEAMEN: The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
EDWARD: The poet? What ever happened to him?
BEAMEN: He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
EDWARD: No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm already running late.
