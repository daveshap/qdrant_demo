I'm really not ambitious, nor do I have much in the way of interests or skills. What should I do for a living?
Have you ever watched the movie Office Space? Main character in that is how I feel - I just don't want to do anything really. I don't care much for travelling the world, owning a business, starting a family or anything else like that. A small apartment on my own with video games, junk food and TV will do me.

Still, I have to have an income to support that (right now I'm working 10 hours a week at a small shop and burdening my parents by living at home). Question is, what's best for me? I really can't see a career I'm interested in. I won't learn to drive (I'm too anxious and slow paced). I can't do anything involving handling food and drink due to alopecia. Intelligence wise, I'm a fair bit below average. Above all else though, I'm lazy, to the point where suicide seems kinda preferable to working full time; like life's not worth a huge amount of effort to me. What should I do?
