International experience?
I am a first year grad student, literally am starting classes in two weeks, for student affairs. I am so excited to be in this field, I have an assistantship in my schools interfaith office. It combines my passion for religious literacy and student affairs, and I definitely would love to continue with it for my future, but realistically I know that I might not be able to find a position for it.

I have already been brainstorming about what I want to do for my practicums to ensure I have other stuff under my belt. I have to have two practicums and can do a third. But my question is has anyone done anything internationally? I am going to be looking into a housing practicum over the summer, probably through ACUHOi. Has anyone gotten an international housing internship, or know anyone who has? Would having international experience be good or make me stand out during the job search process?
