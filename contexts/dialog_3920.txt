ADAM: Oh, boy! A jacket!
CALVIN: Your mom made that all by herself.
ADAM: No kidding!
HELEN: No kidding. Who else would have done it?
CALVIN: And I made these!
ADAM: Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
CALVIN: Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
ADAM: These are really swell! I mean swell!
HELEN: What did you wish for, Adam?
CALVIN: If he tells, it won't come true!
HELEN: Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
CALVIN: Well, we did in my family!
