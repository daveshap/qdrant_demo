Standardized building materials across a Roman style empire I am working on an empire that exists in my world.  I want to know if it makes sense for said empire to standardize the materials they use for construction across the empire.In the heart of the empire important buildings are constructed using a particular local granite and the roofs are made of slate.  The remainder of the buildings are a wooden timber frame, floors are made of both granite and ceramic mosaics.  Details:Roman-esqe empire, similar in size and technologyThe furthest provinces are roughly 800 miles (strait line) away from the capital, travel miles would be further.Some provinces are on islands and others are accessible by land but it is impractical to ship large amounts of goods (mountains, distance, etc) to themTemples and major civic buildings would be made from these particular materialsFor the purpose of this question there is no limit to the quantities of the materialsThe timber frame can be made from any functionally appropriate wood and the ceramics can be made anywhereI want to know:Are there historic examples of a nation/empire standardizing with these types of materials for use in important buildings?Was it done only in parts of the empire or were there locations that could not be supported?What methods of transport were used to get the items to the building sites?
