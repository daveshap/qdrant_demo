TRAVIS: Wiz?
WIZARD: Yeah?
TRAVIS: Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
WIZARD: Yeah?
TRAVIS: I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
WIZARD: Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
TRAVIS: Well, I just, you know...
WIZARD: Things got ya down?
TRAVIS: Real down.
WIZARD: It happens.
TRAVIS: Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
WIZARD: The taxi life, you mean.
TRAVIS: Yeah.
WIZARD: I know.
TRAVIS: Like do anything, you know.
WIZARD: Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it. You see, that must be what I am.
WIZARD: Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
TRAVIS: That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
WIZARD: What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know? I don't even know what you're talking about.
TRAVIS: Neither do I, I guess.
WIZARD: You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
WIZARD: Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
WIZARD: Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right. I seen enough to know.
TRAVIS: Thanks.
TOM: Betsy, come over here a moment.
BETSY: What is it? I'm busy.
TOM: Just follow me.
