ELLIE: David --
DRUMLIN: Ellie.
ELLIE: Do you have a minute -- ?
DRUMLIN: Actually I'm running late --
ELLIE: It'll just take a moment.
ELLIE: David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
DRUMLIN: I don't understand.
ELLIE: I'm asking for your help, David. I want to go. They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist. As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
DRUMLIN: Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
ELLIE: What?
DRUMLIN: As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
ELLIE: You...
DRUMLIN: Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
