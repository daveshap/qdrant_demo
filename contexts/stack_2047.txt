Word for a naive proposal What is a formal noun that critically describes a proposal that has not been thought through and fails to consider challenge or consequences? e.g., \"Without explaining why your objective is difficult to achieve, and exploring its potential unintended consequences, the proposal is unconvincing, and comes across as a X.\"My research has not turned up any appropriate single word. All single words I've come across imply nothing about the quality of the proposal, e.g., plan, idea, scheme, project, program, manifesto, motion, proposition, suggestion, action point, submission, trial balloon
