GRACE: What's the matter?
JAKE: You didn't hear something?
GRACE: How could I? I was sleeping.
JAKE: There's someone in the house.
GRACE: I don't hear anything. You were dreaming. Or maybe the wind blew something over.
JAKE: The wind isn't blowing.
GRACE: Jake, what is that?
JAKE: What does it look like?
GRACE: When did you buy a gun?
GRACE: Oh my God, Jake, no. If it is someone they'll go away. Or call the police. Don't go out there.
JAKE: What are you afraid of? I'm the one's got the gun. Stay here.
GRACE: Jake. No. No!
