How to use Dynamic Regression models in R to forecast future sales I want to forecast the sales having 2 independent variables, x1 and x2. I want to choose between different combinations and lags, e.g:sales ~ x1sales ~ lag(x1,-1)sales ~ lag(x1,-1) + lag(x2,-1)etc ...I use the function auto.arima(sales, xreg=c(x1,x2)) in R. My questions are:i) What is the best way to choose the most appropriate model for forecasting purposes?ii) I want to forecast sales, lets say, for the whole 2018. Do I have to separately forecast x1 and x2 and use these forecasts as inputs to the regression model? Is this the correct approach?Does this process of forecasting the predictors and then using the forecasts as inputs to the regression model have a specific name?
