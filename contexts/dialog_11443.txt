BEN: Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
MR. MCCLEERY: I want you out of here.
BEN: Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
MR. MCCLEERY: I am going to call the police now.
BEN: Could I make one phone call first?
MR. MCCLEERY: Get out!
