Customer couldn't afford $24 worth of pizza, made me really think about the costs of eating out.
little backstory - I'm an insurance agent by day, pizza guy 3-4x a week after work and weekends.

Last night I was working at the pizza joint, get a call, lady orders a pizza and wings, nothing fancy, I think around $24 total, she says she'll pay cash. It's in the oven cooking and I'm working on something else and the phone rings.

the caller ID shows me it's the same lady who's order is in the oven.

* me - \[pizza chain\] this is \[me\] how can I help you?
* lady - yes this is \[delivery address\] I just placed an order, but I don't have the cash to pay for it.
* me - oh I'm sorry, looks like it's in the oven so my driver isn't out there yet, what would you like to do?
* lady - I think my credit card has enough to cover it, here -
* *enters credit card info, declined*
* me - sorry ma'am, it was denied, it doesn't tell me why
* lady - oh, okay try this one - 
* *second credit card entered, denied also*
* me - sorry ma'am, same thing.
* lady - okay well I'm gonna have to cancel my order.

When I hung up the phone I just felt so bad for this lady. Unable to buy $25 worth of food for dinner tonight, credit cards seemingly maxed out, and less cash than she thought she had.

I spent the rest of my shift thinking about what I'd do with $24 if it's all I had for food. I work this job for extra cash and to help pay off my student loans, but things like that really hit home for me. I hope she didn't go hungry last night.
