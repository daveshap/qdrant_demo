Prevent closing of entire Xcode window on Command-W when \"Quick Open\" menu is open I have an Xcode window open with many tabs. I want to open a file through Quick Open (\u21e7\u2318O).When I decide to close the Quick Open menu and also close the current tab that I'm on, I'll press Esc to close the Quick Open menu, and then press \u2318W to close the tab. However, sometimes I make a mistake and press \u2318W on the Quick Open menu, which causes the entire Xcode window to close instead.Is it possible to prevent this behaviour? Maybe prevent \u2318W from doing anything when Quick Open is open?
