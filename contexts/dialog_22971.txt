CINDY: You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
BUDDY: Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
CINDY: That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
BUDDY: Then what kinda stuff can we do?
CINDY: Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
BUDDY: It sounds gay, but guess since you're a girl it's okay, huh?
CINDY: Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
BUDDY: Sure. We can practice talking.
CINDY: Okay.
