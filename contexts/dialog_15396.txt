KATHY: Peter, you have to admit--
PETER: --admit what? That I was right about you in the steam room? That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want? Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
KATHY: Peter...
PETER: How could you think that, Kathy? How could you even consider it?
