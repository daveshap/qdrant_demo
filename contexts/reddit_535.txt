Feeling Trapped in my house and Life
I am 18. I live with my mother, my step father and my baby brother (5 years old). I absolutely have no relationship with anyone in my house. I play and talk to my brother sometimes when we aren't disagreeing but i HATE my mother and her disgusting husband. I am not ever able to leave my house (babysitting and my family is downright broke plus i have no friends) and for weeks at a time i have no communication with the outside world. I dont have a phone (computer) and all i do all day is overthink , stare in space, take care of my brother like he is MY child and wish i could somehow end it all. I FEEL SO TRAPPED in the house as if the walls are caving in on me everyday. Im loosing my mind. I am going to college soon hours away from home . It is my only hope to get away from my suffocating household
