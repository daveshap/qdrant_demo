CLAUDIA: How wonderful!
CORRADO: That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
CLAUDIA: I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
CORRADO: More so than the shark?
CLAUDIA: There's no comparison.
CORRADO: Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
ANNA: Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
SANDRO: You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
ANNA: A little more so this time.
SANDRO: So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
ANNA: But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
SANDRO: There will be plenty of time to talk about it later. We'll get married soon. That way we'll have more time...
ANNA: In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
SANDRO: But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
ANNA: No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
SANDRO: But you just said that a month was too...
ANNA: I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
SANDRO: And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
ANNA: There you go... Must you always spoil everything!
GIULIA: Looks like the weather is changing.
CORRADO: Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
