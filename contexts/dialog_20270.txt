FAITH: You...
LEONARD: Hi there...
FAITH: Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
LEONARD: It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it? I knew that was too much.
FAITH: No, you gave a very convincing performance. And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
LEONARD: My picture's up?
FAITH: Congratulations.
LEONARD: Thanks.
FAITH: So, this is what you do? I mean when you're not playing other parts?
LEONARD: I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
