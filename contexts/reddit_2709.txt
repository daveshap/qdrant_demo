How can I be so driven at work but so lazy in my personal life?
I have been crushing it at work (raise after raise along with a huge promotion), but can't help but notice how lazy I am in my personal life. For example, my car is a mess, I put off doing basic things around my house (toilets and pipes still need fixing), will procrastinate until the very last minute for pretty important stuff.

How do you all handle progressing at work while keeping up a good home life?
