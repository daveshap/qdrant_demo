A Troubling Trend I've Noticed on this Subreddit
In the past few weeks, I've noticed a common response to "I have trouble saving" or "I have trouble meal planning" is the Ramsey quote (I'm paraphrasing) "Children do what feels good, adults are responsible."

Some commenters say things like "You have no self control"; "You don't understand the difference between a need and a want" and other variations on "You're immature and ignorant about the world."

How is that helpful?  

Maybe I'm just an immature child but it took me a few years to get really good at saving.  Self control and self denial are like muscles, they're built up over time.

Not everyone is taught how to budget at home, not everyone is resourceful enough to figure it out on their own.  

I don't agree with choices a lot of people make on here, but at least they're trying to improve their situation by coming here and asking for advice.  

Maybe this in inappropriate, but this doesn't seem like the subreddit for "tough love."

OK rant over.
