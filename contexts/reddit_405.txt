Neighbor wars
I am a college student with horrible neighbors. There was literally one single occasion where I said “can you please stop yelling” when they were screaming in the hallway at night and since then, it has been war. They have taped pictures on our windows, put water outside our door, banged on our door at almost midnight, kicked our door, etc. Their favorite thing to do is slam their door so hard it shakes our kitchen. My roommates and I are at a loss for what to do so we need HELP.
