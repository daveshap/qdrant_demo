TONY: This time I really don't see anyone man.
MARK: Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them. They begin walking around the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman. They give each other looks of disgust and continue on. The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms. The four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim. MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it. On the staircase is a zombie-fied creature. We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth. Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
TONY: This. is killer.
