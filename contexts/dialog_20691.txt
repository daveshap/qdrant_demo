LOUIS: My God!
RACHEL: It's beautiful!
JUD: You folks ready to go on?
LOUIS: Sure.
ELLIE: But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
JUD: You'll see soon enough, hon.
LOUIS: Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
JUD: Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
LOUIS: Not yet...how much further is it?
JUD: Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
