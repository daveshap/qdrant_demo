JEFFREY: Please, sir.
CHANCE: I've never ridden in an automobile.
JEFFREY: I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
CHANCE: ... Yes. You can take me.
JEFFREY: Very good.
CHANCE: ... My suitcase.
JEFFREY: Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
EVE: I hope you're comfortable.
CHANCE: Yes. I am.
EVE: These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
CHANCE: Yes. He's a very careful driver.
EVE: ... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
CHANCE: It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
EVE: I see. ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
CHANCE: Your family doctor?
EVE: Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
CHANCE: I agree.
EVE: Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you... David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
