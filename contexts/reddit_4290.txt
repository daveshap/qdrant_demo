How can you say you like someone if you only hang out once a week
I’ve been seeing this guy for almost 4 months. And he is super fun but he is horrible at texting. Literally maybe once every second day. 

Anyway last weekend he told me he liked me. But I think he only said it because he was drunk? 

I’m just entirely confused. How can you like someone if you only see them once a week and text them twice? 

How can someone be so busy to not text more. I see it as though, if he doesn’t text he isn’t interested. Talking to someone should be exciting and not a chore. 

Should I let him go?

I’ve talked to him about it and I said he shouldn’t change for anyone and if I don’t like it it doesn’t mean he should change. 

I’m just so confused.
