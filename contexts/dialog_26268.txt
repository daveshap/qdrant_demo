GILLIS: Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
BETTY: The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
GILLIS: I had a teacher like that once.
BETTY: Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving. Now why don't you use that character...
GILLIS: Who wants true? Who wants moving?
BETTY: Drop that attitude. Here's some- thing really worth while.
GILLIS: Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
BETTY: I'm serious. I've got a few ideas.
GILLIS: I've got some ideas myself. One of them being this is New Year's Eve. How about living it up a little?
BETTY: As for instance?
GILLIS: Well....
BETTY: We could make some paper boats and have a regatta. Or should we just turn on the shower?
GILLIS: How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
BETTY: Are you hungry?
GILLIS: Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle. I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
BETTY: Phillip, you're mad!
