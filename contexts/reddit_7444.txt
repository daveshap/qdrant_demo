For those who are in doctoral programs: was there hesitation/fear or just excitement?
I'm currently debating a really big decision. Funding only came from my last choice school which is still amazing and I'm incredibly thankful I got any offers at all but instead of feeling excitement (I have that a bit), I feel fear and dread.

The program is the best (I do medieval history) in the state system that I am in. The professor I had a zoom meeting with yesterday seemed nice and I have a friend that goes there for similar interests who seems to tolerate it but says it is a ghost town. This university is in a place that is smaller and more isolated than my current city but is only 2 1/2 hours from where I live now and an easy drive. There is no social life there (not that I'm into partying and am aware I'll be extremely busy but I would like to have options) and the one time I visited it seemed gloomy and meh.

I have been told by every professor and friend that I'm a fucking idiot for questioning this and I need to just go in and do this program even if it is 4-5 years of my life in a place I don't want to live. They keep saying the job market will be shit because of this pandemic so at least this is guaranteed income which will provide enough for rent and food. Many are also saying that grad admissions will be flooded next year so don't bother reapplying. It is now or never.

I hate all of this. I expected to be more excited. Did anyone else face a similar situation? Did anyone regret their decision to move somewhere? Am I crazy? Should I just bite the bullet or get a job and reapply to schools in more desirable destinations next year?

All thoughts and comments are appreciated. Sorry if this was rambling and confusing. I got a lot on my mind.
