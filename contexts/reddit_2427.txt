Is the grass really not greener on the other side?
I've been a trucker since I left school 10 years ago. Every post I come across are full of people dreading the office culture, politics, environment etc and saying how they'd love to be outdoors.

I work outdoors and it's shit, -5°C in winter and 40+°C in summer. Slogging 12-15 hour days behind the wheel, micro-sleeping and hallucinating just to make delivery times. Getting filthy and soaking wet when working outside.

The idea of being in a nice cooled office, not having to put my life on the line and actually working on a project with a team sounds so stimulating to me instead of being a monkey behind a wheel. But then I see so many people call themselves monkeys in other professions and hate the office.

What is one to do then?
