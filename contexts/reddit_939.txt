Can someone wish me a happy birthday?
I don't really have any friends in school or in general because I'm very anxious and socially awkward so therefore nobody wished me a happy birthday today, so I was wondering could anyone wish me a happy birthday here, it would be really appreciated!

Thanks.

Update: I went bowling and had a nice day in the end, everyone's kind words, support and advice really made it a lot brighter! Thanks to everyone!
