I get paid to do nothing. Should i stay at my job?
Hello everyone, for the last year I have been working as a lifeguard at a seldom used indoor pool that is poorly maintained. I spend my shifts sitting in a chair doing homework or other things to keep myself occupied. Naturally this is a very boring job. I would quit and get another job but I can not find a part time job for a high schooler that pays as well as this. Any advice?

Edit: Big thanks for everyones input!!
