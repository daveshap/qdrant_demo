PICARD: Beverly, come in.
BEVERLY: You're working late.
PICARD: Remember him?
BEVERLY: He was a bit proud as I recall.
PICARD: He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
BEVERLY: He turned out all right.
PICARD: I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
BEVERLY: Is he very much like you were?
PICARD: Yes.
DATA: Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
PICARD: On my way.
BEVERLY: Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
PICARD: I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
