MR. OWETT: Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
VADA: Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
MR. OWETT: You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
VADA: Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
MR. OWETT: I'm sure she did.
KEVIN: Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
VADA: But I wanna write about her.
KEVIN: You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
VADA: No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
JUDY: Then what did she do?
VADA: Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
KEVIN: Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
VADA: No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
KEVIN: All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
VADA: That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
JUDY: So she had you in jail, in Russia?
VADA: Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
