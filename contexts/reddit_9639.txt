Non student facing roles
Hello! I am in the second year of a HEA MS program and Iâ€™m starting to think about post grad options. I started the program wanting specifically to do study abroad programs. This is still very much my focus area. I completed an internship in international student services that I also very much enjoyed. However recently I have been thinking that a non student facing role might fit me better. I care about the students obviously but I am much more task oriented than people oriented so I think I could do better work as a behind the scenes person. 

Anyone know of any roles that are non student facing but still focus on study abroad/international students?
