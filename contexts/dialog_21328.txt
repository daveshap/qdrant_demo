UTAH: Well, I saw you and--
WOMAN: Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem. Right?! Well you figured wrong, dork!
UTAH: Hey! Uh, how do I get back in?
WOMAN: Carefully, tough guy. Very carefully.
UTAH: My name's Johnny Utah!
WOMAN: Who cares!
UTAH: I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
UTAH: Bye.
WOMAN: Wait! Jesus Christ! You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks. Here, follow me.
