PRINCIPAL: Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
LINDA: Why, yes.
PRINCIPAL: Jimmy's father is on the phone. I wonder if you'd take the call.
LINDA: All right. I'll be right back.
LINDA: Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
DAD'S VOICE: I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
LINDA: Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
DAD'S VOICE: May I ask why?
LINDA: We were having a little talk.
DAD'S VOICE: About what?
LINDA: Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
DAD'S VOICE: I don't know what he's told you -- What <u>has</u> he told you? Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
LINDA: Mr. Gardner, I --
DAD'S VOICE: You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
LINDA: Mr. Gardner, I don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
DAD'S VOICE: I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us. Keep him in your office until we arrive.
LINDA: Of course.
DAD: We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
LINDA: Yes, Mr. Gardner.
