LOUISE: Shit!
THELMA: Did you see that guy?! He was right in the middle of the road!
LOUISE: Shit!
THELMA: What?!
LOUISE: What?! What d'you think?!
THELMA: Oh.
LOUISE: We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
THELMA: Why?
LOUISE: They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
THELMA: I know this whole thing was my fault. I know it is.
LOUISE: There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
THELMA: Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
LOUISE: You're crazy.
THELMA: You're a good friend.
LOUISE: You too, sweetie, the best.
THELMA: I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
LOUISE: No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
THELMA: I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
LOUISE: Unbearable, I'd imagine.
THELMA: I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
LOUISE: How do you stay so positive?
THELMA: Louise!
LOUISE: What?!
THELMA: What in the hell is that up there?
LOUISE: Where?!
THELMA: Way up ahead!
