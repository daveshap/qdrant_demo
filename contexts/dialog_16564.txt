BARNARD: Not even a radio?
CHANG: It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
GEORGE: In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
CHANG: Are you so certain you are away from it?
GEORGE: As far away as I ever want to be.
CHANG: Oh, dear.
LOVETT: Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
CHANG: I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
LOVETT: No porters here!!
CHANG: No.
BARNARD: What about those men we met this morning?
CHANG: Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
