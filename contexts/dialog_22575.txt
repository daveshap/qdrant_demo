CARTER: -- what the hell is that?
LEE: What?
CARTER: That silly-ass look on your face.
LEE: I was being polite.
CARTER: Well don't do that. Polite don't work here. You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
CARTER: Where were we?
LEE: Witnesses.
CARTER: Wait. You hungry? You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right? Then you gotta be hungry. Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry. We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
