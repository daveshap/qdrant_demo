QUAID: Harry, what the hell is this?
HARRY: Come on, let's go have that drink.
QUAID: What the fuck did I do wrong?! Tell me!
HARRY: You blabbed, Quaid! You blabbed about Mars!
QUAID: Are you crazy?! I don't know anything about Mars.
HARRY: You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
QUAID: Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
HARRY: Unh-uh, pal. You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
