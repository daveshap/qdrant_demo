Should I keep my job as a permalancer for $34/hour (Fortune 500 company) or accept a full time job for $70k (startup)?
UPDATE: I spoke with my current employer and if seems he won't know until early 2019 if he could add headcount. As it currently stands, he cannot, but he only sees the company and team growing in upcoming years.

Hi Reddit,

Going through a small dilemma here. I was recently offered a position at a startup. I'm currently working as a freelancer at a fortune 500 company.

Some details:
My current position pays me $34/hour. Full time annually that would be $65,280 assuming I work every day. I don't. Even though Im "permalancing" of course that means I dont get paid for holidays (such as this week, I have the full week off). I currently dont have health insurance (missed the window where I can sign up) nor do I have a 401k contribution.

The startup offered me a full time position for $70k annually including benefits. This includes insurance, paid time off, 401k contributions, commuter benefits, stipend for health-related costs ($400/year), free meals at work, and cooking classes.

Question is, should I move forward and accept or try to get a full time offer at my current company? I have only been at my current company for a little over a year, and I'm pretty sure the only reason I was considered and offered the position at the startup was because my current company is so well-known.

Any help/guidance would be truly appreciated.

Thanks.
