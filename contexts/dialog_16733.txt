RUIZ: Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
LEO: We're square.
RUIZ: Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
LEO: Thanks.
RUIZ: You rode?
HORRACE: Yeah.
RUIZ: Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa. Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
RICKY: Where's Spa.
HORRACE: Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
