Word for \"no longer dry\" In response to someone elsewhere eggcoining the phrase \"whet one's whistle,\" I just found myself wanting to write that<blockquote>  An appetite is whetted until it is sharp; but a whistle is wetted until it is ____.</blockquote>I feel like the word-to-go-in-the-blank is right on the tip of my tongue, but I can't quite place it.What is it that a sip of water does to one's lips, either as a verb or as an adjective?a whistle is wetted until it is damp?a whistle is wetted until it is moist?a whistle is wetted until it is moistened?a whistle is wetted until it is satiated?a whistle is wetted until it is quenched?a whistle is wetted until it is wet?a whistle is wetted until it is wetted?I disqualify the last two on the grounds of tautology: \"wetted until it is wet\" doesn't work for me.Besides not sounding quite right to the ear, neither \"satiated\" nor \"quenched\" works semantically \u2014 if you merely wet your whistle, you don't go all the way toward quenching your thirst.\"Damp\" and \"moist\" both kinda work, but neither is very pleasant.Is there a word for essentially \"no longer bone-dry\" that I'm missing?
