BEN: Thank you very much, sir.
MR. ROBINSON: Ben -- how old are you now?
BEN: Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
MR. ROBINSON: That's a hell of a good age to be.
BEN: Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON: I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
BEN: Sir?
MR. ROBINSON: You'll never be young again.
BEN: I know.
MR. ROBINSON: Ben, can I say something to you?
BEN: What?
MR. ROBINSON: How long have we known each other now?
MR. ROBINSON: How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
BEN: Quite a while.
MR. ROBINSON: I've watched you grow up, Ben.
BEN: Yes, sir.
MR. ROBINSON: In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
BEN: Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON: So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
BEN: I'd like to hear it.
MR. ROBINSON: Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
