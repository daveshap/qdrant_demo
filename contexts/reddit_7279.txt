Is it better to earn a license/certification through an employer or yourself?
Let's say your employer is offering to help you get a certification or license but only for what they require with work assigned to you with that license or would it be better to earn it yourself on the side (taking classes, courses, etc.) on your own time so you can earn the kind you want to apply for the work you actually want later?
