BARBOSSA: My apologies, miss. As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
ELIZABETH: Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
BARBOSSA: There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates. What is it you want?
ELIZABETH: I want you to leave. And never come back.
BARBOSSA: I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request. Means 'No.'
ELIZABETH: Very well.
ELIZABETH: I'll drop it!
BARBOSSA: My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
ELIZABETH: Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
BARBOSSA: Did you, now?
