Any time I think about the future I'm overwhelmed with how much I don't want to be there
Basically title. Whenever I try to think about what's coming I get the sense of why bother staying alive. Growing old working a job I hate. Being alone all the time because I can't relate to people. I don't even want to look for a job because either I don't get the job and wasted my time, or I did and now I have to go work at something I hate or something I'm not good at. Either way I lose. Not only am I incredibly alone but I'm also incredibly bored. Nothing has excited me for a long time. Worst of all I don't see any of these facts changing regardless of what I do. At least making it to the end of college seemed doable but making another 50 years, 40 if I'm lucky? Fuck that man.
