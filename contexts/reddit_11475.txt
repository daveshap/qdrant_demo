I Feel So F****** Empty
Hey guys, i'm a 20 year old male who lives in Europe. To explain my problem to you, you'll need to know my weekly schedule. I'm still in school where i have many friends, I talk with a lot of people and am kinda funny guy in their opinion. After school I go swimming ( 4x week ), Where i am also not un-popular. This is during the week but in the week-ends I mostly do stuff with friends like go and do some fun stuff (paintball, karting, jumppark) or go out for a drink or just game with some friends till the early hours.

Everything in the previous sentences i find a lot of fun. But when i'm alone, or at home just behind my computer i feel so fucking empty. But the problem is I do a lot of stuff, for example today i went to help a friend with his new home. Helped him clean the place up, had a couple of drinks and laughed a lot, but when i got home the only thing i can think about is the time i get to do stuff again with friends or just go to school or swimming to do stuff.

Am i depressed i've asked myself? Why can't I get satisfied with the many things i do on my own time or just with friends?Some background info about me : I'm not an intro or extrovert. I can be really quiet with people i don't know or just talk the whole time. It's just like I feel like i'm missing out on some stuff. Doing too little and wanting to do more.

I really don't know why i act or feel like this and maybe some of you guys have had this too.
