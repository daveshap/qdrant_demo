What are the next steps after your offer is signed and background check is clear?
I signed my offer and cleared my background check. My background check however was finished right before Christmas. I tried to wait before I follow up with them giving itâ€™s the holiday season, but the job starts at the end of the month and I want to know when I should put in my 2 weeks for my current job. Can anyone fill me in on the next steps or maybe when I should follow back? Thank you.
