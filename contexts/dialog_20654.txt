MRS. KELCHER: Where have you been?
PEGGY: I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
MR. KELCHER: Damn that Charlie I
PEGGY: It's not Charlie. It's me.
MR. KELCHER: Peggy, let me ask you something. You're not... expecting are you?
PEGGY: At my age? Don't be silly.
MR. KELCHER: Thank God for that.
PEGGY: Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
MR. KELCHER: Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
PEGGY: Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
MR. KELCHER: All right. But this better be good.
PEGGY: I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
MR. KELCHER: Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
PEGGY: I think they're going to deregulate it.
MR. KELCHER: That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
PEGGY: Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
MR. KELCHER: I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
PEGGY: Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
MR. KELCHER: Evelyn, take her to her room!
MRS. KELCHER: I'm not the maid!
PEGGY: Way to go, Mom!
RICHARD: The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
PEGGY: I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
RICHARD: But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
PEGGY: I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
RICHARD: I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
PEGGY: Richard, take it easy.
RICHARD: No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
PEGGY: How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
RICHARD: I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
PEGGY: Give me some credit, will you?
RICHARD: Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
PEGGY: Wbat're you talking about?
RICHARD: Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty—fifty.
PEGGY: Sixty—forty.
