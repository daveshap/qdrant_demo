What do you call the professions that produce an end product and a material for the end product? Is there a separate technical term for professions that produce an end product and professions that produce a raw material?For example (let's simplify things):A miner produces copper. Copper cannot be used just like that - it needs to be processed, first.A guy who makes cables uses the copper from the miner to make a copper cable. The cable is now an end product that you can use right away.Is there a technical term for the type of profession the miner and the cable guy have that illustrates one makes raw material and the other a finished product?
