ENID: Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
REBECCA: We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
ENID: I know a party we could go to...
REBECCA: What? Where?!
ENID: It's a surprise.
REBECCA: I don't believe you.
ENID: If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
