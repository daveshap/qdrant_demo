Lost out on job opportunity b/c recruiter went on vacation. What lessons should I learn?
A seemingly perfect job came up that I am extremely well qualified for. A recruiter told me not to apply for it because she would put my resume directly into the hands of the decision-maker. I didn't hear anything for a couple of days, so I emailed her to check in. I got her out office: on vacation for over two weeks. Now the job is closed. And even tho the recruiter is back at work, I haven't heard from her.

What lessons should I walk away with here? I didn't apply because I heard employers hate getting a resume thru the normal application process that they also got from a recruiter. Next time, should I just apply? Do these things happen sometimes or should I quit working with this recruiter?
