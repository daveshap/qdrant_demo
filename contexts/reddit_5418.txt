Is the PMP or Six Sigma right for me?
I'm currently looking to change careers and have been thinking about up-skilling with a new certification and wanted some thoughts.  

I have a mixed professional background.  I was in the military, I have retail management experience, I have a BA in Mathematics and an MA in Economics, I was a Sales Manager for a large insurance company, and most recently have been a program manger for a large non-profit in my state.  Career-wise I have been utilized a lot as a fixer, someone that can come in to a bad situation and get things turned around quickly.

I have narrowed my search down to either pursuing a Six Sigma Black Belt or a PMP from PMI.  For anyone looking to know the difference, [here is an article pointing out them major differences.](https://www.villanovau.com/resources/six-sigma/difference-between-six-sigma-and-pmp-certification/#:~:text=A%20certified%20Six%20Sigma%20professional,project%20by%20a%20specific%20deadline) 

My question is, in the marketplace, does one have significant advantage over another?  I have a pretty broad range of industries and roles that I am looking at, but I enjoy the role of fixer/consultant, and want to prepare for director/c-suite positions in the future.  Both certifications look like they would be beneficial for me, so I was wondering if anyone had experience with either and how they are valued in the market.
