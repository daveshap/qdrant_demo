What does Vinculus mean about Strange and Norrell at the end? The ending was really complicated for those who didn\u2019t read the book I think!Can someone please explain this for me:<blockquote>  \"So?\" said Childermass, stung. \"That is not so very trifling, is it? Norrell is a clever man - and Strange another. They have their faults, as other men do, but their achievements are still remarkable. Make no mistake; I am John Uskglass's man. Or would be, if he were here. But you must admit that the restoration of English magic is their work, not his.\"  \"Their work!\" scoffed Vinculus. \"Theirs? Do you still not understand? They are the spell John Uskglass is doing. That is all they have ever been. And he is doing it now!\"</blockquote>This is really weird! What does Vinculus\u2019s sentence mean?
