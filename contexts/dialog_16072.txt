CLAUDE: Yeah.
YVETTE: My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
CLAUDE: She's alright, isn't she?
YVETTE: Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
CLAUDE: Why not?
YVETTE: She got married last month.
CLAUDE: Married?
YVETTE: Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
YVETTE: She always said that if you were on the outside...
CLAUDE: But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
YVETTE: I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
CLAUDE: Take care of me?
YVETTE: You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
CLAUDE: I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
YVETTE: Want me to come back some other time?
CLAUDE: Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
