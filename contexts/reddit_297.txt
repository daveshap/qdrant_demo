Should you hide bad grades?
Yes I’m Asian and our parents are very strict luckily, my parents aren’t that strict, but my mom will always be disappointed when I have bad grades. The other day the mail came home with a grade report of the entire year, and my mom knows about the mail, just not the fact is is my grade report, should I, or should I not tell my mother the truth about my grades, or hide it?
