I feel like I’m not good enough
I work out, I try to be nice, funny and charismatic with people but I feel weak and I feel like a pushover. I have a girlfriend but sometimes I get the feeling I’m not good enough, and I feel that if her and I break up it’s going to be hard to find another girl because I feel like every girl I talk to views me as a creep even though I’m never saying or doing anything inappropriate. If anything I try REALLY hard NOT to come off that way, to the point where I don’t even try. Sometimes I even feel like I don’t look good enough and I feel like I have to look a certain way just for people to like me. Whenever I ask someone for advice they tell me to be myself but I have no idea what that means because I’m already being myself. I have anxiety and I tend to overthink certain things. I feel like I have confidence issues because I find myself hating others who actually have confidence. I actually try to have confidence. If you need to be brutally honest with your advice, then go ahead.
