JAMES: Where's the car?
CATHERINE: Outside in the visitors, car park.
JAMES: What!? They brought the car here?
CATHERINE: My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
JAMES: Have you seen it?
CATHERINE: The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
JAMES: It's about time.
CATHERINE: It is?
JAMES: After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident.
