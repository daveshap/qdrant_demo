As a Young Professor, How Should I Deal With Disrespect From Older Professors?
I'm a professor in my twenties. I get confused for being a student despite dressing like a professional. For whatever reason, it seems like that allows older professors to speak disrespectfully to me in front of my students, whom I expect respect from. When they see co-workers disrespecting me, how are they supposed to have any respect for me? Twice in a row I've had other professors barge in my class and tell me to turn down the volume of the video clip we're watching because it was distracting their class next door. Yet both times, they refused to close their classroom doors and always blasted the volume to their videos so loud our classroom could hear it very clearly while I was instructing. My students remarked at the hypocrisy of the instructor to make such a request. 

Today I had an older professor come into my classroom that she normally uses and exclaim, "Who are YOU?" in front of my students during class. She was upset that I happened to be using a classroom that is "hers" yet college classrooms are like free real estate. They aren't designated to any one person. This is also the second time another professor has addressed me like that in front of my students. Her tone was irritated and upset, and I found that to be highly inappropriate. 

I honestly don't know how to address these issues. I'm very cordial and put on a smile and gladly answer, pretending as if I'm not miffed at all. But I don't feel I should be treated this way. What can I say to enforce my authority as a co-worker and prevent them from being rude to me in front of my students? Or should I just keep brushing it off?
