REGGIE: Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
DYLE: Reggie?
REGGIE: It's the only name I've got. How about you?
DYLE: No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
REGGIE: Why you lied to me.
DYLE: I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
REGGIE: Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
DYLE: But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
REGGIE: Carson Dyle is dead.
DYLE: Yes, he is. He was my brother.
REGGIE: Your --
DYLE: The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
REGGIE: How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it? Aren't you going to tell me? Hello -- ?
SCOBIE: If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
DYLE: You'll wreck your raincoat.
