I feel guilty for being depressed
Every single time i open my eyes and feel overweily empty like i have no reason to do anything i feel so much guilt about it. Like this whole stigma "you have x so you should not feel sad" hurts me a lot since i believe that. And when for the first time i felt like this is really gone, i found my own little happiness in life, there is no way i will feel like that again it just hit me again. When i set myself goal to not hurt myself because someone loves me at first i was like obvious to me, so easy, all i have to do to be kind to myself and now i wanna break down to tears. And the worst is that i don't wanna talk about it to someone important to me because again, i feel guilty for bothering them with my insignificant problems compared to them.  I know i should visit psychiatric about that but where i live it all goes down to "Oh so your parents are divorced therefore you miss your father. Give me 50$". Like... ???. Thank's i'm cured now. And i really do not want to fully open to complete stranger to me and tell my story in nutshell. I know this feeling comes and then goes away (and then comes back), i think i got most of it figured out. It's just later in years of my life it gets more sad and i can't believe i dare to think and feel like when got this and that.   
Thanks for letting me to rant here a bit. At least i got someplace to let my feelings out without getting worried i waste someone's time.
