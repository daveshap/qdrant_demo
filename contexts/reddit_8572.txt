John Bolton, North Korea, and the Trump White House's Successes and Failures
[In an exclusive interview](https://www.axios.com/bolton-john-trump-north-korea-missiles-94088bf9-4d2d-4d10-bfd9-80db7bc36a50.html), former U.S. National Security  Advisor John Bolton told Axios that the Trump Administration should admit its approach to end North Korea’s nuclear arms program has “failed.” Bolton suggested the Trump administration is "bluffing" about stopping North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and it would be “very unusual” for this White House to say that they were wrong.

John Bolton, though, is an interesting figure himself to say the least. Bloomberg, [in their piece on how Bolton's departure could impact the President's foreign policy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/john-bolton-trump-foreign-policy), described Bolton as "the most vocal hardliner [in] President Donald Trump's inner circle." Bolton's departure has also been met by favorable and affirmative statements from other government, [including that of North Korea](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-20/north-korea-praises-trump-for-ousting-troublemaker-bolton). Foreign Policy magazine went so far as to [analogize](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/01/john-bolton-is-ready-to-go-rogue/) the Trump-Bolton relationship with the tumultuous Reagan-Haig relationship of the 1980s. If that were the case, I'd imagine Mr. Bolton would love to criticize Mr. Trump regardless of how effectively the White House operates.

That being said, Kim Jong Un has been presenting himself to be very tough recently. Earlier this month [he inspected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/kim-jong-un-is-back-on-his-white-horse-as-north-korea-flags-a-big-decision/2019/12/03/7bbc9b2a-163c-11ea-80d6-d0ca7007273f_story.html) "revolutionary battle sites" around Mount Paektu, and [warned Washington](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korea-warns-united-states-of-an-unwelcome-christmas-gift/2019/12/03/ad406634-1599-11ea-80d6-d0ca7007273f_story.html) that it could soon receive an "unwelcome Christmas gift," calling us all back to remember [the last thing](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/05/asia/north-korea-missile-nuclear-gift/index.html) North Korea described as a "gift." I'm no deterrence theorist, but that seems a bit like bolstering reputation and interest.

So, what are we supposed to believe. Is John Bolton right in saying the Trump White House is failing in North Korea, or is John Bolton merely criticizing an ex-employer? More specifically, could you give me any insights on: 

 - **What successes (and failures) has the Trump Administration seen in its relations with North Korea;**
 - **Are those successes (and failures) significant compared to the successes of other Presidencies;**
 - **Can those successes be maintained (or those failures undone) by this Administration, or are they fleeting, and;** 
 - **Is it reasonable to believe that another specific strategy is definitively more likely to bring about more success (or less failure)?**
