IPhone 6 Cell antenna works intermittently I have an iPhone 6, and the cell antenna does not work at all, except right after it's re-assembled.I replaced the battery and it worked for about 15 minutes (I activated it and made a call).Batteries Plus changed the antenna and it did not work, then when they put the old antenna back in and put it back together it worked for a few minutes, similar to my experience.Is there any hope for this?  I have done at least 6 factory firmware resets with itunes, and am looking for any suggestions for other things to try.
