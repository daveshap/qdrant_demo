THEO: Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase. So I've taken on the task.
VOICE: Who are you?
THEO: Let me talk to the lady again.
VOICE: There's no lady here.
THEO: If you've already killed her that's fine. I'll keep the bonds and the cash. We got nothing to discuss.
VOICE: Hold on.
THEO: If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
VOICE: Let her tell you.
LENORE: Yes? Yes?
THEO: Hi Lenore. It's me. I got you back. Courtesy of Star 69. Are you hurt?
LENORE: They dragged me downstairs. I thought they were going to kill me.
THEO: Lucky for them they didn't.
LENORE: What did you do?
THEO: I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
LENORE: God, if he doesn't come back --
THEO: I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying. And I'm in a position to negotiate. What about your husband and your child?
LENORE: They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
MALE VOICE: Who are you working for?
THEO: I'm self employed. What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
MALE VOICE: Twenty percent.
THEO: Fine. I want half. Plus the release of the family.
MALE VOICE: Whatever you say.
THEO: You're making it too easy.
MALE VOICE: You got time on your side. Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
THEO: They saw you kill the driver.
MALE VOICE: You're up on your details, aren't you?
THEO: You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison. He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
MALE VOICE: Keep talking.
THEO: You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
MALE VOICE: There are no guarantees in this life.
THEO: Granted. But I don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures.
