FATHER: Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
JOHNNY: It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
MOTHER: Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
FATHER: Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
JOHNNY: Mr. Rasczak.
FATHER: Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
JOHNNY: No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
FATHER: Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
JOHNNY: I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
FATHER: Oh, is that how it is ?
MOTHER: Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
JOHNNY: Uh, no.
FATHER: A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
JOHNNY: Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
MOTHER: Good good, then it's all settled.
FATHER: A year at Harvard and you'll see this Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives."
JOHNNY: Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
FATHER: Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
JOHNNY: I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
MOTHER: Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
JOHNNY: Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
MOTHER: Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
FATHER: Teenagers !
