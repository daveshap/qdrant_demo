Converting media server to Ubuntu: Do I need to convert NTFS drives with movies? I'm a rookie in the Ubuntu world but want to learn.I have a media server running Windows 7: four physical drives containing movies. I want to convert the media server to a simple Ubuntu machine. The system drive is separate, so it's easy to change the operating system.My question is about the three other drives - they are NTFS. Is it OK to keep them like this? Do I need to convert them? They are almost full :) I guess I can back them up, one by one, to a temporary external drive if necessary...
