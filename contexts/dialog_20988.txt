ARGON: The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
NEBBLEMAN: Cleaned up? It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized! That's what we've been trying to tell you! The only thing we can do is run! Run! Run!
ARGON: Facts, Dr. Nebbleman. Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
NEBBLEMAN: Well, yes. The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
ARGON: Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
NEBBLEMAN: That might work.
ARGON: Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant. And we're going to need a containment crew.
POPPY: A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
ARGON: You're right. Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
