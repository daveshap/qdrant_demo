Failed high school... today I got accepted to UMich :)
In high school I was failing for a few reasons. The major reason was laziness and not being motivated, combined with being treated for EDS and anorexia. I had a wide mixture of A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, and F’s on my transcript.

I started community college last year (this year I’m a sophomore) and developed a new attitude and new study habits and have been going to therapy for over a year now. I currently have a 3.83 GPA (no ACT/SAT score necessary for transfers) and got more involved in campus life (becoming a statistics tutor after quitting the idea that “I suck at math” and I joined film club).

I applied to UMich as a reach last month and I heard back today!!! I GOT IN TO LSA!!!

After my senior year of high school I was super depressed, I thought I was worthless and suuuuuch an idiot. I am very grateful for where I am today. Go blue 💙💙💙

edit/update: They gave me no financial aid (I'm OOS) so it would cost like $70k+/year including finding an apartment off campus (they don't have transfer housing). So, I won't go, but still good news to hear overall!

AND r/chanceme told me multiple times that I wouldn't get accepted, so keep up the hope y'all.
