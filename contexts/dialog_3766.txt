BATTY: I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian. What do you think, Mary?
MARY: I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
BATTY: Pris?
BATTY: You're our best and only friend.
SEBASTIAN: Thank you.

DECKARD: Hmmm?
RACHAEL: Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
DECKARD: Don't be fooled by appearances.
RACHAEL: It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
