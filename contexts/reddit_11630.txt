I don't care what you think, getting drunk and listening to music is about the only thing I enjoy in life any more. Everything else just feels like nothing at all.
I remember being happy once. It was for a few years after high school. Everything in life was new and exciting. There was nothing but potential, nothing but promise of a future that could be anything I made of it. I was surrounded by friends, surrounded by a great girl who made me excited about life. We were young and dumb and all we did was enjoy ourselves. 

Now what do I have? Well I have debt. I have no post secondary education. I can't afford that right now. Friends? They've all moved away, some of them even have families of their own now. I'm almost 30 in a couple of years. Yeah, I'll slowly crawl my way up to a brighter future. Perhaps one day I'll feel better. Perhaps one day I'll feel excited again. Perhaps one day I won't feel alone. Perhaps one day I'll get better at making new friends. Maybe one day someone will truly understand me, how to love me. I don't know. I hope I make it to that day.

Beer after beer, song after song. I'm getting sleepy. Almost time to pass out. I'm smart enough to know that alcohol doesn't help these kind of situations, but this is the closest thing to feeling anything even remotely exciting. 

Sigh. Time is ticking. I've never much paid attention to the clock, although I always was terrifyingly aware of it's presence. I've wasted so many years. I can't afford to waste any more. I won't waste them any more. But I can't be certain I'll enjoy them. I can't be certain I'll bother with them. It's like my life is like a shift at a crappy job. I stare incessantly at the clock, just waiting for the day to end. 

I want to be happy, but I don't know how to be. I just don't understand it.


"Take me back before the years,
and memories are worn with time,
before the hour glass is drained,
before the colours start to fade..."
