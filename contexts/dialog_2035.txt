CAROL: Hi.
MELVIN: Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
CAROL: Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
SIMON: I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
MELVIN: Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
MELVIN: I was going to do that for you.
CAROL: It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
MELVIN: I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
CAROL: Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
SIMON: That's very thoughtful.
MELVIN: Never a break. Never.
