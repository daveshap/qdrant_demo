I did a presentation by myself !
My legs were shaking, my heart was pounding, I stumbled over my words and I felt like I was going to pass out but I did it! 

I stood up in front of my entire class and did my presentation all by myself and I feel so proud of myself !

Edit: Hello everyone!

I would just like to say that I am extremely grateful and appreciative of all the support I have gotten on this post !

I apologies that I havenâ€™t been able to reply to every comment but I genuinely hope that you all grow and overcome your struggles you may have!
