Business Management Graduate - Job Hunt
Hi there, 

I’ve recently graduated university with a 2:1 BSc. And a Distinction at MSc. Level, but I have had very lukewarm responses of “overqualified” or “you won’t be stimulated”. Which I suppose aren’t the worst things in the world, but I need to know how to improve. I have ten years solid full time work experience but I’m finding I can’t even get a basic office job. I have good feedback from my interview style, I’ve shown my CV and Letters to every man and his dog and I’m just not getting anywhere. I’m aware that I am the common denominator in the situation, so I know that I must change. Any advice from anyone who has been through this would be greatly appreciated, thank you.
