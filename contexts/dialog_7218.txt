GLORIA: Yeah! Don't you guys miss having girls here?
CHARLIE: Miss it? It drives us crazy. That's part of what this club is about. In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
NEIL: You what?! How did you do that?
CHARLIE: I'm one of the proofers. I slipped the article in.
PITTS: Oh God, it's over now!
CHARLIE: Why? Nobody knows who we are.
PITTS: Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?! Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is? Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
CHARLIE: It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
GLORIA: That's right, it's Nuwanda.
CHARLIE: And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say? If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
NEIL: You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie. You don't speak for the club.
CHARLIE: Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks? If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up. All your asses are safe. Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
