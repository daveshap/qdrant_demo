BETSY: Hello, Travis.
TRAVIS: Hello, Betsy.
TRAVIS: I see where Palantine got the nomination.
BETSY: Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
TRAVIS: Well, I hope he wins.
BETSY: How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
TRAVIS: Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up. A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
