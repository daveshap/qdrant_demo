My mom just told me that she's filing for divorce tomorrow.
My parents have had a very strained relationship for as long as I can remember. He has cheated many times and works a traveling job because the tension in the house is so high when he is here.
I live on campus at my university now and my mom just let me know over the phone that she's seeing an attorney tomorrow and filing. Even though I've wanted this for a long time, I still feel so upset. I'm the youngest child (I'm 18) and my siblings are supportive of a divorce as well, but this whole situation still feels so painful. I know that divorce is so common now but I don't know how I'm supposed to go to classes tomorrow and act like everything is okay.
