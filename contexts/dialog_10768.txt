STARLING: Finish your tour?
PATTERSON: And anxious to get started. What is this, mostly malaria?
STARLING: Yes- but their suffering is only transitory- once they except God into their hearts, He will vanquish all pain.
HAWTHORNE: I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, don't get sick in front of it." That was meant to be charming
STARLING: You never had it.
HAWTHORNE: Nigel and I don't like each other much.
SAMUEL: I am also liaison between these two.
PATTERSON: Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
HAWTHORNE: This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
PATTERSON: Then why do you stay?
HAWTHORNE: Who else would hire me? Beat you to it, didn't I? Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift.
