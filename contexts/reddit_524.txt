This guy wants my number but I don’t want to give it to him
So this guy (16 m) at my school gave me (15 f) this letter on Wednesday basically declaring his love for me but I had only known him for a couple of weeks and even then we didn’t talk that much. So I told him that I didn’t feel the same way and he said ok. Now he’s asking me for my number but I don’t want to give it to him. How do I explain that to him?
