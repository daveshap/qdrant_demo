EARL: How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
BOOTH: The horniest dog in Nevada.
EARL: Thanks for the loan, man. I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
BOOTH: Well I hope so. That pretty much cleaned me out.
EARL: I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
BOOTH: I hear you.
EARL: Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher. He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars! Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that? His excuse was the government got it all.
BOOTH: Seven thousand...
EARL: He would have won more but he blew it at the end. Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
BOOTH: Cash and what?
EARL: Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
BOOTH: Never heard of it.
EARL: Oh, you would have done great.
BOOTH: I probably would have. I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
EARL: That's what everyone thinks. But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
