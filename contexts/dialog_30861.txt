MICHAEL: Go back
AARON: Yes - and you have. Do you see...? He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
AARON: With his hands!
ROWAN: But why would they do that...?
