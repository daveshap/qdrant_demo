MARTY: That's all taken care of.
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
MARTY: Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
MARTY: That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
MARTY: That's just what I needed to hear.
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: It'll be fine, Marty. You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
MARTY: Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: There's no way of knowing.
MARTY: Perfect...
PROFESSOR EMMETT BROWN: It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
