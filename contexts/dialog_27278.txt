MULDER: Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
BYERS: You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
MULDER: They took her --
SKINNER: Agent Mulder --
MULDER: Where's Scully?!
SKINNER: She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
MULDER: Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
SKINNER: I know. Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
MULDER: How deep does this go?
SKINNER: I don't know.
MULDER: Are we being watched?
SKINNER: I'm not taking any chances.
MULDER: I need your clothes, Byers.
BYERS: Me?
SKINNER: What are you doing?
MULDER: I've got to find Scully.
