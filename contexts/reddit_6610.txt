Software Developer looking for tech companies offering sponsorship (E3 visa for Australian citizen)
Hi,

I'm a Software Developer many years of experience and I'm looking for a job opportunities in San Francisco.

I'm from Australia and am attempting to try get an E3 visa sponsorship. I know that all best big companies like Google, Facebook, etc. are offering this kind of visa, they also are pretty hard to get an offer from.

I wonder if there are other companies (if any) which will be willing to offer sponsorship? Basically all job offers I've found online contains this statement 'Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.' 

I was wondering if any San Francisco based recruiters would give me some general advice? Is this even possible to find employer who will offer sponsorship except those best known big companies?

I would appreciate any sort of help or general advice.
