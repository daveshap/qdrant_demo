WELLES: Uh huh, pleasure.
MRS CHRISTIAN: Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
LONGDALE: Yes, I do have something to say. I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
WELLES: I'm listening.
LONGDALE: As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
WELLES: Of what sort?
LONGDALE: You are a private investigator?
WELLES: That's right.
LONGDALE: Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
