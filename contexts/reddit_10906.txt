It’s impossible to talk about suicide
People don’t wanna hear about it. Suicide lines are bs. If you do open up to someone they suddenly become responsible for your well being which is a difficult position to be in for them. It’s also emotionally draining to listen to someone talk about it. I feel like a burden because being suicidal makes me one.
