windows and ubuntu on ssd, another ubuntu on hdd, cannot access second ubuntu please help me.On my pc i had a windows and an ubuntu (64-bit), installed on SSD. I needed a new (32-bit) ubuntu and i installed it on the HDD (a new 100GB partition, ext4 type).Now, when i start pc, it goes in the normal boot menu where i have the old windows and the ubuntu. I went on the boot setting and i tried to boot from all the options i found, with the hope to find the new ubuntu instaled, but i didn't find it. Can anybody tell me if there is a way to access the new ubuntu and add it in the boot menu near the old OSs?
