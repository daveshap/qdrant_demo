JOHN: I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
CYNTHIA: Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
JOHN: Right.
JOHN: I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
CYNTHIA: Why?
JOHN: I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
CYNTHIA: I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
JOHN: Who said I was jealous?
CYNTHIA: I did.
