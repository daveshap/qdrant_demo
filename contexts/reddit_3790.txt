Is it weird for a guy to sleep with stuffed animals and love them as if they were his own children?
I’m a 24 y/o working professional. I’m short but pretty muscular and have never dated before. What do girls think of guys with stuffed animals? I currently have a stuffed pig, two teddy bears, a moose, a rhinocerous, a penguin, and an elephant. They take up half my bed and I treat them like my own children. I have names for each of them, and pretend to be their father and cuddle them before bed each night. I also have a pillow that I humanize. The pillow is a picture of Ralph Wiggum (an animated little boy from the Simpsons who I think is adorable) and I pretend he is my own child and cuddle/kiss my pillow. Will women find this weird, and can I still maintain this habit? I’ve had these animals for as long as 20 years and don’t want to get rid of them, but I won’t mind storing them somewhere if my girlfriend or wife doesn’t want to share a bed with them
