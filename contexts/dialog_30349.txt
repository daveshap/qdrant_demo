SCOTTIE: Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
JUDY: Honest?
SCOTTIE: There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
JUDY: But Scottie, you don't have to!
SCOTTIE: I want to! Come on!
SCOTTIE: No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
SALESWOMAN: But you said grey, sir.
SCOTTIE: Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted.
JUDY: But I like that one, Scottie.
SCOTTIE: No, it's not right.
