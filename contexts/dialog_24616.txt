MIKE: But I got him! He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
GARBER: You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
MIKE: It wasn't a bad bust. He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
GARBER: Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
MIKE: Even Joey Venza?!
GARBER: He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move. We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved good will" by turning himself in."
MIKE: What about when she identifies him?!
GARBER: If she identifies him. Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy! Venza was meat. He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up! You better hope she identifies him.
T.J.: Wasn't your fault.
MIKE: It was my fault, T.J. Fuck!
ELLIE: The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore. What took you?
MIKE: Oh, some shit.
ELLIE: What shit, honey?
MIKE: You don't want to hear about it.
