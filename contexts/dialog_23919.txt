SHERIFF COBB: Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
STELLA: That was my plan.
SHERIFF COBB: Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
SHERIFF COBB: Kelly, get over here. You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you? Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
KELLY: Howdy.
SHERIFF COBB: Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
SHERIFF COBB: You got a place to stay?
PADEN: I just got to town.
SHERIFF COBB: Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
