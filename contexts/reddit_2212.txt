Did you apply to the ivies? Yes? Then you’re good.
According to this article from The Atlantic, there really isn’t a difference in career income between those who apply to the ivies and those who attend them (for most fields). If you’re smart and dedicated enough to reasonably apply to these schools, statistics show that those qualities will carry over to your college and future career regardless of your school choice.

What does all of this mean? It means that if you apply to the ivies/T20s, your intelligence and drive is reasonably likely to lead you to just as fulfilling and successful of a career as an ivy grad. So, if you’re smart and driven enough to apply, then your college career is expected to pan out amazingly. Don’t worry about it!
