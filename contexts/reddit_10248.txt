It’s a sad world when a 15 year old kid is contemplating suicide to escape his emotionally abusive parents.
I’m sick of being called “a fu*king animal” by the people who are supposed to raise me to be a productive adult. It’s years of emotional trauma brought up by their anger towards each other that they take out on me verbally. I don’t get help for any of my issues and they refuse to believe that I’m spiralling towards rock bottom.

 I thought since my friends couldn’t care less, my parents called me ungrateful a hotline just told me “life will be okay soon”, I’ll just open up to the two strangers here on reddit.
