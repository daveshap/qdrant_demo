RICK: Are any of those right?
MANAGER: This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
RICK: Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
MANAGER: It's on the tenth floor.
RICK: What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
MANAGER: Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
RICK: I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
