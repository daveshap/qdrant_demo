JACK: Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
DESMOND: Where's Hap?
JACK: He's dead -- good and dead.
DESMOND: Sorry to hear it.
JACK: He didn't suffer.
DESMOND: I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
JACK: Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
DESMOND: Any friends?
JACK: No.
DESMOND: Ever see her with someone else?
JACK: No.
DESMOND: Did she ever mention any friends?
JACK: No. Ask Irene over there.
