NICKY: Good luck.
PAMELA: You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
PAMELA: I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
NICKY: Am I a doctor, no, but...
PAMELA: Are you an expert in amnesia?
NICKY: Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
PAMELA: Believed what?
NICKY: I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
PAMELA: So he fooled you.
NICKY: If you say so.
PAMELA: Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story. Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
NICKY: You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
PAMELA: You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
NICKY: You mean, did I want a date?
PAMELA: Did you?
NICKY: These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
PAMELA: Some women like Dobermans --
NICKY: What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
PAMELA: See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
