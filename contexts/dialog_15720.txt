KRENDLER: You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
CLARICE: Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
KRENDLER: Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
CLARICE: I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
KRENDLER: Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
CLARICE: Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
KRENDLER: Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
KRENDLER: He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
CLARICE: Sir, doesn't this William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?"
KRENDLER: Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
CLARICE: Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
