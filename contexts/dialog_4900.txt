TOM: Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
AARON: Same old stuff. I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
TOM: You want to go out there -- get out of this for a second?
AARON: Why don't you lead? I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
TOM: What did I do to you?
AARON: You've made my dreams silly.
