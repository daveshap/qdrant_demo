TRAVIS: Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
PALANTINE: Yes I am.
TRAVIS: Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
PALANTINE: Why, thank you Travis.
TRAVIS: I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you. I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
PALANTINE: I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
