What does it mean for an 'electron wave' to have momentum? I'm studying quantum physics from MIT lectures and there's a concept that they alredy start with: momentum of a wave.Given the wave-particle duality, I can kinda imagine that momentum is possible to define, since the electron has mass and it's travelling somehow as a wave. So the only possible interpretation for momentum of a wave that I can think of is:By saing that a wave has momentum $p$ we're actually saying that an electron with mass $m$ will have velociy $v = m/p$ in that wave (since $p=mv$).Is my definition at least near of what it's supposed to mean?
