what should i say if my parents ask about my bruises?
i went out to the beach today with two of my guy friend and girl friends. we got a bit carried away and were play fighting most of the day, which resulted in me getting a lot of bruises (from the boys). they didn’t intend on hurting me and i don’t find it wrong in any way, but if my parents ask about the bruises i don’t know what to say. they’re very noticeable and i have quite a lot of them. if i tell them that the boys gave them to me, they’ll find it suspicious and will be cautious about me hanging out with them. does anyone have any cover up stories i could use or advice?
