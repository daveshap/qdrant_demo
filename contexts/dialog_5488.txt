LENORE: Any idea where you're going?
THEO: I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen. We cleared some of these same roads.
LENORE: They did some great job of reforming you.
THEO: That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas. I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
LENORE: Think you could do a picture of me?
THEO: I had it in my mind what you'd look like. Her
THEO: Developer ran out of money years back. I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
LENORE: Why are we stopping?
THEO: I need a break. I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
THEO: Who'd ever think, to look at you?
LENORE: As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked. That angelic little face wasn't me at all. I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously. I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was. That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
THEO: You've had a lot of fun with me today. What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
LENORE: We had a backup plan. But I knew you'd come through for me.
