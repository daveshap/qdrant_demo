Boss won't fire people
The title says it all. We work as a team of 9 people (more or less) delivering packages across the city (it's small) by foot through an international company. We started this a year ago with a national company, and before the project really took off, 5 people left because we weren't getting paid for it at the time. Now, two other people (not part of the original team) come in, and do whatever they please (one showed up whenever she wanted, and the other just started two weeks ago), and act as if they know what they're doing when they just started. We go in teams of two people per group, and divide the packages by zone. The one who started two weeks ago is constantly trying to take charge of delivering the packages no matter who he goes with, and walks slow (too slow for us to deliver efficiently), causing us take twice as long to deliver the packages. The one who showed up whenever is no longer working with us. I was frustrated that they weren't being hard on people to work a little faster (3 hours to deliver six packages between two people in one section of the city?), and they temporarily removed me. After I was given the chance to return is when the new kid shows up depsite us being told that the reason the former co-worker was no longer with us because they were new/inexperienced with the job, and yet they bring in someone who doesn't know anything about the process, and once they did, they began taking over no matter who they accompany to deliver.
