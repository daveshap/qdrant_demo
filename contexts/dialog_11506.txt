PREYSING: Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
BARON: I must have made a mistake.
PREYSING: Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake. Stay here... Give me that money.
PREYSING: So that's how we stand, Baron.
BARON: Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
PREYSING: Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
BARON: Be quiet.
PREYSING: I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat!
