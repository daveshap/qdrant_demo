My girlfriend is suffering from depression, and I’m looking for some advice on how I can be more supportive.
For some context, we’ve been together for almost three years and a large portion of our relationship has been long distance. She’s been suffering from depression for most of her adult life and it’s been especially bad in recent weeks. She’s a recent college grad and is really stressed out about her future, and whether or not she’s making correct decisions for her career. This causes her to feel anxiety, which in turn causes her depression to worsen and this cycle repeats. I know that I can’t cure her depression, but I want to do all I can to be supportive while she figures out how best to deal with it. Recently she’s been saying she doesn’t feel like it’s fair for me to have to deal with her when she’s like this, and she’s worried that’s it’s having a negative impact on our relationship. I’ve never really had to deal with depression as closely as I am now, and am looking for ways to improve, or even just some advice on things to do to help. I always try to be supportive, letting her know that I’m here for her and that I love her. It’s been increasingly difficult for me as she often becomes withdrawn, and with the distance and our differing work schedules most of our communication is through texting. Sorry if this post has been a little lengthy, I haven’t had the chance to talk to anyone other than her about it. I appreciate any advice you guys can share.
