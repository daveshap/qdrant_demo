firewall and virus protection I am new to ubuntu 18.04.1 lts it says that( A built in firewall and virus protection are avaliable) it says to go to activities left payne but there are no icons there for firewall or virus protection. Do l need the internet set up on ubuntu for it to show. Does avaliable mean l have to start it, enable it or what?.Can you please tell me where l can find it as it describes, It also says that yo get addded security with App Armor and gnomekeyring but where are these too as l cant find them anywhere.
