NIXON: Oh, my goodness ...
HOOVER: How about you? Are you going to win?
NIXON: You should ask Bobby.
TOLSON: ... little Bobby.
HOOVER: Would you walk with me down to the paddock? I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
NIXON: Can't we just talk here? I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
HOOVER: I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment. Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
NIXON: Roselli? Johnny Roselli?
HOOVER: Yes. Your old friend from Cuba.
NIXON: I never met the man.
HOOVER: I know you've been very careful not to. That's why I'm concerned.
HOOVER: You'll win the nomination.
NIXON: It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star. They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
TOLSON: Ummm...
HOOVER: If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
NIXON: Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
HOOVER: I know ...
TOLSON: ... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
NIXON: I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
TOLSON: ... Use his women.
NIXON: ... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again! Can you back me up on this? Can I count on your support?
