Underemployment is barely ever mentioned in this slew of positive news of the economy, in both jobs added and unemployment. Do you think it's significant?
Browsing through any news sites you'll see on the front reports of the wonderful performance of the economy, with mentions of great job growth and low unemployment rates. Browsing through any subeditor and it's full praise. But how do you think it reflects the actual reality and economic conditions of people?

I've seen an almost endless opportunity of low end low pay jobs with high turnover (or not). But regardless it's not exactly clear how much of these jobs pay dignified living wages. An economy with low unemployment but large proportion of the jobs are low paying, and part time, doesn't signify something positive.   


The economy seems to be doing great, but hearing from the impression of people, and actually applying for jobs, the wages seem still poor - in relation to living costs and inflation. High paying career oriented jobs are highly competitive, you often have to compete with hundreds of people to land these jobs.   


I mean yes I could go join one of the new jobs added that pay 10 dollars an hour and be considered employed - but is that really meaningful? I just don't buy it. Employers are still as picky as every and the ones that struggle is because they offer awful wages, awful conditions, no benefits. Usually these are the places that struggle to retain workers and have high turnover, but they usually get away with it so they don't care.  


Basically, yes more jobs, less unemployment. Though wages are still poor, working conditions haven't really improved, and the quality of these jobs are questionable.
