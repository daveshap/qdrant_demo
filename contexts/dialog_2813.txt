KENDALL: My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries. I am a homosexual.
HARDY: Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
KENDALL: He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
HARDY: I think you just blew Don't Ask
KENDALL: The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
OSBORNE: He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
KENDALL: He wanted more than that.
