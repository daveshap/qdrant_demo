EMIL: No. We are insane. Who else but crazy men would film their murders? So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there? Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted. We see psychiatrists. They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called? Oh - I got it. Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice. We come out free, rich and famous!
OLEG: Good idea!
EDDIE: You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit? How fuckin' stupid are you?
EMIL: Smarter than Americans. You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long. Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me. So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
EMIL: Okay. He has nothing to say. Start the camera!
OLEG: Cut!
