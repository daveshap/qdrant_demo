Young male looking for help with following-up and finding mental stability
Iâ€™m 17, my parents split when I was young and I recently had to move away from my moms due to lack on money and other personal issues. Iâ€™ve been at a very low point for a long time and I really need a full time job that works with school so I can save for my future. I had an interview at a place that was full time 5-11pm and I went for the interview and wasnâ€™t interviewed by the owner, but his under who said he was away. All he did was read my cover letter/resume then said thank you. I donâ€™t really know where to go and I was just wondering if anyone had any tips or anything, thank you so much and have a blessed dayðŸ’—
