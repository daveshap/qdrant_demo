PAUL: I'm afraid you will have to move room.
XAVIER: Move? Where to?
PAUL: I'm going to put you on the third floor.
XAVIER: The third floor are low class rooms.
PAUL: Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
XAVIER: Pack the bags, we have to move.
PAUL: Also, this is your bill for the last week.
