BEN: Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
MRS. ROBINSON: If you want.
BEN: Good. I mean are we dead or something?
MRS. ROBINSON: Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
BEN: All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
MRS. ROBINSON: Are you tired of it?
BEN: I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
MRS. ROBINSON: Well what do you want to talk about?
BEN: Anything. Anything at all.
MRS. ROBINSON: Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
BEN: Oh my God.
MRS. ROBINSON: Well?
BEN: Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
BEN: Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
MRS. ROBINSON: How about art.
BEN: Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
MRS. ROBINSON: You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
BEN: Oh.
MRS. ROBINSON: Don't you?
BEN: Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
MRS. ROBINSON: Go ahead then.
BEN: Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
BEN: Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
MRS. ROBINSON: Neither.
BEN: You're not interested in art?
MRS. ROBINSON: No.
BEN: Then why do you want to talk about it?
MRS. ROBINSON: I don't.
MRS. ROBINSON: Can I take off my clothes now?
BEN: No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
MRS. ROBINSON: Do you really want me to?
BEN: Yes I do.
MRS. ROBINSON: I got up.
MRS. ROBINSON: Do you want to hear it or not?
BEN: Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
MRS. ROBINSON: I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
BEN: What one.
MRS. ROBINSON: What?
BEN: What novel did you read.
MRS. ROBINSON: I don't remember.
MRS. ROBINSON: Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
BEN: There!
MRS. ROBINSON: What?
BEN: Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
MRS. ROBINSON: Him?
BEN: I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
MRS. ROBINSON: There isn't any.
BEN: There's no risk?
BEN: How do you get out of the house?
MRS. ROBINSON: I walk out.
BEN: You walk right out the door.
BEN: What do you say to him?
MRS. ROBINSON: He's asleep.
BEN: Always?
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
BEN: Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
MRS. ROBINSON: Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
BEN: But what about the noise from the car. What if --
MRS. ROBINSON: The driveway's on my side of the house.
BEN: We're talking.
MRS. ROBINSON: What?
BEN: We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
MRS. ROBINSON: Calm down, Benjamin.
BEN: Now let's keep going here.
MRS. ROBINSON: Can I undress and talk at the same time?
BEN: Right.
MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you.
BEN: Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
MRS. ROBINSON: We don't.
BEN: So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
MRS. ROBINSON: No we don't.
BEN: Well how long has this been going on.
MRS. ROBINSON: About five years.
BEN: Oh no. Are you kidding me?
MRS. ROBINSON: No.
BEN: You have not slept with your husband for five years?
MRS. ROBINSON: Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
BEN: How many times a year.
MRS. ROBINSON: On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
BEN: Man, is this interesting.
MRS. ROBINSON: Is it?
BEN: So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
MRS. ROBINSON: We've talked enough, Benjamin.
BEN: Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
MRS. ROBINSON: Not exactly.
BEN: But you don't hate him.
MRS. ROBINSON: No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
BEN: Well how do you feel about him, then?
MRS. ROBINSON: I don't.
BEN: Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
MRS. ROBINSON: Is it?
BEN: I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
BEN: Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
MRS. ROBINSON: No.
BEN: What?
MRS. ROBINSON: I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
BEN: Well, wait a minute. You married him.
BEN: Why did you do that?
MRS. ROBINSON: See if you can guess.
BEN: Well I can't.
MRS. ROBINSON: Think real hard, Benjamin.
BEN: I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
MRS. ROBINSON: Don't tell Elaine.
BEN: Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
MRS. ROBINSON: Are you shocked?
BEN: Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
MRS. ROBINSON: All right. Now let's get to bed.
BEN: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
MRS. ROBINSON: What?
BEN: I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
MRS. ROBINSON: Not particularly.
BEN: Was he a law student at the time?
BEN: And you were a student also.
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes.
BEN: At college.
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes.
BEN: What was your major?
MRS. ROBINSON: Why are you asking me all this?
BEN: Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
MRS. ROBINSON: Art.
BEN: Art?
BEN: But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
MRS. ROBINSON: Kind of.
BEN: Well how did it happen?
MRS. ROBINSON: How do you think.
BEN: I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
BEN: I'm curious.
MRS. ROBINSON: We'd go to his car.
BEN: Oh no. In the car you did it?
MRS. ROBINSON: I don't think we were the first.
BEN: What kind of car was it?
MRS. ROBINSON: What?
BEN: Do you remember the make of the car?
MRS. ROBINSON: Oh my God.
BEN: Really. I want to know.
MRS. ROBINSON: It was a Ford, Benjamin.
BEN: A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
MRS. ROBINSON: That's enough.
BEN: So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
MRS. ROBINSON: Don't talk about Elaine.
BEN: Don't talk about Elaine?
MRS. ROBINSON: No.
BEN: Why not?
MRS. ROBINSON: Because I don't want you to.
