I just had my Stanford interview and it was the worst thing that happened in my life.
I am international so it was a skype call. he said we will talk about 45 min but it was 30min. It felt like he just wanted to get over it. I was expecting it to be a nice conversation but nothing near that. I read about other interviews and how the person was nice and friendly. He was so cold and apathetic like he didn't care what was happening. 
asked me why i applied. what are my academic achievements. a recent challenge. outside school. he then asked me to ask questions. i asked 3 and then i couldnt say anything and he was like yeah nice to meet you bye.
honestly fuck everyone who wrote "see it as a conversation with a friend" and "they are to help you" and "they know how you feel".
i feel like i will cry all week.

edit: i apologize for the fuck everyone... this were my thoughts at a moment when a lot was going though my mind. i was disappointed of myself and i wanted to find somebody to blame. Sorry guys.

edit2: thanks everybody for the support, for sharing different reasons why my experience was such and for not saying maybe you suck. i appreciate it.
