Does reading this subreddit make anyone else want to shoot themselves?
In high school, I was an excellent student. 9 AP classes, a 4.3 GPA, and a top 1 percent SAT. I visited a state school with a 1400 average SAT and loved the campus. I felt great. I picked a major, Business/Finance, because I felt that’s what I felt was the best fit for me and my ECs.

I come here and start reading. And reading. And reading. I see both my school and major get shit on with no opportunity to succeed to life. I understand that this is an elitist subreddit but jesus christ it makes me feel like I have no hope for the future and no path that will ever make me successful. 

I should probably stop reading but I keep on coming back here to validate myself and my major but I realize how dumb that is and how it is futile. I keep on second guessing my school and my major even though I should be thrilled to have the opportunity to study and develop there.

I am sure that some of y’all share the same sentiment and occasionally some of the judgement may be true but damn does it hurt.
