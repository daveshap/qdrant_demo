ARTIE: Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
GILLIS: Hi, Artie.
ARTIE: Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
GILLIS: In a deep freeze.
ARTIE: I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons. Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
ARTIE: Give me your coat.
GILLIS: Let it ride for a while.
ARTIE: You're going to stay, aren't you?
GILLIS: That was the general idea.
ARTIE: Come on.
