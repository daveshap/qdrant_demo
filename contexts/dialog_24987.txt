NORMAN: Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name? But Harry never would? He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say Harry"
BETH: What do you mean, a part of Harry?
NORMAN: When did the messages start? The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
BETH: You think, in the sphere --
NORMAN: He acquired some sort of power. A power to manifest things.
BETH: But how?
NORMAN: I don't know.
BETH: How can the sphere do that?
NORMAN: I don't know, Beth. I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can. When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87. How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to. Then you found the book, remember in your lab. Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
BETH: Which I told Barnes was attacking --
NORMAN: It's his fear. The squid. He's manifesting his fears. Making them real.
BETH: But why is he doing it?
NORMAN: He must not realize he is. Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then. He must've manifested his dream.
BETH: His dream? You can't control your dreams. And you can't control your fears, can you?
NORMAN: No. I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences. You ever read the Bible? It talks about our sinful nature, you know? I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled. It's evil. It's inside us. It's what we are.
BETH: And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
NORMAN: Must be. And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
NORMAN: Looks like some sort of code.
BETH: Why would Harry go back to using a code?
