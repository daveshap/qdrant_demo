Removing default Virtualbox guest additions? I don't want guest additions. I have Virtualbox on a Windows host running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as a guest. How do I make sure that all the guest additions are removed from the Ubuntu guest? I so far have run, in Terminal, these:<blockquote>  dpkg -l | grep virtualbox</blockquote>Which returned: unity-scope-virtualbox<blockquote>  lsmod | grep -io vboxguest</blockquote>Which returned: vboxguestAlthough it doesn't show up as having the typical virtualbox guest additions, the Ubuntu screen size still resizes to the virtual machine's window. Is that actually a part of Ubuntu or from guest additions?When first installed as a virtual machine, Ubuntu supports mouse pointer integration and screen (virtual machine window) resizing, which are typically from guest additions being installed. Is there a way to remove the vboxguest kernel module as well?Thank you.
