iPhone Boot loop stuck The phone has never been jailbroken. Never got wet, anything. But after one night it reboot, and got stuck. The battery overheat and even after a few attempts to solve the issue through iTunes, Recovery and DFU mode, it continues stuck at the same part of the boot. I really don't know what to do anymore. It is an iPhone 7 Plus 256, 2 months without warranty! Thats the worst!! I'm running iTunes 12.7.2.58 on a MacBook Pro
