BILL: So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
BABY: No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
BILL: Um, yeah sure, I guess.
BABY: You sure do a lot of guessing.
BILL: Thank you.
BABY: You're welcome.
BILL: Hey, um... ...what kind of animal is that?
BABY: A dead one.
BILL: Mmmmm, this is tasty.
BABY: Ain't the only thing tasty in this house.
BILL: I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
BABY: Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
BILL: What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
BABY: Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
BILL: That's not something to joke about.
BABY: OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
BILL: Hey, great they're back.
BABY: Whoopie fucking doo.
