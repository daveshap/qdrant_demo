MAN'S VOICE: What is your name?
CARTER: That's cool. We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
MAN'S VOICE: Carter. I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
CARTER: Hey, that's whacked! I thought we was gettin' on here!
MAN'S VOICE: Shut up!
CARTER: OK. Say what it is.
MAN'S VOICE: The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made. If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
