DICKSON: Good morning, Helen.
HELEN: Good morning.
DICKSON: Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
DICKSON: I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
MATT: But I haven't . . .
DICKSON: I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
DICKSON: Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
MATT: Gee, thanks, Mr. Dicksonâ€”
HELEN: Oh!
DICKSON: Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
