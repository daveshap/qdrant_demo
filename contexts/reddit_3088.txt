Is there a career/side gig someone can take 1-2 years to learn (formally or otherwise) and then do outside of a 9-5 job?
I’m interested to know if there’s something I can commit myself to learning over the next year or two that I can begin doing in addition to my full-time job. Clearly not looking for a quick buck, which is why I’m wondering what can be learned in under two years. Anyone do anything like this?

Thanks in advance!
