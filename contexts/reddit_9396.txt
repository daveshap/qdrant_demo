We finally own a microwave!
Let me start off by saying that 2018 was actually a decent year for my fiance and I. We got engaged, I got a job that suits my mental needs more than anything I've ever had, and he got a job that doesn't make him miserable or cause his bad leg (which has steel plates in it) to act up.

But one of our favorite moments of 2018, besides the engagement, was in the final days of the year...WE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO AFFORD A MICROWAVE!! We were using the one his sister had when she was living with us for a short time, but someone broke in to our trailer and stole it. They left behind the Keurig that I've had forever, the tv and Roku that were given to us, and the PS2 that I've had since middle/high school but stole the microwave.

We've been trying to get back on our feet as quickly as possible and because of that, we've never been able to replace the missing "piece" of our kitchen and trying to heat leftovers felt like a hassle. But due to some fortunate events, he told me to pick one up the other day when we were at Walmart getting groceries.

I guess there's really no point to this story, but I just wanted to share that little bit of success with you guys!

Happy New Year, everyone!!
