I get very depressed whenever I am faced with difficult decisions. Does anyone know what I could do to reduce this?
I know this sounds like a “first world problem”, but, for example, I have been offered a new job at a different company. I won’t go into details but there are many pros and cons for both accepting the job and staying where I am. I am very indecisive and the pressure of the decision is crippling me.

I know it sounds stupid but the pain and pressure caused by this (and other similar decisions) has become so overwhelming I can’t stand it. I won’t do it, but it almost feels like suicide is a better alternative than living life through painful decision after painful decision.

Why do I feel this way?
