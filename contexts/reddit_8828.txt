What (if any) campaign laws did the National Rifle Association potentially run afoul in the 2016 presidential race?
There have been [numerous stories](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/us/politics/trump-putin-russia-nra-campaign.html) linking the National Rifle Association to [activities by Russians](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/01/590076949/depth-of-russian-politicians-cultivation-of-nra-ties-revealed) to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. 

This has led to an investigation of whether the National Rifle Association was used to [finance some of this activity.](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article195231139.html)

As it relates to Russian activity in the election, what laws (if any) did the NRA potentially violate in the 2016 election?

Edit: I think I need to say, my intention was not to re litigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, but to ask a specific question about one organization as they relate to campaign laws.
