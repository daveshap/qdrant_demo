Y’all be clicking your pen in class and the teacher says “stop clicking your pen” but now your pen is closed and you have to click it again to re-open it but you can’t because you don’t wanna get in trouble so you have to do a slow, quiet click to not alert the teacher but your pen is loud anyways?
