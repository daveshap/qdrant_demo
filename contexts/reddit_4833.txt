Does anyone have advice for how to deal with feeling hollow and disconnected from people?
So last night me and one of my buddies, who I am very close to, had a discussion on what’s been going on in my head. Lately I have been feeling super sad and borderline suicidal because I have been focusing on my childhood and have come to the realization that I had an abusive childhood. My abuse was mostly psychological and verbal, but it still hurt and I can still feel it to this day. 

Anyways, last night me and my buddy were discussing how my childhood was abusive and how I try to reach out to others (particularly women) for comfort, because I feel that I was denied affection by my mother while growing up.

All through the conversation, it didn’t feel like I was connecting with my friend, only my internal emotions and sorrow. It felt like the mini therapy session we were having was doing little. After leaving I felt hollow on the inside. It lasted till about noon this morning. Felt completely worthless and useless.

I was wondering if anyone had tips for what to do when feeling hollow and how to better connect to people.
