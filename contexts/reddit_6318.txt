Can I bring stuff to decorate my cubicle on my first day?
I have my first day at my new job tomorrow and it will be the first time I really have space or a cubicle to myself. Is it unprofessional of me to bring some pictures and other minor decor for my cubicle on the very first day? I’m not bringing anything extravagant that will take more than a few minutes to put up. I just want to give the impression that I’m here for the job, not just to make my cubicle pretty. But I do want my cubicle to be pretty. Ya feel?
