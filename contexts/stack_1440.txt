Under what conditions can Vbe exceed 0.7 I am simulating a transistor switch in PSPICE. The goal is to switch a load (like a lamp) connected in the collector on and off. Imagine that in the place of the R2 resistor there is this aforementioned load.I understand that the smaller the R1 resistor the deeper in saturation I drive the transistor which is preferable. But how small can R1 be? In simulation I am observing that Vbe can get a lot larger that 0.7 volts and Ib is getting large as well. Is this dangerous? Are there any governing equations for Ib and Vbe in the schematic topology I am using?
