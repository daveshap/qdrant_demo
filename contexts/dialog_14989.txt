JUNO: Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
MARK: You're kidding!
JUNO: I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
MARK: Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
JUNO: No, he's the dad.
MARK: Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
JUNO: The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
MARK: Well, it can really only go two ways.
JUNO: That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
MARK: Junk?
JUNO: You know... it's parts...
MARK: I know what junk is.
JUNO: Yeah?
MARK: We definitely want it to have junk.
JUNO: Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
