NORMAN: They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
SIMON: Just for fun, I guess.
NORMAN: And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
SIMON: Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
NORMAN: Apparently, they've seen all our films.
SIMON: They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
NORMAN: So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
SIMON: They actually apologized.
