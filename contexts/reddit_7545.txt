(need advice) Supervisor moves out to another school
So as the title said, early this week my supervisor told us that they'd most likely to move to another school in about 4 months. At the name they'd move, I'd have a semester left of my Master degree in the current school (school A) . I want to continue to Ph.D and had sent out registration for the program in school A (am an international student so paperwork admission is early)  and then I found out that the new school's (school B) admission had already closed. I can't really wait for a semester since the scholarship I have requires me to continue straight from Master or it will be cut. When my supervisor told me, they said I could finish my master as school A's student and then continue in school B. I don't mind doing that if my financial situation was better but because school B's area is much much more expensive and other expenses, the school B's dormitory is the only feasible place I could live in. I have asked my supervisor if they think I could get a room there, but their email replied was like "Can you just email or phone them?". It kinda broke my spirit to be fair since I know my chance would be small if I try to get it on my own (the dorm prioritize their own students after all) and they told me not to tell anyone about her moving because it's not official yet. I have looked up potential new supervisor but I feel like I couldn't contact them because it's not official yet. I feel rather helpless because I don't know what to do for my last semester...

If any of you can give an outsider perspective or advice on what I should do, I'd really appreciate it

Edit: talked to my supervisor about my concerns and they seemed to be okay if I stay, but say that they're giving me time to think until I'm 100% sure.
