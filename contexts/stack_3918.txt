How should I decide which test to use to look for differences in Kaplan-Meier curves? I'm conducting a survival analysis for my dissertation and have run into a bit of a road block about which test to use to look for differences in Kaplan-Meier curves between treatments.A previous study that was similar in design to mine used the Wilcox-Gehan D test, but I want to make sure I am choosing the test with the most power for my study design. Briefly, I have two groups with relatively small sample sizes (n=10, n=27). In the control group, I randomly right-censored individuals to pair clinical findings with the experimental group mortalities. Does anyone have strong opinions about which test would be most appropriate?The tests I know of are:Mantel-Haenzel logrank testPeto &amp; Peto logrank testGehan generalized Wilcoxon ranksum testPeto &amp; Peto &amp; Prentice generalized Wilcoxon testTarone &amp; Ware modified Wilcoxon testIf I missed any please let me know!  Thanks in advance!
