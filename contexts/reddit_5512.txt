Most Important Skills for a Patient Services Rep?
Hi all, hoping I'm in the right place. I've been job hunting for a while and finally landed an interview for a patient services representative position at a dental office. I have 3 years of experience in customer service and I have decent data entry skills. I'm just wondering what other skills might be beneficial for me to list/learn, or what I can say about myself in the interview that would make me stand out from the crowd. I've already learned a lot from following this sub, so thanks for any further advice!

Update: The interviewer seemed pleased with my research and work history, and I have a second interview coming up. Thanks everyone for the tips, they helped a lot!
