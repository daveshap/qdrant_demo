RENAULT: Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
RICK: Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
RENAULT: I think perhaps you're right.
RENAULT: It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
RICK: My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
RENAULT: And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
RICK: Our expenses?
RENAULT: Uh huh.
RICK: Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
