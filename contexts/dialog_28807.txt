PLUCHINSKY: What the hell was that?
REILLY: A ticking bomb...
WINTERS: What?
REILLY: It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
PLUCHINSKY: It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
WINTERS: We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
REILLY: I'll do it.
WINTERS: Goddamit, Reilly--
REILLY: Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
WINTERS: I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
REILLY: Yes, sir.
