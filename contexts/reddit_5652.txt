Is it stupid to try to find a new job right now?
I have gainful employment. I know this is the worst time in my life to look for a new job...  but I have been abused by my boss for 12 years and today I hit my wall.  Iâ€™m a production control manager at a steel company in the US- western PA. Is it a complete waste of time to try to look for a new job right now?  Any comments would be appreciated.
