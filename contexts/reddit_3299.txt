Feeling defeated at work. How do you get out of the funk?
I manage a sales development team at a series D start up. Been here 3 years and worked my way up out of the trenches of cold calling. 

Past few months, I've been feeling defeated  and lack the motivation and drive I've always had. Sucks because I have people to look after, and motivate.

I've been talking to some recruiters, but the issue is me not the job. 

How do you pull yourself out of  rut when it starts to affect your work?
