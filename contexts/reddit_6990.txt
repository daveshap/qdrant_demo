Just got laid off. Need some advice updating the resume of a digital marketer.
So I got laid off from my "first real job." My company decided to change directions and figured that my team was no longer needed.

It feels a bit like a kick in the teeth since I didn't even last a year at this job and won't have a steady source of income for who knows how long but I'm not going to sit here feeling sorry for myself. First thing I did after that crappy meeting was contact everyone in my network to see if they know of any openings.

I guess my question is what sort of metrics are orgs/companies looking for when it comes to hiring a digital marketer?

&#x200B;

So far, I listed stuff like:

1. Web optimization stuff like site load speed, bounce rates, and users.
2.  SEO stuff like SERP rankings for some of our pages. 
3. Conversion rates through our email marketing

Is there anything else I should be listing?

What skills should I list as well? I only know how to use Salesforce email service but don't really know how to use Salesforce itself. Should I list Salesforce anyway?

Thanks all.
