It's ok to be nervous. It's ok to be scared. It's ok to cry.
I don't know who needs to hear this, but this is recent advice that has helped me a bit with my anxiety. 

I was reminded of this before a recent first date. I was pacing back and forth, getting more and more nervous. My roommate said "it's a first date, of course you're nervous". I stopped pacing. Wait, that actually makes sense, it's completely normal to be nervous before a first date. In fact, I would say not being nervous is actually weird. I'm being normal and I need to stop reacting to my anxiety like it's not normal. I need to stop fighting it.

It's very easy to get stuck in the mindset of "If I'm not completely comfortable, then that is bad." - but it's important to remember that there is a lot of distance between comfort and uncontrollable anxiety. A lot of the people here have been on the extreme end of anxiety, it SUCKS, and it's something we'll have to continue to battle. But we should also realize that the early stages of anxiety are sometimes very normal, felt by most people. If we begin to think it's not normal, then that just helps it feed it, it spirals, it grows, and then it does become abnormal.

Anyways, random perspective that may help someone.
