CARTER: What brings the rats out of the sewers?
TAYLOR: I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean? I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
CARTER: You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
TAYLOR: It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
CARTER: At home alone - where were you?
TAYLOR: As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
CARTER: Get out...
