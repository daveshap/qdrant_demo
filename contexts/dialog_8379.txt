LEIF: That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
GIRL: Please.
SNORRI: You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
HARALD: I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
SNORRI: You're wasting your time.
HARALD: Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
SNORRI: There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
HARALD: Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
SNORRI: Same thing, isn't it?
HARALD: No, it is NOT.
