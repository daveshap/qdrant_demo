ANNINA: Monsieur Rick?
RICK: Yes?
ANNINA: Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
RICK: How did you get in here? You're under age.
ANNINA: I came with Captain Renault.
RICK: I should have known.
ANNINA: My husband is with me, too.
RICK: He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
RICK: No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
ANNINA: No.
ANNINA: Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
RICK: Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
ANNINA: No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
RICK: -- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
ANNINA: He did. Captain Renault did.
RICK: I thought so. Where's your husband?
ANNINA: At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
RICK: How long have you been married?
ANNINA: Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
RICK: So you decided to go to America.
ANNINA: Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
RICK: Yes, I'll bet.
ANNINA: He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
RICK: Does he know that?
ANNINA: Oh, yes.
RICK: And he is still willing to give you a visa?
ANNINA: Yes, Monsieur.
RICK: And you want to know --
ANNINA: -- Will he keep his word?
RICK: He always has.
