GRANDFATHER: Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me. Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
SERGEANT: Is there a fire, then?
GRANDFATHER: You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
SERGEANT: Eh?
GRANDFATHER: I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
SERGEANT: What's he on about?
GRANDFATHER: I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
SERGEANT: Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
GRANDFATHER: Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
RINGO: Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
GRANDFATHER: Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
RINGO: What?
GRANDFATHER: Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
RINGO: Have they?
GRANDFATHER: That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
RINGO: Me!
GRANDFATHER: And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
RINGO: Oh, they seem all right to me.
GRANDFATHER: That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
SERGEANT: Would you two like a cup of tea?
GRANDFATHER: You see, sly villains.
