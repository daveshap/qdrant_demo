The job prospects for arts Ph.D graduates are not great. My bf doesn't think it's worth it

I'm graduating undergrad soon, and plan to take a year or two off then go to grad school for my masters and PhD in History. I want to work in museums. I'd love to be considered an expert in my field. But apparently the job market is quite bad right now and will likely get worse. He was saying it's just throwing away thousands of dollars to end up with the same job you'd get with a BA maybe and MA. 

What are your guys' thoughts?
