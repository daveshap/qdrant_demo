HUMPERDINCK: I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off. You returned this Westley to his ship?
RUGEN: Yes.
HUMPERDINCK: Then we will simply alert him. Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
BUTTERCUP: My Westley will always come for me.
HUMPERDINCK: I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
