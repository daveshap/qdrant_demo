GEORGE: Three million. I counted it twice.
DIEGO: It's two-point-five, George. I am sure.
GEORGE: I'm calling it three.
DIEGO: We're half a million off.
GEORGE: Fuck it. I'm not counting it again.
DIEGO: Weight it. If it's sixty pounds, it's three. If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
GEORGE: I don't give a shit. Close enough.
GEORGE: Where do I put this!?
DIEGO: Try the back bedroom.
GEORGE: There's no room.
DIEGO: Try the closet.
