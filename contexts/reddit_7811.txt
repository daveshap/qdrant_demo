Anyone still working on campus?
We just got news that our university is closing for student workers today, but will be “flexible” until Friday. 

My PI seems to think that this means we should do as much as possible by Friday. I’m looking at a dozen 2 to 3 hour experiments to do by then. PI claims that funding situation is tight, with no room to budge or delay, so it must be done. “No mercy situation” PI says. “Stay safe, bye!” was the last thing PI said in our online meeting this morning. 

Moreover, PI applied for a special permit so that our group can continue to go to campus to perform experiments, as PI referred to them as so-called “critical operations”. Waiting to hear how that turns out. 

Stay safe, but also risk your health and possibly life by not staying at home for the sake of more research, because pressure from funding sources is a thing. What kind of dystopia is this?

At the same time, since campus will be closed, very few people will be there. It might just be a bit safer then. Right? 

Anyone else out there being treated like a robot during this crisis? Anyone still working on campus? I’m genuinely curious to know.
