Question about how in-school deferment actually works
So I’ve been researching how in-school deferment works and after looking all over what resources I can find I still can’t figure out a few things. For starters, it looks like services and the government use a database that gets updated by schools, but it only shows you enrolled for the current semester. 

My core question is, when I’m in grad school do I need a new deferment for every semester? Or will it continuously extend somehow? Ngl the prospect of my loans capitalizing every 3 months is pretty gross to think about

Thanks!
