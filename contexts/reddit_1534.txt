shout out to parents that really try to understand anxiety when their kids get diagnosed with it
Thanks for actually believing that we have a real disease, because you guys are out here saving lives with that mentality. Rising above the toxic stigma around mental health is so important in helping young people that suffer through it. From a kid with parents that really tried their best when I was growing up, and helped me deal with and process my needs, thank you.
