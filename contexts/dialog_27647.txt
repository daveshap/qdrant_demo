CLYDE: Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
PETE: No, sir.
CLYDE: Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
PETE: I'm not refuting anything.
CLYDE: Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
PETE: That's not a contradiction at all, sir. I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
CLYDE: Well, then, as what did you go?
PETE: I'm a little hesitant to say.
DOYLE: The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
