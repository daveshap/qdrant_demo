Working as a pharmacy tech scraping by at $35,000/year, where do I go from here?
So, where do I go from here?

I currently make $35,000 per year as a pharmacy technician. It’s not a lot, but it’s enough to survive. I don’t know where to go from here though, if I ever want to do more than just scrape by. 

I’ve got a minor disability that would prevent me from working in the trades, so that’s out. And last time I was in university, the stress got so bad, I attempted to kill myself. And my situation hasn’t really changed any since then - I’ll still have to work full-time+ while going to school. So, if anyone is able to point me in any direction that may be helpful, I’d appreciate it. Or if my best option is just to try and deal with it and handle school, well, that may just be what I have to do.
