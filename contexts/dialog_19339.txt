GIBBY: Josie, you have totally transitioned.
JOSIE: Transitioned?
GIBBY: You crossed over.
KRISTEN: Into our group.
KIRSTEN: It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
GIBBY: Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
KRISTEN: Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
GIBBY: : Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
JOSIE: Why?
KIRSTEN: We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
KRISTEN: We're very evolved.
