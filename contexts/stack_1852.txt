Something working so well you don't notice it working I am looking for a phrase or saying that simplifies this sentiment.When something is designed so well or a process works so well or a thing is executed so perfectly.  Most people wouldn't even know it was working or happening. As an example, in a similar concept: Let us say you make a major change in an IT infrastructure and no one has a clue it was done and no one complains.  Then \"No news is good news\".
