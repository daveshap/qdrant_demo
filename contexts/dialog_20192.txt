KATE: Come on, it's not so bad.
FAITH: Look how big it makes me look. I look like an Alp.
KATE: I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
FAITH: I know... It was.
KATE: But what?
FAITH: Oh, I don't know. I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be. You know, like in the movies.
KATE: That's the problem. When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies. Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap. Turn.
KATE: But one day you wake up and realize you've been had. Of course life isn't like the movies. That's why there are movies.
FAITH: Yeah. I guess you're right. I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
KATE: Let me tell you something about love. There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers. Love is hard work.
FAITH: I know. You're right.
KATE: People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive. It's not settling, Faith, it's life. Real life.
FAITH: I understand, Kate. What do you think of this garter?
KATE: I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect? Well, guess what?... It isn't. Not for you, not for anybody.
FAITH: Kate, is something the matter?
KATE: Larry brought me flowers last night.
FAITH: Is that bad?...
KATE: I think he's having an affair.
