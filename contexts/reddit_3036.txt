Is it career suicide to quit my job to work at a comic book store?
Context: I’m 27 and I make 49k. Household income including my wife  is currently 145k

For the last 2 years I’ve been a Business Analyst at an online tech company. I love the idea of the job but in practice I am constantly stressed at work and always take that stress home with me. 

I’ve looked for BA jobs at other companies but the job listing for an entry BA are very similar to my current role (company wants a ninja that can project manage for minimal pay) I’ve been questioning if I want to continue as a BA. so for now I’m trudging along at work, miserably. 

I have some ideas about non BA jobs I can transition to with my experience but every position would at least require a certificate. I’m having a hard time studying because of the constant onslaught of work stress. 

My local comic book store has an opening for a cashier. I already love the staff there and comics have always been a passion of mine. Part of me wants to take the job at the comic book store for a year while I work on myself (therapy, medication, etc.) and decide what I want to do with my career and get the credentials I need

Comic shop job only pays 8.50 and has no healthcare. This would take our household income down to 114k per year. We have no children and can easily live on 114k but it will significantly impact our retirement savings. Am I crazy for considering such a significant pay cut? Am I nuts to leave a tech job when I don’t have a tech background? Do I need to suck it up until i find a job that actually moves my career forward?
