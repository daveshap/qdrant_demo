Anyone else struggling with motivation during lockdown?
I just can't. It seems impossible. I don't know how much longer I can keep waking up, going to work from my living room, and them finishing for the day and moving 10 steps to the sofa.

I guess I'm just looking to hear that I'm not the only one feeling like this because I'm tied between feeling like a failure and telling myself to cut myself some slack
