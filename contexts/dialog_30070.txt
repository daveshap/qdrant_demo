DAVID: I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
ELIJAH: That's not what I witnessed David.
DAVID: Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
ELIJAH: I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
DAVID: You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
ELIJAH: Are you finished?
DAVID: No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me. Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
