Would you accept a newly-created Hall Director position when the students are avidly opposed to the creation of your position? (x-post /r/reslife)
I'm interviewing for a live-in, full time Hall Director position in a residence hall at an "elite" private university. At first I was really excited because the university's students have a reputation for being very smart and creative. However, the Hall Director position is new - my understanding is that historically, faculty and graduate students without professional Student Affairs training lived in the dorms and fulfilled some of the functions of a Hall Director. The university has been phasing Hall Directors in over the past few years, receiving what I have heard and read appears to be a fair amount of resistance from students as well as the live-in faculty and graduate students. 

They have left the most resistant residence halls for last, and I'm interviewing for one of those positions. I'm worried that it will be a hostile work environment, as there appears to be a lot of tension between students and ResLife staff. 

During the interviews I have been trying to better understand the environment, but everything is very polarized and the other ResLife staff just seem to be of the opinion that the students are not reasonable and I shouldn't pay them much attention when deciding whether to accept the job. But, my job is supposedly to work with these students!

Has anyone ever faced this? What questions should I ask during the interview process to help understand this situation better, and make the best decision for me and my optimal career advancement?
