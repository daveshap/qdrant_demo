Did Aunt Marguerite kill Belle\u2019s mother? Ok, so for those who didn\u2019t know, there were 2 original screenplays for the animated Beauty and the Beast. The first had Beauty\u2019s wicked sisters. The second one condensed the sisters into one character: Aunt Marguerite. She moved into Belle\u2019s mansion to look after the family after Belle\u2019s mother died. Given that she was like a wicked stepmother and she was obsessed with getting wealth and power, is there any evidence to suggest she killed Belle\u2019s mother?
