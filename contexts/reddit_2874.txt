What happens if you leave work before attending your own termination meeting?
Like for instance, if you knew that your employer was going to terminate you and they come to your desk and say, "Hey come to my office, we're just gonna have a quick meeting." And you say, "I'm actually not feeling well and I need to go home." What would happen? I am curious from an HR standpoint as I am working on an HR certification and right now, I am reading about releases/rifs/terminations.
