GEORGE: They up?
ERIN: Hunh-uh. Not yet. Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay? Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
GEORGE: How long's this whole thing gonna take?
ERIN: I don't know. Few days. Thanks for helping me. I appreciate it.
ERIN: And I miss you.
GEORGE: Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
