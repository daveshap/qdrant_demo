7 years in marketing with very little mentorship
Hi /r/jobs, I'm currently unemployed and looking for a position in marketing. For the first 4 years of my career, I was the sole marketer for two related companies. (The first dissolved and my boss started his own company and hired me.) I worked for a significant number of years as a marketer, but I feel like I didn't develop crucial foundational knowledge until much later on (~3 years ago) and since then I've had two positions with supervisors who taught me a lot about strategy, proper CRM usage, customer journeys, etc.

What approach should I be taking when looking for work? I'm finding that a lot of places want years of experience but I feel underqualified because I don't have that much under my belt in terms of a solid understanding of best practices. Should I leave those early years off my resume and apply for jobs seeking 3 years of experience? Any help would be appreciated.
