Interview for enrollment position in a professional studies school
Hello,

I will be having an interview for a school of professional studies for the position of enrollment advisor.

The position has come off as increasingly sales-like, and I've learned that this position is based off of numbers of conversions and leads. The interview is essentially a sales pitch, which has thrown me in for a loop.

Is this standard? It's out of my comfort zone.
