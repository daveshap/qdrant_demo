REDBEARD: The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
PATTERSON: I can try.
REDBEARD: Samuel says you killed a lion.
PATTERSON: It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
REDBEARD: You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck. Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you.
