Is there anyone else here that makes themselves physically sick (such as vomiting, heartburn, etc) because of their anxiety?
Hi,

I’m new here and I guess I just hope I’m not the only one that deals with this. I’m diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety.  I’ve been making myself physically sick the past week over going to a bridal shower on the weekend. The reason I have the anxiety is just the fear of being judged by others or saying something stupid.  I’ve even been in group therapy (iOP) for weeks to try and find ways to lessen my anxiety, but I just feel  like I took a step back. Yesterday, I was so stressed out about this that I caused myself to vomit even; I’ve had a migraine, some random nausea, and heartburn the last week due to the stress and anxiety too. Is there anyone else who has this happen?
