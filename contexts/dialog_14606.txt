MIKE: What kind of trouble?
OPERATOR: It's not closing, Mike.
MIKE: That's impossible.
OPERATOR: I know. But we show it's not closing.
MIKE: Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
MIKE: Damn it. I can't understand! I gotta go, hon.
KATHRYN: Don't forget you have your brother.
MIKE: Yeah.
KATHRYN: See you later.
PHILIP: Bring the crane over. Come down. Easy down.
MIKE: Hey.
MIKE: Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
PHILIP: Calvin said it was all right.
MIKE: Yeah, well I didn't!
PHILIP: Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy. I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
KATHRYN: Go where?
PHILIP: On the telly. We're to film him for the evening news.
KATHRYN: Nobody told me.
PHILIP: I just did. Can you make them do tricks?
KATHRYN: They're not tricks. They're behavior patterns.
PHILIP: Fine. Have them do some.
KATHRYN: I don't know. They're nervous and skittish right now.
PHILIP: Yes, aren't we all.
KATHRYN: That macho pompous English --
MIKE: Don't let him get you. Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
KATHRYN: My imagination isn't that good.
MIKE: Honey, I gotta go.
KATHRYN: Okay, bye.
MIKE: Make sure you put this back.
PHILIP: Aww, can't I keep it?
PHILIP: Okay now. Have Flipper flip or something.
KATHRYN: Make this quick!
KELLY: Ahhh, ahhh...
TOD: Now what?
KELLY: Gotta sneeze.
TOD: Don't you dare.
KELLY: Can't help it... ahh...
