I feel numb [NSFW]
An acquaintance of mine recently committed suicide. He took some edibles and alcohol and drove the opposite way into traffic after recording a suicide note and sending it to everyone on Snapchat. I didn't know him that well but he was a good guy. All my friends loved him, my girlfriend loved him. I loved him too, I would've been there for him. I see myself in him almost. I feel guilty. I can't cry though I just feel numb. I feel horrible.
