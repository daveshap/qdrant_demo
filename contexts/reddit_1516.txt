She said yes!
After talking to this amazing girl for over 10 months, I finally got over my anxiety and asked her out, and she said yes!

I just wanted to thank everyone in this subreddit for sharing your advice and giving me the courage to do this, you guys are the best!

If anyone else is in a similar situation, just go for it and ask them out, even though I was shaking as I asked her this, I'm so glad that I finally did it, it's an amazing feeling.

Thank you all once again, I just wanted to share my little positive story :)
