JADE: This might take some time.
MOTHER SISTER: I got nowhere to go. We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
MOTHER SISTER: Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
JADE: Yeah, me too.
MOTHER SISTER: That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
JADE: Sorry, comb got caught.
MOTHER SISTER: Be gentle, child. Mother Sister is an old woman.
JADE: How are you holding up in this weather?
MOTHER SISTER: I'll do.
JADE: I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
MOTHER SISTER: Don't like 'em. A fan will do.
DA MAYOR: I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
MOTHER SISTER: Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
DA MAYOR: I'm not stopping. I'm on my way.
JADE: You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
MOTHER SISTER: I'm not studying no Mayor. Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples. My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
MOTHER SISTER: Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house. Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
JADE: And move to Long Island...
MOTHER SISTER: And move to Long Island. Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire. Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got. I'm too through with yar people.
JADE: Whew!
