Controlling parents
So, there’s quite a bit!
(M17)

To start for past two years I’ve been wanting to dye my hair but my parents control my life and their opinion or choice basically stones anything I have plans of doing. For example with dying my hair my mom started saying she didn’t care but my dad still says my head will get shaved if it doesn’t look good. I’m not allowed to grow my hair to my preferred length and he says “only girls dye their hair”. It definitely makes me double think everything I wish to do currently. And I hold out a lot of my issues or desires from them because a lot of the time it’s downed or joked about. I hide a lot of stuff because I only have one person in my life who I can open up to, none of which are my parents or family. 

I wanna get out of my comfort zone and try new things but my parents ultimately control what I do. I’ve brought up the fact that I wanted to move out and my mom said she’d report me as missing/stolen. 

I’m not a awful kids though my grades aren’t the best. They’re proudest during football season because I’m good and stuff but they don’t acknowledge my obvious signs of depression. They believe all because I smile and act stupid that I’m fine. When I do it cause when I do act myself people ask questions and I don’t trust opening to anyone because I’ve had it held against me before. When I’m 18 I’m trying to decide what I do, move out to a friends and finish school, or wait until schools over and move away. I don’t want to live near family there’s not a lot of good memories behind it.

Anyone going through same thing? Like starting to test their limits and opening up more? How’s it going what are some little tips to get it to work better...
