JULIE: Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
RAY: What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
JULIE: We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and... You know...
RAY: This weekend?
RAY: You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
DAVE: Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
