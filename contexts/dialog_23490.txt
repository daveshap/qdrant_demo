WESSEX: Poet?""
WILL: I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
WILL: How do I offend, my lord?
WESSEX: By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
WILL: Christopher Marlowe at your service.
