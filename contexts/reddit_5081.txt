Rejected by McDonalds, do I still keep trying to apply to the same one?
Hey,

As of right now, I’m 17, and I applied to McDonald’s a month ago trying to get a job as a maintenance worker. I didn’t call until a few days ago. The reason why I called late was because I was so scared to call them a week later after I applied that I didn’t know what to say or what they’ll tell me. Anyways, they told me that I didn’t get the job and that I had to try again in 30 days. I was fine with that since it’s already been a month. So I applied for the same position, but got rejected the next day. I was disappointed and embarrassed that I got rejected. The cashier told me that I had a 100% of getting in. I guess he was referring to working in the kitchen since it’s so hectic there. 

Either way, I’m disappointed. I need a job since I’m going to college soon, but they don’t know that. The application never asked for my age or if I was in school. It only asked for my number, email, and time I was able to work. I live in a really quiet neighborhood, but I’m guessing the high school in front McDonald’s has students trying to work there too. 

The McDonald’s Im trying to apply to is the only closest one, it’s only a 15 minute walk. I’m sorry for this rant, but this is discouraging. I just want to know if I should keep applying, but for different positions, or not. I’m embarrassed that they probably know that I’m just desperate to try and get a job. 

Sorry for it being long. Do I apply as a crew member instead?
