Hubble - Cosmological vs Doppler Red Shift When we learnt about the Hubble Constant at school we were taught that Hubble had observed Red Shift due to the Doppler Effect, and thus the universe (and space time itself?) must be expanding.However, the Cosmic Microwave background (CMB) exhibits the same behaviour, but is explained through Cosmological Red Shift where the space itself is actually expanding. Was Hubble observing Cosmological Red Shift (the same principle for the CMB)? If he perceived this Red Shift as the Doppler Effect then surely he didn't conclude that space itself was expanding?
