CHARLIE: What're you doing here?
PEGGY: I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to... Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
CHARLIE: Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
PEGGY: Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better. Could you give me a ride to school?
CHARLIE: Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
PEGGY: Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
CHARLIE: How'd you know about that?
PEGGY: I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
CHARLIE: Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
PEGGY: What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
CHARLIE: Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
PEGGY: I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
CHARLIE: That's real big of you.
PEGGY: Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
CHARLIE: You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
PEGGY: Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
CHARLIE: Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
PEGGY: Just take a look at it.
CHARLIE: If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
CHARLIE: Does this mean you like me again?
PEGGY: It means I care about you and what happens to you.
CHARLIE: That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
