University job I interviewed for frozen due to crisis - what do I do now?
If anyone has any insight on University hiring at the moment, I would really appreciate it. I applied for a new position at a private University as a part of the Student Life team. I made it through a phone interview, then an all-day interview on campus, and I know I was one of three candidates for the position. I felt like I hit it off very well, but the week after my interview, University campuses closed down. I sent a follow-up email about a month ago asking about the position and a new timeline, but pretty much all I got back was that the position is on hold.

This is a really amazing position and aligns very well to my career goals, but I'm worried that it's just not going to happen anymore. The position itself was entirely new, so it's probably very easy for the university to justify canning it entirely to save money. On the flip side, the university just announced that it is increasingly scholarships for the student org that the position would be in charge of, making me think that they might still value the position. At this time, the campus is planning to reopen in the fall.

Does anyone have any advice or insight at this time? I haven't heard anything back since mid April, but I'm worried about coming off as annoying if I send any more emails. I don't mind waiting for a better time to start this position, but I don't even know if I'm their selected candidate. Should I send another follow up email?

Tl;dr The position I interviewed at a university was put on hold a month ago. Is there anything I can do, or should I just move on?
