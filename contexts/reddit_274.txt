Does anyone else here cut themselves just to feel like something.
I cut myself just to feel something, if I dont I am completely emotionally empty and I just dont know what else to do. This is the only part of my life I feel u can control. I just dont know if I'm alone in this. If you have any advice that could help me it would be appreciated.
