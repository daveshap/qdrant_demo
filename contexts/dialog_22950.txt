DIANE: I'm fine.
LLOYD: Okay, good, this is all very noble.
DIANE: Okay.
LLOYD: Alright, high level air safety tips. If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
DIANE: Okay.
LLOYD: So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
DIANE: Good to know.
LLOYD: Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
DIANE: Okay.
LLOYD: Alright, personalised flight care from Corey. Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
DIANE: Not right now, thanks.
LLOYD: How's it going?
DIANE: Nobody thought we'd do this. Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
LLOYD: No. You just described every great success story. Alright, it's alright.
DIANE: I know.
