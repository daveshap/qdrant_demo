BIG BLACK: And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
TAVIS SMILEY: Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there. We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
DELACROIX: Why'd you do that?
SLOAN: I don't want to hear it.
DELACROIX: How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
SLOAN: You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
DELACROIX: That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
SLOAN: He's just playing big brother.
DELACROIX: Oh, is he? You getting jiggy with Mantan?
SLOAN: Please don't go there.
DELACROIX: Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
SLOAN: I can't lie to him. If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
DELACROIX: Do you have to be so damn forthright?
SLOAN: DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
DELACROIX: Light?
SLOAN: That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light. This bucket of blood.
DELACROIX: You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody. I know where I made my big mistake. I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
DELACROIX: This is crazy.
SLOAN: That's why it will be so much fun.
SLOAN: That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
DELACROIX: The first and only time. A big mistake. I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
SLOAN: Work related or otherwise?
DELACROIX: Otherwise. I trust you know the difference. You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
SLOAN: DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
DELACROIX: And that's how you got me in the first place.
