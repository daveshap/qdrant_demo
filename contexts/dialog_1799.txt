Z: Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it! -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!! That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
BALA: Oh no...
BALA: Z! what are you doing?
Z: I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave. Don't argue with me. If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world. Or beans. Something like that. Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
