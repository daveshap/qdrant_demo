Anyone else have to keep reminding themselves the tightness in their chest is probably just anxiety?
Iâ€™ve been so stressed and anxious these past few days, especially after my job closing due to the covid-19 pandemic.  I keep feeling tightness in my chest and then get stressed worrying I might have a mild case.  Then I have to stop and put myself in check.  Do I have a fever?  No.  Body aches and chills?  No.  Dry cough?  No.  Does anyone else have to keep themselves in check like this?
