HILDA: How dare you write on that blackboard! Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
KLAATU: He'll catch on to it in no time now.
HILDA: How did you get in here? And what do you want?
KLAATU: We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
HILDA: Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening. I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
KLAATU: You might keep this. I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
