Literary Studies Discord Server
A bunch of us who met on r/AskLiteraryStudies studies thought it would be a good idea to form a discord server. 

I envision the discord helping us forge friendships, make meaningful connections, share resources, discuss what we've learnt and want to learn.

Amongst other things, we also have regular reading groups. We pick a topic, set a deadline, choose the reading material and discuss what we've read and learnt. 

This is a permanent invite to the server:

Thank you!
