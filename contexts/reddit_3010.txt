I’m the only engineer/designer at my company of 25 people. I’m getting burnt out. Is this normal?
I work for a high end manufacturing company. 

We have about 4 sales people, 1 accountant, 1 graphic designer, 4 custom product technicians, and a whole bunch of assemblers. 

I’m the only engineer/product designer. 

I’m getting really burnt out with the amount of work I do. I do my own work alone (immediate design/engineering work, and 5-10year design/engineering work), some production work, and when the sales people are not around, I have to answer phone calls. 

I don’t think I’ll get another help. I’ve asked, but they only hire sales person. So I kinda gave up on that end. 

I’m passively looking to find a new job, but I’m worried if this is common in any small manufacturing company. I know that it’s pretty common in my current industry, but I’m willing to switch. 

I’m worried about running out of ideas. I’m worried about not being able to get my stuff done because of all the extra work I’m asked to do. I’m just not happy with the types of work I do.
