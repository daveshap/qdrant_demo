What's "illegal" about Airbus subsidies?
Quoting from [this article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49906815):

> It is the latest chapter in a 15-year battle between the US and the EU over illegal subsidies for planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing.

Who's doing the subsidizing and what's (ostensibly) illegal about it?
