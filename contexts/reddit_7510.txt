Tips on surviving a MS program? Especially combatting procrastination.
In 10 days, I begin my masters which is an online program. I am pursuing a ms in clinical psych with duel specializations in applied research and forensics. I’m more than likely going to apply for a PsyD program. I will consider a clinical PhD but I don’t know if I would be competitive enough to actually get in (I’m in the Philly area and would prefer to stay here). 

I don’t have any real research experience except for some stuff I did during undergrad. But I will say, I love research. I have a curious mind, love looking at data and I loved writing research papers. Strange, I know. 

I refuse to let myself drop below a 3.75 GPA for this program. When I apply to PsyD programs, I want to have a few options not just one. 

My problem with school is I procrastinate horribly. I know I do it, I always have done it. I know for a fact it will not work in a graduate program. 

Any tips on how to survive and actually do extremely well?
