VICTORIA: Gesture?
BERTIE: I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
VICTORIA: No dinners, Bertie. Why are you dressed for outdoors?
BERTIE: It's so infernally cold in here.
VICTORIA: Cold is good-- Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
JENNER: I'm sorry, ma'am?
VICTORIA: Cold is good!
JENNER: Excellent, ma'am, excellent. But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
VICTORIA: Why am I being lectured in this way?!
JENNER: Forgive me, Your Majesty. In no way did I wish to suggest--
VICTORIA: I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
BERTIE: Mother....
VICTORIA: ... Least of all my son. It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
BERTIE: If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
VICTORIA: I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
