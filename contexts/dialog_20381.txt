FOLEY: I guess Adele's in good hands.
BUDDY: Sure looks that way.
FOLEY: Let's go to Detroit.
BUDDY: Now you're talkin'.
ADELE: You were <i>both</i> in the trunk? Together?
KAREN: From Glades to the turnpike. Then I left with Glenn.
KAREN: The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
ADELE: They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
KAREN: But you know what I'm talking about, don't you? About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
ADELE: I know a Glenn.
ADELE: I'm getting ready to go out. You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute. Would you like a Diet Coke?
KAREN: No, thanks.
