SUSIE: Hey, we're connected.
FRANK: Great.
SUSIE: Great?
FRANK: Yeah.
JACK: I thought we had separate rooms.
FRANK: We do. She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
JACK: I thought we all had separate rooms.
FRANK: Come on, Jack. It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together. It'll be like when we were kids. Relax. Enjoy the view.
SUSIE: You're kidding me.
FRANK: As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
SUSIE: Peggy Lee?
FRANK: Tell her.
JACK: She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
FRANK: It was April. April seventeenth. That one I remember.
JACK: We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
FRANK: Pearls. White gown. Beautiful.
JACK: Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
FRANK: A few bars!
SUSIE: What'd she sing?
FRANK: People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night. Chills. Through the whole audience. I could hardly play.
SUSIE: Wow. You ever see her again?
FRANK: No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera. God, we were just kids. That was something, wasn't it?
FRANK: Hey, will you look at that?
SUSIE: They must've bought the same map we did.
FRANK: What do you say we send a bottle over?
SUSIE: I don't believe it. You're a romantic, Frank.
JACK: He's drunk.
FRANK: Not true. Besides, Jack's the romantic.
SUSIE: Oh yeah?
FRANK: He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
JACK: Have some more wine, Frank.
FRANK: Good idea. To Peggy Lee.
FRANK: I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
JACK: Okay.
FRANK: I figure that way we won't get confused.
JACK: Right.
FRANK: Unless you want the right.
JACK: No, you take the right.
FRANK: We might as well do the towels the same way.
JACK: Okay.
FRANK: I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
JACK: Good idea.
FRANK: But if it doesn't work out, let me know. I'm,flexible.
JACK: Right.
JACK: You leaving that on?
FRANK: Yeah.
JACK: All night?
FRANK: Yeah.
JACK: We're gonna be here a week?
FRANK: Yeah.
JACK: So you're gonna leave it on. Every night. For a week.
FRANK: Yeah. You mind?
JACK: Why would I mind?
FRANK: I don't know. I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal. Is it? A big deal?
