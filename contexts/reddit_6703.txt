Is is too early to chase up my recruitment consultant?
I had a long call with a RC on the 7th where he had said there are 3 positions that he wants to put me forward for. One is actively recruiting during the pandemic and the other two will be needing someone in the next couple of months (I have a long notice period).

I've not heard anything since so is it too early to chase him up? We also just had the 4 day BH weekend so I can't imagine he was working much then as my industry is very white collar finance. 

If it's too early now, when should I get in contact?
