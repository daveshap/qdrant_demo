How to date when you’re painfully shy?
I know most people want to date someone who is attractive and has a good personality. I think I’m attractive. People tell me that I’m pretty. But I’m super shy. I have a good personality when people get to know me but it takes a long time for me to feel comfortable to let my true personality show. Most people give up on me before that time comes. I really hate it because I like myself and I know people will like me but I can’t stop thinking that people will think I’m weird. I know it’s a problem and I want to fix it. Does anyone have any tips for a shy person?
