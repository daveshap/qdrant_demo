EPPS: I said nobody dies. Nobody dies.
JAEGER: Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
EPPS: We've got rope?
WES: For climbing.
EPPS: Break it out.
JAEGER: My leg is falling asleep.
EPPS: It's not falling asleep. You've only been standing there for three minutes.
JAEGER: I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
EPPS: It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
JAEGER: How's this going to work?
EPPS: Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.
JAEGER: That's going to do it, right? I'm going to be okay.
EPPS: You're going to be fine.
JAEGER: You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
EPPS: When we start running suck up your breath. You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
JAEGER: Don't let me die, Epps. I don't want to die.
WES: What if it's a Valloro 69? Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
EPPS: You just go when I say go.
WES: Should have at least gotten the map off of him. Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
EPPS: Ready?
WES: Yeah.
