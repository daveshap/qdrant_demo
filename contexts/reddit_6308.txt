Haven't heard from my boss in weeks. What should I do?
I'm currently a Master's student starting a JD in the fall at a nationally accredited research university in the US. For reference, I also did my undergrad at this school.

Last quarter, a (full/tenured) professor at the school I'm matriculating at in the fall hired me as a part-time research assistant. He hired me primarily to work this summer, but my employment technically started in May. My employment paperwork has been successfully processed since then, and I even have an online timecard for my work. However, I have not heard a peep from him since the middle of May. About a month later in the middle of June, I asked him some questions, including for approval on some hours I did during the academic year, about the job via email. He has not responded to my inquiry. I sent him a followup email this past weekend.

What should my next steps be? I've worked many jobs in the past years, and I have never had this happen to me. I feel irresponsible for not being more proactive (such as perhaps calling him), but I'm not sure the onus is on me. Thanks in advance for your time and energy spent answering my question.

EDIT: Fixed some lack of clarity.
