BURBAGE: There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
WILL: I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
BURBAGE: Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
WILL: When I have fifty pounds.
BURBAGE: Are you writing?
WILL: A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
BURBAGE: What is the chief part?
WILL: Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
BURBAGE: The title?
WILL: Romeo
BURBAGE: I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
WILL: It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
BURBAGE: How much?
WILL: Ten pounds.
BURBAGE: You're a liar.
WILL: I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
BURBAGE: Ned is wrong for it.
BURBAGE: Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.
WILL: Done.
HENSLOWE: Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
BURBAGE: The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
HENSLOWE: And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
BURBAGE: Ask him.
