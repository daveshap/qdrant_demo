SONNY: First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
SHELDON: No more favors. That's all over, Sonny.
SONNY: Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
SHELDON: I've got a jet. I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour. I want the hostages.
SONNY: Bullshit!
SHELDON: I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
SONNY: Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
SHELDON: Okay, when do I get them?
SONNY: At the airport. We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
SHELDON: I want them all.
SONNY: I want to talk to Leon.
SHELDON: I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
SONNY: You got guts. You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
SHELDON: I have to see.
SONNY: It's the FBI. He wants to come in.
SAL: Have him walk in backwards.
SONNY: Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
SHELDON: I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
SONNY: Nothin' personal, huh? The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts. Not because it's a job. Okay, let's go ... but you gotta walk in backwards.
SONNY: Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
SHELDON: I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
