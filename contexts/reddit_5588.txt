Increasing skills/qualifications for free
At the moment I am unemployed due to a truly awful work environment and although I am looking for work I wanted to know if anyone has any tips to increase ones skills and qualifications for free. Although I do have money to fall back on I would rather than drop $100-500.00 for one course.
