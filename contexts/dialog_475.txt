BUD: What's the scoop, ace?
LINDSEY: I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses. I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
BUD: Need some help?
LINDSEY: Thanks. No, I can handle it. Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters. In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
BUD: What about O-2?
LINDSEY: Brace yourself. We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
BUD: The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
LINDSEY: I can extend that. There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module. I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
BUD: Hey, Lins... I'm glad your here.
LINDSEY: Yeah? Well I'm not.
ONE NIGHT: Right through the brainpan. Deader'n dogshit, boss.
BUD: Where're you?
