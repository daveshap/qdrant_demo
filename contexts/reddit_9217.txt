I have a job interview today.
Title. I was working in roofing, but the weather lately has put me out of a lot of work, and as I live in a weekly hotel, that really hurts. I have a two year old and my wife here, and it's hard to make ends meet sometimes. So I bit the bullet and applied for a local factory job yesterday, and today I go for an interview and tour. The pay is a good raise from what I had been making, and rumor has it there are a lot of hours to be had on a regular basis, so that's really exciting, especially considering how I'm looking to be moving to a real place and getting a car. 

Didn't really have anywhere to share this, but I'm really excited.

Edit: For those who are curious, the interview/tour is at 4:45pm, so I should be home a little while later with an update. Thanks for the well wishes, I never imagined this would blow up so much!

Edit: I got the job! Medical assessment on Monday and then I start on Wednesday. $13.05 starting and then a raise to $14-15 depending on position after 45 days.Thanks to everyone for your support.
