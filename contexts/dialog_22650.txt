RICKY TAN: You're just like your father, Lee. All these years hiding behind his badge. I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change. When you think about it, I didn't really kill him. I just put him out of his misery.
LEE: Put the plates down. It's over.
RICKY TAN: I don't think it's over. There are casinos all over this country. Let me make you a rich man, Lee. Don't make the same mistake he did.
LEE: If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
RICKY TAN: Don't you remember? I'm already dead.
