RAY: Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
CLAUDE: An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
RAY: Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
CLAUDE: Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
RAY: Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
CLAUDE: What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
RAY: They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
CLAUDE: Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
