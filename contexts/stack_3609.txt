What type of malware can see my browsing activity? I downloaded and installed Malwarebytes. After running a scan, Malwarebytes quarantined a bunch of different malware programs. What type of malware can see my browsing history, my Google searches and Facebook activity?I know that spyware and keylogger types of malware can do that, but Malwarebytes detected none of those on my computer. Instead, it detected adware, trojan agent, and all kind of PUPs. Can those kinds of malware see my browsing activity?
