ADELE: Right here. Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others. I knew them all. So did you. We went to school with most of them."
LUKE: It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it.
ADELE: After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it. The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall. Everyone finally got tired of the fighting. So they stuck it down here.
LUKE: So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
ADELE: And why not?
LUKE: Whoa.
ADELE: Sorry. You don't know how many times I've heard that. A lady lawyer? Are you crazy?" Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man. Or better
LUKE: Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
ADELE: You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
LUKE: What did... what did I want to be?
ADELE: Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman. And we were on the debate team together. But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much. And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
