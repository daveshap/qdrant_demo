PETRA: Who are you?
XANDER: We hung out last night, remember?
PETRA: I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
XANDER: Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
PETRA: Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
XANDER: You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
XANDER: Hey, you're good.
PETRA: Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
XANDER: That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
