Good luck on AP Calc and all your other exams!!

Edit: I thought my AB exam was pretty easy for the most part. In other news, Iâ€™m looking for 60 dozen jars and 12 black pans. Please DM me if you can hook me up!

Edit 2: I literally didnâ€™t submit anything for my Euro exam. Time ran out half a second before I was going to press submit. I hate my life.

Edit 3: At least I submitted my AP Chem exam, but I think I got the hardest form.
