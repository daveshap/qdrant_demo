KIRK: Back to San Francisco.
GILLIAN: Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
KIRK: There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
GILLIAN: I buy that. What about him?
KIRK: He's harmless. Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
GILLIAN: LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
KIRK: We don't want to be any trouble.
GILLIAN: You've already been that. C'mon.
KIRK: Thanks.
GILLIAN: Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
GILLIAN: So you were at Berkeley.
SPOCK: I was not.
KIRK: Memory problems, too.
GILLIAN: Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
KIRK: Iowa.
GILLIAN: A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
KIRK: Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
GILLIAN: Go ahead.
KIRK: What's going to happen when you release the whales?
GILLIAN: They're gonna hafta take their chances.
KIRK: What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
GILLIAN: It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks. What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction?
SPOCK: I meant --
KIRK: He meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going, humpbacks will disappear forever.
