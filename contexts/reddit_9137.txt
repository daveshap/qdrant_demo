LPT: Don’t buy anything but gas at a gas station. Nothing a gas station sells is a necessity in life and if it is you can get it much cheaper somewhere else. Gas stations are full of unhealthy products that are a waste of your money. Stop buying energy drinks, lottery tickets, cigarettes, junk food
If you want to save money, think about how much you spend at a gas station each week. If you are addicted to something sold at a gas station, add up how much you spend on that item per week and multiply it by 52. That daily energy drink adds up! It is estimated that smoking costs a smoker $1-2 million over their life. Sugar, tobacco, beer, the lottery are all very highly addictive and hurt you greatly physically and financially. Eliminating one of these items can change your financial situation greatly. 

If you absolutely have to have something like an energy drink buy in bulk somewhere else.

EDIT- I just got back from work and can’t believe how much this blew up!! Good tips in here and of course there are always exceptions to the rules.  To the people that left comments about how I shouldn’t tell people how to spend their money.... umm this sub is Poverty Finance! I hope it helps someone out there that is trying to do their best to work on their finances and become more aware of how much a daily stop like this can add up.
