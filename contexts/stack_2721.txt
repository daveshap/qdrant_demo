Pseudopotential in VASP I am a beginner in learning VASP (Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package) and quite interested in the PAW (projector augmented wave) method implemented in VASP. As far as I knew, PAW is an all-electron method, which defines a transformation operator to transform the auxiliary wavefunction to the true wavefunction. For an all-electron method, pseudopotential is not needed. However, in VASP input files, there is a POTCAR, which contains the pseudopotential information. So my question is what roles the pseudopotential plays in PAW method?
