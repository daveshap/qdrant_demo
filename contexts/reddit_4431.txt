psychiatric hospital helped me turn my life around
Hello again! 
I wrote in not knowing if I was going to take antidepressants. I got admitted to a psychiatric hospital a week ago and it changed my life. I was put on antidepressants every morning and anxiety medication. My out look on life has been flipped and I feel like I'm no longer in a haze. 
It does get better I promise
You are not wrong
You are a good person 
And you don't have to go through this alone. 
Thanks!
