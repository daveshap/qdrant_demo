Serious question, why do many entry level jobs require 2-3 years of experience?
Recent finance grad 21 yo auditor here. I got lucky with no experience, never had a job before, and I landed an auditor job in F500 which was requiring 1+ years of experience. 9 months experience later and I got laid off recently due to COVID-19.

I started applying for jobs again, (staff accountant jobs), and so many recruiters are calling me back for interview but on the job posting it says **2+ years accounting experience required.**

I am very strong in my accounting knowledge and my accounting experience. **So my question is, why are employers asking a minimum of 2-3 YEARS EXPERIENCE REQUIRED, when I keep getting interviews with only 9 months but they require 2-3 YEARS EXPERIENCE?**
