Story collection with upper-class fairies who amputate their wings? I was recently reading Tad Williams' \"War of the Flowers\" and one detail reminded me of something I read a while ago: it was a collection of short stories about elves and fairies - the detail was that the upper-class fairies had their wings surgically removed because flying around was seen as lower-class. It was a very striking idea, but I can't find the original story and haven't seen it acknowledged anywhere. I'm fairly sure the original was written in the early part of the 1900's, since my copy was quite old, bought at a yard sale (American, hardcover). There were a few line drawing illustrations.The only other thing I remember is one story where the two fairy protagonists, who are lovers, run away and hide in a church bell tower, where they are killed by the sound of the ringing bells (which is accurate to folklore). Their delicate wings decay, and when their bones are found, they are assumed to be two lost children and given a Christian burial.Good luck with this one! I know the details are sparse but this is all I can remember.
