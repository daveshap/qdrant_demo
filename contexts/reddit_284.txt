I might be pregnant
I was in a mental hospital recently, and I remember one or two nights where they gave me double dose of my already extremely high dosage of sleep meds.

And I've had this reoccurring dream, where I'm being... touched. I'd never had a dream like that before, and it felt... wrong.

And now, I've been feeling weird, nauseous, I haven't gotten my period, and my pants are starting to get to small.

I'm only 13, I don't even know if I am pregnant, I wouldn't know how to approach my parents with this because I'm a lesbian, and I'm out to them, so what would I even say?

I just need a serious conversation about your opinions, and advice
