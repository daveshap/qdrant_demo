DataBase Performance Issues with Indexes I'm reviewing a production database with over 400 tables and 658 indexes. I have determined that only 440 of these indexes are being used. Of these, many have fragmentation approaching 100% so I will be rebuilding and reorganizing them as needs require. Many reports are crawling, etc. One thing I noticed on querying the system views is that all indexes have a fill factor of 0. So my question is twofold: should I aim for a fill factor of 90% and monitor it, and should I adjust the fill factor BEFORE rebuilding indexes?
