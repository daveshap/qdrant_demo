Just a reminder : you can be yourself
You should never feel bad for doing something that makes you happy or helps you cope, (provided, of course, it doesn’t harm yourself or others).


I don’t care if you like pumpkin spice. 

I don’t care if you like to screech like an autistic kid. 

I don’t care if you make shitty arts / crafts. 

I don’t care if you dance in the shower like an idiot. 

I don’t care if you like leopard print stretchy pants. 




Find whatever gives you a shred of fucking happiness in this world. Take it and run and fuck anyone who judges you for it.
