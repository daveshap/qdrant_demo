Can we treat ETS(ANA) as a subset of ETS(AAA) I experimented with two series, one without trend and the other with trend. I found ets(ANA) gave better result in former (with trend) and ets (AAA) gave better results in later. But what I expected is, ets(AAA) should be providing as good a result as ets(ANA) in former series too. I thought this as I believed ets(AAA) to provide a better result in both cases because it is a superset model for all ets additive models. I used R forecast package to derive results.(sorry for asking such a naive question)
