Given the problem of widespread voter ignorance, could epistocracy produce better outcomes than democracy, and if so, should it be adopted?
I recently finished reading Jason Brennan's inflammatorily-titled book *[Against Democracy](https://www.amazon.com/Against-Democracy-Jason-Brennan/dp/0691162603/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472224252&sr=8-1&keywords=jason+brennan)*, in which he argues that most voters in democratic societies are too ignorant, biased, irrational, and/or misinformed to make policy judgment (or elect those who will) competently. In in [this post](http://blog.press.princeton.edu/2016/06/24/ethicist-jason-brennan-brexit-democracy-and-epistocracy/) on the Princeton University press blog, he summarizes the book's argument, saying:

> Political scientists have been studying voter knowledge for the past 60 years. The results are uniformly depressing. Most voters in most countries are systematically ignorant of even the most basic political facts, let alone more the social scientific theories needed to make sense of these facts.

For example, citizens generally don't know which party controls Congress (p. 25), they vastly overestimate how much of the federal budget is spent on foreign aid (p. 26); in 2000, fewer than half of Americans knew that Al Gore was more supportive of abortion rights and welfare state programs, favored a higher degree of aid to blacks, or was more supportive of environmental regulations. (p. 26) The basic problem, he says, is that individual voters' votes have so little chance of making a difference that most are not incentivized to be informed, unless they happen to find political knowledge interesting, feel they have a moral duty to be informed, or some other extenuating factor.

Democracy, Brennan argues, systematically violates the *competence principle*, "which holds that high-stakes political decisions are presumed to be unjust, illegitimate, and lacking in authority if they are made incompetently or in bad faith, or by a generally incompetent decision-making body." (p. 21) He likens much democratic decision-making to a doctor who writes you a prescription after consulting an Ouija board, and universal suffrage to indiscriminantly giving everyone a plumber's (or medical) license.

Brennan's proposed solution (or potential solution) is *epistocracy*, a system in which "political power is to some degree apportioned according to knowledge." An epistocracy makes some attempt to give more-informed citizens more political power (or give poorly-informed citizens less political power) in order to better abide by the competence principle. In the book he gives several examples of how this might work:

* **Restricted suffrage and plural voting**: Use some kind of voter qualification exam to identify which voters are more competent, and either disqualify the votes of poorly-informed voters or grant extra votes to well-informed voters.
* **Enfranchisement lottery**: Select a random, representative subset of citizens who will be able to earn the right to vote in the coming election by participating in a competence-building process.
* **Universal suffrage with epistocratic veto**: Similar to present democracies, except a formally epistocratic ruling body, open to all citizens able to meet competency or character-based requirements, is able to veto the decisions of the electorate, while these vetoes could be overridden by a supermajority vote. Brennan points out that we already have a body similar to this in the Supreme Court, which is a present-day example of an epistocratic council with veto power over decisions made by the electorate (or those they elect).
* **Government by simulated oracle**: By administering surveys that gauge peoples' political preferences, demographic characteristics, and basic objective political knowledge, we could simulate what would happen if they electorate's demographics remained unchanged, but everyone were well-informed, and then act according to this simulated electorate's will.

Brennan spends much of the book not arguing for epistocracy so much as for evaluating epistocracy on instrumental rather than procedural grounds. Democracy is to be preferred only it it produces a more just outcome, not because it is an intrinsically or uniquely just political process; he spends a few chapters addressing arguments to the contrary. He acknowledges that epistocracy in the real world is untested and will not be perfect, and will likely share many of democracy's flaws as well as some new ones, but argues that "the interesting question is whether epistocracy, warts and all, would perform better than democracy, warts and all." He thinks we have good reason to believe that it would.

The two most powerful arguments Brennan sees against epistocracy are 1) that it would likely award more political power to already-advantaged groups and/or take it away from disadvantaged ones (the demographic objection), and 2) that radically remaking social structures is dangerous given human imperfection (the conservative objection). In response to which Brennan points out 1) that the inequality causing some demographic groups to be disadvantaged and poorly-informed is a symptom of deeper issues that developed under democracy (and which epistocracy could potentially do a better job of addressing), and 2) that Edmund Burke initially raised the conservative objection in the 1790s regarding the French Revolution and in favor of monarchy, only to be subsequently proven wrong in the case of democracy.

Given the problem of voter ignorance Brennan highlights, could epistocracy produce better outcomes, and if so, should it be adopted, perhaps on some smaller scale initially? Or are there still compelling reasons to continue favoring democracy, "warts and all"?
