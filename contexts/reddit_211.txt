Friend group separating
Ok so my group in high school used to be me ( f 19), M ( m 17 ) , V (f 18) , N ( F 18) , k ( f18) and S ( f 18) and recently we got in an awkward situation. 

I’ve always liked M but m and v started dating I was a little frustrated at the beginning and I acted out. I thought more about it and regretted be jealous. I apologized to both of them and tried to be better friend with v ( m was my best friend). V ignored me for a couple months but idc that much. During Christmas I decided to throw a party and I didn’t invite her ( i asked m if it was okay and he said it was fine ) turns out it was not fine. She decided to throw a party the same day. Once I figured out I canceled my party and apologized to her. After that I tried being nice to her and she ignored me and talked shit about me behind my back. I didn’t tell anyone because I thought no one would believe me ( she is seemingly really nice ) N and S came up to me and they have told me that k and v have been talking a lot of shit about me and them. Me n and s tried to fix the situation but they kept on ignoring us. We just thought oh well. Then we started talking to M. V got really mad at us for talking to M even thought me and him been friends since I was 11. We have been trying to schedule a day so we can all talk together but they just keep making up excuses. S birthday is coming up and she didn’t invite k and v to her party because they have been saying so much shit about her. V is making m choose her or us and Idk what to do. Any advice. Sorry if this was confusing
