I can't get hired because I have lengthy gaps in my employment. How do you fix that?
My life has been a bit of a failure to launch. I'm age 30. I've had a few jobs; as a groundskeeper, overnight stocking, and very briefly for a cable company. In between those jobs, gaps that lasted a few years each, I had been attending school. But after the cable company (in 2017), I've not been employed, or at school, ever since. And ever since July, I have been trying to find work. I've gotten three interviews and was ghosted each time. I've been living with my grandmother, but she's not getting any younger. 

I don't want a high tech job. I'd really, really like to just cook food. But I can't even find work at fast food. In one job, I even had a good connection - still got ghosted. I suspect my employment history is what's keeping me back, but how does one fix that?.I'd like to actually have work on that history, but but if I can't get hired because of it, then I'm stuck in a loser's spiral. 

I live in a very rural area. I do not have the money to move. I can drive, but my own car is broken down, and I can't afford to get it fixed. I'm out of shape and I don't think I can do anything physically demanding. What the hell am I to do?
