What’s the craziest thing you’ve seen a college-crazed kid at school do?
I know a boy in AP Physics who had half our class write down all the classes they’ve taken in high school and their grades in them for his “AP Euro Research Project” to “compare US high school courses to British ones.” In reality, everyone found out he was calculating our GPAs to compare them to his lol. We don’t rank, so he was trying to make sure he was in the top percentile. He said he spent hours making a spreadsheet. Gotta love college insanity lol. What’s your crazy story?

Edit: Wow, there’s some maniacs out there lol.
