EDDIE: Jesus. Data-base hoods. It's a wonderful world. Beloved daughter missing. Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so. Dead or alive.
TATE: Vince is getting desperate. Where is she, Eddie? Where'd you stash her?
EDDIE: Where's who?
TATE: You won't even tell us?
EDDIE: I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
