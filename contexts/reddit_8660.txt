What are the causes of California's housing shortage? What steps can they take to address the shortage?
Back in 1978, before California's housing boom, the Californian people passed [Proposition 13](https://www.californiataxdata.com/pdf/Prop13.pdf) which rolled back and froze property tax values to the 1976 assessed value. Property tax increases were also limited to no more than 2% per year as long as the property was not sold. When the house was sold the property was reassessed at 1% of the sale price. It now seems that with the increasing housing prices we are seeing a spike in out-migration from California, as per this study from [California's Legislative Analyst's Office](https://lao.ca.gov/laoecontax/article/detail/265), between the years 2007 to 2016 the state lost a new 1 million residents. Now despite the fact that it is now cheaper to hold onto land as opposed to selling it, and sky rocketing home prices( [With California's median home price now topping $600,000) as per the California Association of Realtors](https://www.car.org/en/aboutus/mediacenter/newsreleases/2018releases/May2018homesales)) , why is it that we aren't seeing a co-equal influx in housing construction in California to meet the 180,000 needed annual construction of new homes ([as per a 2018 study from California's Housing Future: Challenges and Opportunities the amount of newly constructed homes only averaged less than 80,000 homes annually](http://www.hcd.ca.gov/policy-research/plans-reports/docs/sha_final_combined.pdf))
