RAY: Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
CLAUDE: He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
RAY: All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
CLAUDE: How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
RAY: We'll just get off at the next stop.
CLAUDE: Say what?
RAY: That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
CLAUDE: The hell you talking about? What train?
RAY: We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
CLAUDE: Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
RAY: Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
CLAUDE: Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
RAY: I don't know. Who do you want?
CLAUDE: Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
RAY: Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
CLAUDE: I know people.
RAY: They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
CLAUDE: You get ketchup?
RAY: Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
CLAUDE: I can't eat it with mustard.
RAY: Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
CLAUDE: What am I gonna eat?
RAY: You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
CLAUDE: Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
RAY: Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
