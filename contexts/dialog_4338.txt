ROBERT: Francesca?
FRANCESCA: Yes! Hi.
ROBERT: Am I interrupting anything?
FRANCESCA: No. I was just... No.
ROBERT: I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
FRANCESCA: The light was fading. Huh-huh.
ROBERT: I would love to come for dinner.
FRANCESCA: Wonderful. Uh...
ROBERT: Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
FRANCESCA: Oh, sure. Great.
ROBERT: I'll pick you up.
FRANCESCA: No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
ROBERT: Okay. See you later.
FRANCESCA: Yeah. See you later.
