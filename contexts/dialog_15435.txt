WOMAN'S VOICE: Huh.. .Hello?
TED: All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it. You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay? I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Ted, what are you talking about?!
TED: Don't play innocent with me, Thelma. You know perfectly well what's going on.
WOMAN'S VOICE: Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying. Where's Joanna?
TED: Ha! You tell me.
