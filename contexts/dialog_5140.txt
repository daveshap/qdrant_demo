KAYLEIGH: It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
EVAN: Might'a been nice. Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
KAYLEIGH: Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
EVAN: Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
KAYLEIGH: It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
EVAN: Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
KAYLEIGH: My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
