Anyone else in the same boat?! Wanting to make a clean break and looking for new careers that won't break the bank or require years of extra study? Would love to hear your ideas!
I'm almost 30 and really want to move away from a career in special needs teaching. Whilst it has been most rewarding, it has also been very challenging and I'd really like a change! It's something that's been on my mind for some time and spending so much time at home with the Covid-19 pandemic has really got me itching to try something different but to date my research hasn't brought me much success! 

The thoughts for spending lots of money to do further study doesn't appeal to me as let's face it college courses are ridiculously expensive so I'd want to be sure it's worth my time pursuing it! I'd love to know if there any affordable online options out there that provide recognized qualifications? Also I'd love to hear from people working in fields related working with children and special needs e.g. Autism and learn a bit about their line of work.

Since I qualified as a teacher I've always had to commute long distances for work so I'd also really love to explore options of perhaps working from home or more locally- for example pursing a hobby as a career. I'm interested in working with food as I love baking and cooking and I'd also like to perhaps make my own range of natural products. I also enjoy photography and nature so was thinking of combining the two. I've no real experience apart from working with children but I'm open to learning new skills and broadening my horizons just don't know where to start! 

As you can tell I'm in a bit of a conundrum but would really appreciate your insights  ðŸ¤—
