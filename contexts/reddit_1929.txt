Don’t talk bad about someone who got into a school you didn’t
Now I wasn’t expecting to get into Northeastern and after hearing that some of the smartest kids in my grade got deferred and rejected, I was definitely a little dismayed. But I got in. I guess I did go through what is called “imposter syndrome” because I didn’t believe I belong or deserved to go. However, after I realized that this process is very detailed and realized that they wanted me then I started to feel better. I actually felt bad for those who didn’t get in because I think everyone has something to bring. 

But now I’m just angry. 

I’m my opinion, you don’t need to try to bring others down just because you didn’t get in. Like don’t talk shit about me just because you didn’t get in, what good what it serve to you. Like it’s just annoying because I didn’t say anything to anyone, I was actually very considerate of celebrating because I know those who got rejected could possibly see. 

Sorry for the rant.

*edit*

I’m not a “pussy” or “weak” or whatever you edgy kids who think being rude is a personality trait claim. Frankly I could care less, considering the person isn’t even saying it to my face. What I am saying is why demean someone you know nothing about in a process that isn’t completely up to you. Just move on like other people do. You have every right to be upset, but you don’t have a right to demean and be be rude to someone else.
