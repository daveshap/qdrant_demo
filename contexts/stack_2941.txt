Simple computation of the spectrum of the blue sky Given an approximation of the spectrum of extraterrestrial sunlight by blackboby radiation at 5800K, between 360 and 800nm, is there a simple formula or algorithm that can be used to make an approximation of the spectrum of the diffuse blue sky at one point, at noon, on earth (with fixed humidity, pressure and temperature and zero pollutants, if relevant). And what would be the parameters to use, if any, to change the position of observation on the planet, i.e longitude and latitude ?
