After years and years of putting it off, I finally made an appointment with a counselor.
I don't really have anyone to tell, and this is a major accomplishment for me. I almost feel like crying. I don't have a good reason why I didn't do this sooner, but I'm really happy that I finally did.    

Edit: Holy cow, I was not expecting all this overwhelming love and support. Thank you all so much. I really do appreciate each and every one of you. I've never seen a more supportive subreddit. Thank you. :')
