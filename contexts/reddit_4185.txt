I can’t stop laughing about a date I was just on; I think this is a great reminder not to take ourselves too seriously.
A local online friend asked me to see a movie; I personally think a movie is a less-than-stellar choice for a first date, but I decided to go anyway and enjoy myself regardless. Though I couldn’t talk to him as much as I would have liked, he was attractive and it would still be something fun to do.

The first red flag was that he was twenty minutes late. I didn’t raise a fuss over it, as we wouldn’t have to sit through as many previews, but saw him eventually arrive in the building wearing sunglasses. Because he had a cap on as well, I was debating with myself whether or not it was him when he texted me from 100 feet away, “Over here”, rather than coming to me or even looking at me. I walked up to meet him, and he was dipping tobacco in his bottom lip. I stifled laughter as I tried not to think about the fact that he looked like a squirrel storing food, or the fact that his teeth were blackened with nicotine. At this point I was thinking “Fuck this” before we even reached the popcorn stand, but decided that I would have fun watching the movie anyway.

After the movie, he had to use the restroom and boredly placed his monster-sized Icee into my hand as he went into the loo. When he came out, he walked away from me without a word. I returned his Icee to him and did my best to make conversation; he barely made eye contact and it was considerably awkward. Think The Office.

I can’t stop giggling to myself at work, thinking about the big ass Icee and the whole situation. I wish him well, but it’s a no from me. I see it as a great lesson in taking things like this in stride and having a good chuckle about it. It was an experience at best. 

Anyway, I just wanted to add a little lightheartedness to this sub, as I know dating can be tough and even scary. We’re all trying to find our fish, and the seas can be rocky. 
I wish you all luck!
