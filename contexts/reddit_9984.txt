Online schools to knockout gen ed credits
Im not sure if this is the right place to ask but I am currently a second-semester sophomore falling behind in my gen eds. I need 3 more credit hours in humanities, 3 more in humanities-lit, 6 social science credits, and 3 more science credits. I am a film student and have classes to take for my major so I cant do all of these during the fall or spring semesters and I work during the winter and summer and dont have a car so that makes going to my local community college not ideal. Can you guys direct me to good online schools where I can knock these out?
