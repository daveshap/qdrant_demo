What are the merits of "baby bonds" as compared to other antipoverty measures?
Today NJ Senator and [likely 2020 Presidential Candidate](https://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/03/where_booker_ranks_among_the_2020_democratic_presi.html) Cory Booker came out with a proposal for giving children in the US ["baby bonds"](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/22/17999558/cory-booker-baby-bonds) which would be a $1000 initial bond for all children born in the US, to which an amount would be added each year the child was under 18 depending on their parents' income.  

Booker's proposal [closely mirrors a proposal by Darrick Hamilton and William Darity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/01/08/theres-a-serious-proposal-to-give-every-baby-born-in-america-20000-or-more/?utm_term=.fb90d7d0071c) earlier this year.

Under Booker's proposal, each child born in the US would get a $1000 initial bond at birth, and then each year if their parents were below 500% of the federal poverty line, the government would add to it, depending on income. The accounts would accrue interest as well (the article says about 3%, but it is unclear exactly how it is calculated.)

The money would only be permitted to be used after age 18 for certain permitted expenses.  A full list was not provided, but examples of college tuition, a down payment on a house, and retirement were provided.

Within the US, how does this compare to current antipoverty programs in the US like [EITC,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit) [TANF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Assistance_for_Needy_Families) and [SNAP,](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap) as well as to proposals such as Kamala Harris' [proposal to greatly expand EITC](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/lefts-trump-sized-tax-plans/573328/)

Internationally, are there similar programs which could be used as a reference point?  Are those programs similarly generous to what Booker is proposing?
