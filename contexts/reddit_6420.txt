Request for advice
Hi, new to this sub!  
  
I am looking for an IT/Programming/Computer related job.  
  
I have an Associate's degree, 2 of three years towards a BS in programming, and a Pharmacy Technician Certification. Also, I have about 4 years of medical experience working at the pharmacy (2y), a Doctors office (9mo), and a Hospital (1y, 3mo), the latter two dealing with Medical Records.  I'm currently with my company for 3 years.  
  
I also have a nice amount of programming experience, making two video games, an electronic medical record system (in progress; my side project), and a few classes worth of programs which taught object-oriented structures.  
  
I'm looking for this in really any location, and to get my foot in the door. I currently make ~$12/h part-tie, so anything around or above that rate, and full time would be great. I need to find a school to finish off that year of BS, but would like to know my chances of getting a job to finish school part time, as I'm already 25/married, and the wife wants us to start getting financially ready for kiddies. She'll finish in June with a BS in animation to go with her BS in painting, so we're not too worried.  
  
Other than the above, I just got injured and have been out for 2 weeks, and would love a desk job of sorts to help with the ankle injury.  
  
I'd appreciate any assistance and advice available.  
  
Thanks,
