JOHN: Sexual assault, Daryl. Five years. But you got lucky, right? You got away with something else. Something you figured nobody knows about.
DARYL: What I know is what I told you.
JOHN: Let me tell you what I know, Daryl. You went to Saint Xavier with Mary. You lived five blocks from her. You liked her. But she ain't interested. That must've hurt, huh?
DARYL: So what?
JOHN: So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
DARYL: Nothing.
