vertibird signals with all three factions I've sided with the Minutemen for the end game and have managed to remain at peace with the Railroad and the BoS, but by doing so I've somehow failed the \"Show No Mercy\" quest which allows the vertibird signal grenades as a reward.Is there a way to get vertibird signal grenades with the game in this state??
