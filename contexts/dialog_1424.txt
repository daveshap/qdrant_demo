ZEE: I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
JESSE: That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
ZEE: Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
JESSE: I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
ZEE: Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
