6 months of applying and almost zero interviews
I got laid off from corporate job. My side hustle actually became a success (though not enough to live off of completely) and taught me many additional sills and gave me all the experience that comes from growing a business. I think I'm pretty good at showing how both my corporate and entrepreneurial experience would make me a good fit, but I'm getting NO love, whatsoever. Am I applying almost exclusively to remote positions. Mostly junior-level and part-time. Is that the problem? Am I overqualified for the jobs I'm applying for?
