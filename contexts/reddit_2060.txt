hi
Idk people on this sub just don’t take enough time to say hi to each other. Y’all are so constantly stressed. Just take a min and a breather and stop panicking and just shhhh and SAY HI.

Edit: y’all made this thread so wholesome I’m so happy :) I’ve never talked to so many people without getting flustered because of how introverted I am, but if this is what communication feels like, I gotta do it more
