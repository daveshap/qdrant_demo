DAVE: ...That's quite a wife you got there.
ED: Mm.
DAVE: She's a rare one.
ED: How's business, Dave?
DAVE: Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
ED: All right, I guess.
DAVE: ...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
DAVE: ...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
ED: Specialty store down in Sacramento.
DAVE: Uh-huh.
