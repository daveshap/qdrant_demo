The girl I was seeing lived with my friends and I just saw her ex walk in when I was round for a sesh...
Well, the title really says most of it. I met this girl at my friend's flat a few weekends ago and we really hit it off. She moved into the flat six months ago and I just got back to town so it was likely I'd be seeing her round either way but you know, I felt good about how our dates and night went, and also after we discussed where this was headed ('give it a go' basically, because we hit it off but have different personalities). I was supposed to meet her this week but she was 'busy' and then stopped replying to my texts (I sent one a few days ago saying hmu if you want to hang and another one today asking how she was). My friends then invited me round for a bong and drink tonight and I saw her briefly in the kitchen but it was sorta like, 'hi' and I was with my friends primarily anyway so it was all good, maybe I'll talk to her later. Then her ex rocked up, and he's a pretty cool dude and they're still 'friends' but they broke up six months ago. Cool. Anyway, long-story-short I had bongs and vented to my friends about love while the girl I thought I was seeing (quite possibly, this is a vent) banged her ex. No hard feelings though, except for the lack of communication lol that was kind of unnecessary.
