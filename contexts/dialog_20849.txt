ELIZABETH: Come on!
JACK: No. This won't work. I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
WILL: No.
JACK: I'll lead them away.
JACK: Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship. I'll keep 'em busy.
WILL: Are you sure? Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
JACK: I'm sure. When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid. Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
