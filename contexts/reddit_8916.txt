[META] Thank you to our 120,000 subscribers
We've been seeing some remarkable growth lately, and today we just passed 120,000 subscribers.  I just wanted to thank all of those who have recently joined us, as well those of you who have been around for the long haul.


For those of you who are new, and even for those who aren't, I suggest having a look over [our recently-revamped guidelines.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) I know enforcement here can seem strict, and that is intentional, as we seek to differentiate ourselves from other forums in terms of the standards we apply to discussion.  We also always welcome user feedback both in regard to the guidelines and the more general aspects of moderation of this forum.

We know that this has been a tumultuous time in terms of politics and policy, and I'm proud of the effort our users and my fellow moderators have put in towards fostering evidence based discussion in what sometimes feels like an evidence-free world.
