STEW: We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
ANNE: Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
STEW: Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you? Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
ANNE: But we don't need it, I'm sure.
STEW: I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
STEW: Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
ANNE: Of course I am Stewart.
STEW: Now let's get this settled—
ANNE: You have the cutest nose I've—
STEW: Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough? What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
ANNE: What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
STEW: It isn't cheap. It's nice.
ANNE: Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
STEW: Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
ANNE: Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
