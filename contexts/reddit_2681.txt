Found out I’m pregnant before my 90 days is up. Now what?
So I started this amazing job that I truly love, especially after leaving the hell hole I was previously working at. Well, as per custom in most US companies, I’m on a 90 day “probation “ period. About 3 weeks after starting I found out I’m pregnant. I don’t need health insurance or anything like that but I do want to keep my job. Right now because I’m still in my first trimester, my job is not affected. But it will be in a few weeks as I lift heavy things and I’m on my feet 7-8hrs a day. There is talk that I will be promoted to a brand new position in the company so this also makes me take pause in telling them. This new position is ideal because it’s behind a desk anyway, but I’m afraid if I say something before I get it, I won’t. I should throw in that the work is mostly seasonal, so while I would have a job full time, the busy season wouldn’t start for a couple months after the baby is born anyway. If all goes well with the pregnancy the timing is perfect. 

Thanks for reading and if anyone has advice I’d appreciate it.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your input. I knew what I needed to do, but for some reason couldn’t convince myself of it. I am going to wait an see. My 90 days is up in October so here’s hoping I don’t spill the beans. 
I do feel like I should clarify a few things. 
First...We will not eat if I don’t work, so as much as I’d like to be a SAHM it’s not an option. 
Second, I don’t feel like I’m in danger of being let go any minute, otherwise they wouldn’t be considering me for this new position. However, due to the fact that I have to work, I feel like I should have some sense of my options. 
Third, the company I now work for is a permanent job, not a temp. I know others have clarified, but some don’t seem to read the comments so I feel like that needed to be said.  I love my job and bosses, but I also don’t know them well. I staying optimistic but cautious.
