LESTAT: What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
CLAUDIA: Does it?
LESTAT: Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
CLAUDIA: Is that supposed to frighten me?
LESTAT: You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
CLAUDIA: I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
LESTAT: Not you my dear.
CLAUDIA: You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
LESTAT: What plans?
CLAUDIA: I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
LESTAT: Stop pestering me then!
CLAUDIA: Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
LESTAT: Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
