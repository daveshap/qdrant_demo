MARTIN: Thank you. Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
BOOTH: No. Why?
MARTIN: Because someone may have gotten away.
EARL: What makes you say that?
DWAYNE: We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
