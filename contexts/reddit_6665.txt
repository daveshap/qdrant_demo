Payload Rack Officer position, contacted by a recruiter AGAIN
So I interviewed this position in late October with CompanyA. I went through the interviews and down to the final interview with the managers at CompanyA, though the position that was offered changed to another, which was not a big deal for me since it was a IT related position. This was all possible because of the Recruiting CompanyB. Though I was not given the offer at the end, since CompanyA had an internal candidate that was more fit for the position. Now I get a call from another Recruiting CompanyC for the same position I applied to with CompanyA. Is CompanyA asking for candidates from these recruiting companies so they can promote employees internally, Iâ€™m confused.
