Took a dog to the emergency clinic and got a condescending lecture from the vet
Long story short: My husband and I just drove 8 hours to take custody of his parents dogs. We just learned that they have been being neglected over the last several months as his parents are in a nursing home and the person who was supposed to care for them was not.    
    
We got here and one of the dogs, a 13-year-old miniature schnauzer, is unrecognizable as a dog due to severe matting. He is basically just one big dreadloc. One of his eyes is completely matted over along with both ears. So, being a vet tech, I said we should take him to the vet.    
    
Its Saturday and the only place open was a urgent care facility. It was an hour away as they live in a small country town.    
We wait to see the doctor and explain the situation, telling her we need to document everything excessively for the police report we're filing. Ask her what she recommends we do as an emergency today and what can wait.    
    
She said that this has been going on for months so we didn't need to bring him to an urgent care vet. She said she wasn't going to spend time taking pictures of our dog when there were real emergencies like dying dogs and car accidents to deal with.    
    
I was surprised by this as I never asked her to take any pictures or take time away from other dogs! We waited our turn without complaint and were very polite and honest with her.    
    
I just feel so humiliated now. After she left the room I burst into tears. I wasnt trying to be an annoying client. I just wanted to help this dog.    
    
     
I know I'm sensitive but I'm so distraught.
