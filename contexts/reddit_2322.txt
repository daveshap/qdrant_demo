Just found out my teacher is writing my LOR for my elder brother :/
If anyone’s confused she taught my elder brother before me and asked me if there was something private I wanted her to write.

She spoke to my mother on the phone rn and it turns out that ‘writing his sister’s recommendation is the least she can do for that child’.

I mean yea, it’s not as if I’ve lived in the shadow of my overachieving brother my entire life, my teacher doesn’t even consider me a student 

My grades are declining in her subject and I was super worried about that but this just blows it out of the water 

Feels so fucking dehumanizing 

Anyways, thanks for listening to my rant, I don’t have anyone irl I can talk to :( gonna go cry in the bathroom now
