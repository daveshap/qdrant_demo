Need help tailoring poster proposal for NASPA 2019.
I am currently working on submitting a program proposal for NASPA 2019 but the format doesn't feel right. I would like this to be simple poster presentation about the effectiveness of my program for former foster youth, but the format they ask for feels tailored towards verbal programs. Have any of you written program proposals for poster presentations? What are your tips other than what is on their webpage?
