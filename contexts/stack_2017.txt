Adjecive that means overgrown by alien life I'm looking for a word to describe terrain which is occupied by native alien life.On Earth, I might talk about a lush valley in need of environmental protection or verdant hills that would be perfect for vineyards. These adjectives have positive connotations of beauty and suitability for human habitation. What adjective would space colonists use to describe exo-planet terrain populated by alien life, especially plant-like life they consider repulsive or hazardous?Infested and blighted convey disgust and danger, and would be good descriptions if alien life was invading Earth. In this case, the alien life is in its own native environment.Teeming and crawling could describe animal-like aliens, but don't work for plant-like ones. They also share a problem with overgrown: they don't make a distinction about the life being unnatural from a human perspective.Is there a single word that will convey this fairly complex idea? I'm fine with an obscure word used by Lovecraft or 1950's science fiction if I can avoid a multi-word phrase or neologism.<blockquote>  The planetary survey described barren mountains, _______ lowlands, and warm oceans teeming with alien life.</blockquote>An obscure word I'm considering is xenic. I thought it was a neologism, but I discovered it can refer to a microbial culture containing unknown organisms. This is close to what I'm looking for, but not perfect. Is there a similar scientific adjective that better fits my criteria?
