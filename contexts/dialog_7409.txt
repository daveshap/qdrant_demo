BETH: So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
JAM: I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia.
BETH: Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
JAM: Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that?
BETH: I have all your notebook doodles memorized, Jam... Here.
JAM: Ann Arbor?
BETH: My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
