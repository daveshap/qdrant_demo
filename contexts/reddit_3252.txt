Professional level work load and expectations but paid barely above minimum wage. When is enough, enough?
A little background on me. I am 25 years old with no college degree. Since I started working at 18 I have only had two jobs. Firstly starting in a warehouse to now where I have been for 5 years working in logistics and data analyst. My current company is great for many reasons and terrible in many others. The experience I am getting is amazing and will pad my resume one day. However my largest problem with the company is the culture. Me and many other employees are expected to do work  well above our pay grade.  In a lot of ways I am grateful for this but right now it is hard to justify when I am struggling to pay rent some months. When will the experience not be worth the expense?
