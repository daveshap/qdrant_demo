People who laugh, yell, and mock the people with anxiety and panic disorders are sad people.
They have no idea what we have been through or why we have such disorders. Truly people these days have 0 empathy and yes I mean empathy not respect. No one does anymore not police not nurses and hell definently not most of the general population.
