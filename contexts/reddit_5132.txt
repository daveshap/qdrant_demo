Sick of job searching
I have been unemployed for the last 3 months after being made redundant from my last job, which I was at for about 18 months. I was also made redundant from my job before that and was unemployed for 7 months.

I have been interviewing for the last few months and have received countless rejections for jobs I am definitely qualified to do. Even some jobs that I was overqualified for.

I recently contacted a recruiter who put me up for a position I thought I was perfect for. I spent all last week going in for 3 interviews and completing a personality test to see if I fit in with the company culture (I passed this test). I’m supposed to hear back from the recruiter sometime today, but in my daily job searching I just saw that the position was readvertised this morning. So it looks like I’m not getting the job, even after 3 promising interviews.

I think I’ve reached my limit with job searching. Fortunately I have savings, so I’m okay financially. But mentally I’m just so bored and feeling drained. All I want is for someone to take a chance on me and let me get into a role and show them what I can do.

It seems that being a hard worker isn’t enough these days. The recruitment process seems to be just a series of mind games, with employers having unrealistic expectations of job candidates.

I’m really not sure where to go from here? I feel like I need to do something different, because what I’m doing right now isn’t working.
