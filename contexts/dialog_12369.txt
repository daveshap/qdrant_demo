MATLIN: It's almost over!!
BROOM: No. It's not.
BROOM: Cordon off the area. Something came through.
WHITMAN: From where??!!
MATLIN: Do you believe in hell?
BROOM: There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
MATLIN: Grigory -- That's Russian, right? Thought they were on our side...
BROOM: Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
MATLIN: C'mon -- Rasputin??
BROOM: Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs. In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
MATLIN: That makes him more than a hundred --
MATLIN: What the hell was that? An ape?
BROOM: No. It was red. Bright red.
