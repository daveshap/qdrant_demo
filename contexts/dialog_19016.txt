MONICA: You guys going to a costume party?
RAJA: We're superheroes.
MONICA: Really? Like Captain Amazing?
MONICA: Are you famous?
RAJA: Not yet.
MONICA: So you're like... struggling superheroes?
RAJA: We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware...
MONICA: Wow.
RAJA: And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
SHOVELER: Hi.
RAJA: And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
MONICA: Really?
RAJA: Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
MONICA: So what can I get you?
RAJA: Burgers all around. Medium. Rare. Raw.
RAJA: She likes you.
SHOVELER: Definitely.
RAJA: Ask her out.
FURIOUS: Nah.
RAJA: Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
FURIOUS: What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it! And then they dump you.
RAJA: So you're chicken?
FURIOUS: Who's chicken?
FURIOUS: Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
MONICA: I guess... Are you always so angry?
FURIOUS: Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
