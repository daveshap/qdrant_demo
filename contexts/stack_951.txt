Modify creation and last modified date for entire subdir This is only an issue because some antique software has Y2K issues, I need to move the file creation dates from 1990's to 2000 but for files across 21 subdirectories. A way to manage it recursively is what I'm looking for.This ends up as an NFS share back to an MSDOS client and it appears to be using the creation date. Not the modified date, as I've tried the touch mod already with no success.
