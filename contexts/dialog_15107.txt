ARNOLD: The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now. Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine. Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
ELLIE: How would we cut off the lysine?
ARNOLD: No trick to it. Just stop running the program. Leaving them unattended.
