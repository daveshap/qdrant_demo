TRAHN: How you holding up?
DANNY: I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
TRAHN: Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
DANNY: Oh shit
TRAHN: What?
DANNY: Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
