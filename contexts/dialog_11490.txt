FLAEMMCHEN: Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
KRINGELEIN: I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
FLAEMMCHEN: Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
KRINGELEIN: Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip. A Louisiana flip.
FLAEMMCHEN: No - absinthe.
KRINGELEIN: Yes -- that --
FLAEMMCHEN: You like music?
KRINGELEIN: Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
FLAEMMCHEN: A man might what?
KRINGELEIN: I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
FLAEMMCHEN: Oh -- you would!
BARON: Hello -- sorry I'm late.
KRINGELEIN: Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
BARON: Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
KRINGELEIN: A little strange, Baron.
FLAEMMCHEN: I'd given you up.
BARON: Sorry.
KRINGELEIN: A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
BARON: No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
FLAEMMCHEN: Dance then?
KRINGELEIN: She's beautiful -- isn't she?
