STAMP: Not everything. Why do you think she's really here?
AMBROSE: From her point of view or mine?
STAMP: Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
AMBROSE: One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down. Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
STAMP: Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
