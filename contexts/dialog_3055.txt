ALFRED: I am as well as can be expected.
BRUCE: Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
ALFRED: I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health. It's not civilized. I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
BRUCE: Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
ALFRED: Attending to heroes? No sir. My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
BRUCE: Not all heroes wear masks.
BRUCE: Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
ALFRED: Yes?
