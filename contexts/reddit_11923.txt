Part of my life dream may be impossible now.
I have dreamed of joining the US Army since I was 12, now that i'm 17 I've been talking to a recruiter, figuring things out, we had it all planned out. Finish highschool, enlist as infantry, do my job and try to get into the Rangers. But apparently that isn't going to happen now. I was found to have scoliosis during a regular check back when I was like 11. My recruiter knows, we went and got x-rays done and everything, just a few weeks ago. Well the army says anything over a 10 degree curve is a no go, so I nervously awaited my medical records in the mail. When i got x-rays 2 years ago it was found to be a 3 degree curve, and the MD said it only went up a couple of degrees, and that since it causes no pain I am fine to do what I wanted to. (To about 5 or 6.) But the dipshit X-ray technician decided to throw in their own notes to the records, "an 11 degree curve." How does the MD say 6, and you say 11? My dreams are on the line here and your input may have crushed them, thanks.
