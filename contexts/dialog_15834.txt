DONOVAN: What alibi?
BROOKE: I can't tell you.
DONOVAN: You understand you're on trial for murder?
BROOKE: I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
DONOVAN: Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
BROOKE: Why would I kill my husband?
DONOVAN: Insurance? A love affair? Pure unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA will come up with plenty of reasons.
BROOKE: I loved him!
DONOVAN: He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
