Safe assumption for AA and C battery current draw I have 5 LED candles with built-in timers, but they eat batteries, so I'm hoping to use an AC adapter to power them instead.  They are all different with some using AA batteries and others using C batteries, but each of them use a pair of batteries, so I'm thinking about getting a 3V AC adapter and connect all of these candles in parallel.What I'm unsure about is how much current is being drawn by each of these candles to make sure I get a sufficiently powerful AC adapter.  Since it changes throughout a 24 hour period, I don't have the equipment to measure and log that for even one cycle.  Are there numbers where I could safely assume that the candles won't draw more than x mA from a AA battery and y mA from a C battery?
