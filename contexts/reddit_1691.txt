I JUST GOT OFF THE UMICH WAITLIST OMG IM CRYING OMG OMG OMG
I got an email and it said there was an update to my application. Still freaking out can’t believe it!

Such a coincidence, yesterday I watched “now you see me” which has a ton of plot twists and i was like maybe i’ll get off a waitlist, that would be a plot twist. Also i posted a huge thank you here yesterday and i guess karma came back :)



Edit: also thank god i got in because i was still dying deciding between two other schools(uva and purdue) and now i’d pick umich over both! Here’s my other [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/g5q59c/uva_vs_purdue_for_computer_science_please_read/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), despite most people telling me to pick purdue, i was so close to picking uva🙈😂
