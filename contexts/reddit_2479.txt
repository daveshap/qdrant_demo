Is a bad boss a good enough reason to quit my job?
I (25f) was the first to be hired in a Marketing role at my company about 6-7 months ago. I've been working on anything design branding and marketing for both print and digital however I've had no say in anything, that includes the copy content or often times how something should look. Reason being is that the COO thinks herself a marketer.

Now to give you a background she's a year 9 highschool drop out who started to date the CEO who made her the COO of the company. Because she finds marketing "fun" she constantly takes over my role and produces quite terrible work. 

She tells me I don't understand how "academic" think so I couldn't produce good work (I have multiple degrees, diploma, and certification). I find how she talks and does work honestly insulting to marketing and design industry to be quite honest let alone to the company as a whole.

The staff are kind and I'm happy with the pay but she drives me mental every.single.day. at 25 I'm happy to have someone wiser to teach me and guide me in bettering my skills but with her at the most, I'll just develop bad skills.

I'm a one person department with no one else to speak to...

I decided to start looking for new jobs...lets just hope with COVID-19 I do find something but am I being immature? I know there's always someone or something in the company but after 6 months I can't imagine her to change and she'll obviously always be in the picture.

Just an update: I'd never quit without a job lined up and plenty of financial resources.
I'm from Australia, so health services is not really an issue and Covid-19 has not impacted us as badly.

I don't mean to bring insult to anyone without an education. I'm the first to graduate in my family...heck, my dad can barely read and I find him wisest of all :)
