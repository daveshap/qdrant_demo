How to get job experience when all jobs require experience?
I recently decided to switch career fields and I keep hitting this roadblock. Every job I want to apply for requires 2-5 years of experience. The companies that don't have this requirement either aren't posting the types of jobs I'm looking for or can't pay me enough for me to bother switching.

Some personal background information: I'm a military veteran with 4 years of experience doing analytical research and maintaining databases. I have a degree in English with 6 years of editing and 10 years of technical writing experience. Last year I went back to school to get my MBA and I graduate in the spring. 

This summer I attempted to get a slew of different internships ranging from PR to marketing to consulting and someone with more experience got picked every single time (isn't the point of an internship to actually get that experience!?).

So now how am I supposed to find a job in 6 months when I don't have any concrete experience (and couldn't even land an internship) in the positions I would like to do but have all types of skills, degrees, certifications, and other types of experience?
