Dad's friends raped me.
I feel paralyzed. I barely had enough energy to open up the computer. I don’t feel anything but an awfulness that crawls through my skin and an endless hollowness devoid of any light. I’d been in the shower for almost an hour and I just can’t get it out. It’s crippling me and I’m helpless. I have no one else to tell this and I just want to kill myself. I just want the pain to end.

I feel so much hate and anger but I can’t seem to muster the energy to do anything about them; even you dad. I hate you so much for letting them do this to me. I hate you so much for doing absolutely *nothing* while they raped me. Is that what friends do dad?; getting you drunk and raping your daughter? None of this would’ve happened if mom was still here. She would’ve stopped them. It hurt so much I thought they were going to kill me. Now I wish they had.

You changed a lot after her death. You stopped asking how my day was. You stopped coming to pick me up from school. All my friends they thought that my dad coming to pick me up was lame but I only wanted to see you as soon as school was over. That’s how much I love you. Do you remember telling me how much you loved me and the things you’d do for me? You only had to show a little of it dad. You only had to stay sober. You only had to remember that I’m always here for you. But no, you chose the bottle over me. And I didn’t mind cleaning up after you. I didn’t mind when you talked harsh to me even though it hurt like hell. It’s the demons you brought in with you. You let them take control of you. You let them hurt me. But I still love you dad. I always will. Maybe when I’m gone I could look after you from up above like mom was supposed to.


I needed to tell all of this to you dad. I needed to cry on your shoulders one last time but I don’t have the courage and you don’t have your mind. I hope it’s not you who finds me. Sweet dreams dad. Remember me and please forgive me.
