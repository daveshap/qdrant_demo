VICTOR: How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
ELIZABETH: It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
VICTOR: What kind of God is He to will this?
ELIZABETH: She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him. I cannot do that alone.
VICTOR: God took her from us.
ELIZABETH: He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
