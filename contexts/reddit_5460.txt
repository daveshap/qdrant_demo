51 job applications for Raytheon, still no call.
I have applied to over 50 jobs for Raytheon, I am not just applying for anything, I read the description, understand what they expect and then apply. It would be a dream come true, but I am not even getting an email back. Is it time to stop and move on? Or should I keep applying hoping someone will take a look at my resume? 

Asking for an advice.
Thank you!
