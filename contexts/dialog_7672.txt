MOOKIE: Jade.
JADE: I'm in here.
JADE: How come you're not at Sal's?
MOOKIE: I'm working.
JADE: Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
MOOKIE: I just come home to take a quick shower.
JADE: Sal's gonna be mad.
MOOKIE: Later for Sal. Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
JADE: I think no such a thing. Sal pays you, you should work.
MOOKIE: Slavery days are over. My name ain't Kunta Kinte. Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
JADE: I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all. I'm carrying you as it is.
MOOKIE: Don't worry 'bout me. I always get paid.
JADE: Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
MOOKIE: What responsibilities?
JADE: I didn't stutter. Take care of your responsibilities. Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
