ANNA: That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
NICK: It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
ANNA: --do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
NICK: Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
HEATHER: Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
ANNA: Because it means the tree is older than the house.
COTTER: Yeah, so?
ANNA: So whoever built this--
NICK: --brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
ANNA: --<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
NICK: The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
ANNA: Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
NICK: No--<u>this</u> is weird.
NICK: --sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
DOMINI: Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
NICK: Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
ANNA: It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
NICK: No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
ANNA: You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
NICK: Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
ANNA: Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
NICK: Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
ANNA: You don't want it though.
NICK: Your body, your call.
ANNA: Why is there no our" here?"
NICK: Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
ANNA: You feel no need to get married or anything.
NICK: Anna--
ANNA: --fine, later, fine.
