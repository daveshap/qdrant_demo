KIRK: Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
SCOTTY: Humpbacked - people.?
KIRK: Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
SCOTTY: Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
KIRK: You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
SCOTTY: Two?
KIRK: It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
