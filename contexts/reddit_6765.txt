Aerotek Recuitment?
Got a call from them. I'm currently unemployed and looking for work. Sounds like a decent position but after Googling them I've seen a lot of complaints about them.

I haven't yet sent them my resume - the lady who called me mentioned she "happened upon" mine but asked me to update it so she could send it to the company looking to hire me. 

After the call she sent me the details of the position. Should I just apply to the position directly and skip this recruitment stuff? I tried googling it but the only result I could find (using the copy from the details she gave me) was through Aerotek's website.

 Of particular interest from the complaints is that they take part of your salary - no thanks. I also saw that they often enter your name into a "barred pool" where the employer can't hire you unless through them. If I haven't sent through my Resume yet will I be in this pool?
