ELLE: Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
CHUTNEY: Yes.
ELLE: How many, would you say?
CHUTNEY: Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
ELLE: You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her -- She didn't have your bone structure.
