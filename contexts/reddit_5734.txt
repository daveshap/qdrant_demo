Got fired... but I'm free now.
I've spent the past 7 months at an extremely toxic job where I spent the workday being gaslit and mentally abused by my desk mate.

Today, they let me go after numerous emails from my desk mate about what an awful employee I am. Any time I've asked for help, it's dismissed or ignored. (I was even told I "wasn't allowed" to have help at one point) Last week I started discussing the possibility of hospitalization or partial hospitalization due to work/job stress putting me in a really terrible state. (I walked out and went to the ER a week ago because of the toxic coworker)

I was already planning to resign and move back across the country, but was trying to hold on until I had a job lined up. Unfortunately, I have no job offers yet, but I'm leaving a month earlier than planned and hoping it'll work in my favor, should employers start calling.

I made the decision to leave my current industry, as it's made me something of a "bad job magnet" - literally every job I've had after graduating has been so toxic that I usually don't even last an entire year. I'm terrified because after working in so many abusive situations, I don't trust anyone in any given office.

Good vibes, advice, and encouragement are all appreciated. I'm experiencing a lot of mixed feelings right now.
