BARNARD: Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
GLORIA: Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
BARNARD: Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
GEORGE: There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
BARNARD: Leaving?
GEORGE: Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
BARNARD: When are you going to start?
GEORGE: Right this very minute! The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
BARNARD: I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
GEORGE: You mean you don't want to go?
BARNARD: Well - I'm—
GEORGE: I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
BARNARD: Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
GEORGE: All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you. How about you?
BARNARD: Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey. She'll stick around too. Is that right?
GLORIA: If you want me to!
BARNARD: Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
