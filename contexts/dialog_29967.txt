SHERIFF: Is that the way you want it, boy? A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert? Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
GRACE: He killed him, Sheriff! I couldn't stop him! He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
JOHN: You bitch! You were in on it froom the start!
SHERIFF: Shut up! The both of you. Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy. Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town? You smell like trouble. Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
JOHN: I didn't do anything.
SHERIFF: Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something. He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him. And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did. I was there. Like I said; I been watching you.
GRACE: Sheriff Potter, please. I can't go to jail. I wanted no part of it.
JOHN: You liar! You wanted him dead. You seduced me into killing him!
SHERIFF: For the love of God would you two give it a rest? Lord almighty. In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic. How far did you think you were going to get with this? Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat. Now use what little smarts you got. If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
GRACE: What do you want?
SHERIFF: Same thing you want. I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please. But that takes money.
JOHN: That's what this is all about? A shakedown? You picked the wrong people. We don't have any money.
SHERIFF: Sure you do. Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house. It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him. Not for lack of trying.
SHERIFF: What'd you think, boy? That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to? Not by a long shot. You're just the most gullible. How much did you get?
JOHN: Thirty-thousand dollars.
SHERIFF: You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you . . .
SHERIFF: . . .at the very least. I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars. Now, how much did you get?
GRACE: Don't tell him anything. He can't do this.
SHERIFF: Can't I? You're out in the desert, all alone, with a body in your trunk. What do you think, boy?
JOHN: One-hundred-thousand dollars. A little more.
GRACE: Damn you! What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
JOHN: No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone.
SHERIFF: Nobody's going to hang. We're all gonna walk away with a little something. I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars. Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand. Give or take.
JOHN: And you're taking?
GRACE: That's all talk. He's got nothing on us. He let you kill Jake.
JOHN: Not me. Us.
GRACE: It doesn't matter. He was there and he let it happen. He can't take us in.
JOHN: Give him the money.
GRACE: What?
JOHN: You heard me. Count it out.
GRACE: He can't prove anything, John. He can't turn us in.
JOHN: He can kill us. I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
SHERIFF: There you go, Mrs. McKenna. Just put it in there.
GRACE: John--
