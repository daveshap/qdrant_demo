How to decide the number of options to give to people in a poll? (for opinion based, subjective contexts) Just to be clear, this question is open ended on purpose, I am fine with(or even prefer to) being pointed to a few research papers, and proper areas related to this subject. I am not sure what I am asking is called, so I am very limited in my search.Consider a general poll on a product to compare subjective choices:\"How important is the product design?\"\"How important is ease of use?\"\"How important is reliability?\"And a poll like this often has choice circles below them. For example, 5 circles are placed and picking 1 is \"Not important at all\" and 5 is \"Very important\"An example in real life is vacation polls. Every hotel I stayed at had me fill such as poll at the end of my stay. Most of the questions being highly subjective, since their job is highly subjective as well. \"good customer service\" wasn't defined, just your satisfaction.For such polls that are polling subjective matters/opinions, how is the number 5(most common I have seen) decided?If it was only 3 choices, I imagine there would be a considerable amount of information lost. Is that the case? If so, to what extent?On the other hand, I don't imagine having 100 choices would help them, since nobody can reliably say \"I would rate the customer service in this hotel at 96% whereas the previous place I stayed at would be rated at 97%\"
