I DID IT.
I FUCKING DID IT. 

I have extremely bad driving anxiety and I have been stressing about this trip for months and today was the day. I drove 2 hours ON THE HIGHWAY!!!! I WENT LIKE 100 km/hr!!!!! and then 2 hours back (in the dark!!!) !!!!!!!

I bought myself a whole pizza when I got there and SMASHED IT BC I FUCKING DESERVED THAT SHIT hahahahah

Itâ€™s literally 1:45 am and Iâ€™m so fucking happy. If youâ€™re reading this and youâ€™re too scared to do something, DO IT. On the other side of fear is freedom. I feel like I just beat a boss level. 

Good night guys, sending you all good vibes.
