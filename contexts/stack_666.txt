How to disable account logoff when closing lid of laptop I am trying to set up a home cloud server on my old Ubuntu laptop However when i leave it running and close the lid of my laptop of course I get logged out and the process stops.Is there a way to either completely disable the logoff when closing the lid OR a way to make sure the process keeps running even when I am logged off?Any help is gratefully received./Mark
