ROSEN: How do you feel about that?
WALTER: I don't feel anything.
ROSEN: You have no feelings for your niece?
WALTER: She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings?
ROSEN: Then why are you talking about this?
WALTER: Have to talk about something.
ROSEN: What are you afraid will happen?
WALTER: I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
ROSEN: Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
WALTER: I'm not that crazy.
ROSEN: Do you think you're crazy?
WALTER: If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
ROSEN: Why do you think you're here?
WALTER: You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
ROSEN: Is that what you are angry about?
WALTER: Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.

WALTER: How long is this going to take?
ROSEN: We have a few more minutes.
WALTER: I mean, when will I be normal.
ROSEN: We have a lot of work to do.

WALTER: You couldn't say.
ROSEN: I'm afraid not.
WALTER: Do you know what normal" is?"
ROSEN: I suppose it's however society defines it.
WALTER: How do you define it?
ROSEN: I don't.
WALTER: Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
ROSEN: They usually tell me.
WALTER: How do they know?
ROSEN: What is your idea of being normal?
WALTER: What is your idea of being a Jew?
ROSEN: Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you. Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
WALTER: I want to be normal!
ROSEN: Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
WALTER: Fuck you, Rosen!
ROSEN: I know --
WALTER: You don't know!
ROSEN: I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
