STEPHANIE: I had it all on tape...
JIM: What did you do then?
STEPHANIE: I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want. That's where I met him - told him what I had. The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow. So I ran...and met you.
JIM: What happened with the tape?
STEPHANIE: I took it with me. It's in a safe place.
JIM: So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
