How long did it take you guys to feel like you belonged in your program? Or does the imposter syndrome never go away?
Long story short. It’s my first year of my masters, I moved away from home for the first time and that too half way across the country. Not that that’s an excuse but if I’m finding the act of just settling in to be challenging. It seems as though everybody else knows what they’re doing and I’m just trying to keep my head above water. I know it’s not a good thing to compare but I feel like I’m constantly behind on everything and constantly stressed too. I don’t understand how I can be so behind. I don’t understand where the day goes and why I can’t get everything done. 

How do you guys plan your day? How do you not procrastinate? How long did it take for you to get on top of things? If you moved, how long did it take you to get on top of things in your personal life?
