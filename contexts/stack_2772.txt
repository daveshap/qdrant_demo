Gravity vs Electricity see-saw analogy and speed of light Does electricity exhibit anything like the following steps:1) A ball is rolled down from left side of a very long teeter-totter or see-saw2) The see-saw rapidly (immediately) tilts once the ball is passed the half-way point so that the right side is higher3) The ball will now continue moving to the right because of its accumulated kinetic energy or inertia, but also decelerates4) The ball stops momentarily5) The ball will change direction and roll back to the left side from where it was originally releasedIn Electricity, the analogy I know of is a square wave oscillating from +5 to -5 Volts across a resistor.  I have a question about step 31) Electricity moves clockwise in a circuit driven by the +5 volt of a square wave2) The square wave oscillates to -5 V3) ??? Does the movement of the electron possess a mass inertia that keeps it moving in the original clockwise direction for a short period of time???*** I am not an expert in this, but I suspect that I am not asking about the intrinsic material inductance or capacitance of the circuit.  I understand that parasitic inductance can contribute to prolonging the original motion of the electrical current.  BUT, I have a suspicion that mass inertia is a separate factor becausea) I've read derivations of the magnetic field by considering the strength of an electric field in different reference frames, and the fact that the invariance of the speed of light, as in Purcell's textbookb) My intuition is that if inductance and/or capacitance were the ONLY reason for the continued transient motion of the electron after the voltage switches, then by analogy, one should be able to calculate the speed of light from the time that it takes the ball to stop moving after the see-saw has flipped.  I don't believe that the speed of light factors factors into this, as it seems to be a purely Newtonian concept.Thank you
