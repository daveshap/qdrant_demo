STEPHEN: I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
HELEN: What's wrong?
STEPHEN: I... It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world... I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to... I miss you.
STEPHEN: Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
HELEN: Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
STEPHEN: Look, I'm sorry I --
HELEN: -- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
STEPHEN: -- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
HELEN: I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
