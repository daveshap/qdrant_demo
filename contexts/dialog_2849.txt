HARDY: Something funny, Levi?
KENDALL: I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
HARDY: Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
OSBORNE: Good idea.
OSBORNE: You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
KENDALL: You can't threaten me --
HARDY: Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
KENDALL: I didn't do anything --
OSBORNE: It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
KENDALL: What?
HARDY: That's a fantastic idea --
OSBORNE: See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
KENDALL: It won't work --
OSBORNE: It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
OSBORNE: Enjoy your flight to Washington --
KENDALL: Wait --
OSBORNE: What.
KENDALL: Dunbar's telling the truth.
OSBORNE: Wrong answer --
KENDALL: We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone. It was because I threatened him.
HARDY: Why?
KENDALL: Because of what I saw. Who really killed West.
