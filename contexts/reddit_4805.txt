I couldn’t physically describe what my depression made me feel to those who didn’t understand, so I made a short film about it.
Hi everyone,

My name is Nick Casaletto and I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for around 12 years now. I’ve seen therapist, been on countless medication and have the support system of an amazing wife. But, my depression would always creep up unexpectedly, as I’m sure a lot of you can relate, it’s not exactly fun. 

My only outlet has been movies. Since around the time I started to notice my depression at around 18 years old, I found myself sitting in my bedroom and finding solace in cinema. It was the only place I would feel comfortable being myself, my only escape from the world. 

After all of this time, my depression has matured with me. What started out as something I dealt with by countlessly drinking until I was black out drunk, to my now current quiet depression. The kind that makes you stuck in your thoughts that’s on a constant loop. I thought, (loving movies and having become accustomed to the craft of editing) why not make my voice heard. Not as a cry for help, but for others who feel like me, and can relate to the visual medium. 

Please note: the short movie is to a song that really inspired me, I was blessed enough to have the licensing and support from the band. 

I hope some of you will watch and relate.
