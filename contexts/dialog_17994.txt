WITWER: Now the second image. Watch the water. The wind's changed. The ripples are going the other way.
BURGESS: I don't understand --
WITWER: This murder is happening at two different times.
WITWER: According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
BURGESS: I know. He came to me, told me about the missing data stream. He was concerned that you might find it.
WITWER: I did find it. It was inside of Agatha all this time. So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
BURGESS: Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
WITWER: I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
BURGESS: How?
WITWER: By fooling the system. All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
BURGESS: Yes... It's called an echo. The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
WITWER: Precog Deja Vu...
BURGESS: We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
WITWER: So there is a way to fool the system?
BURGESS: Yes.
WITWER: Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
BURGESS: Shhh. You know what I hear?
WITWER: What?
BURGESS: Nothing. No footsteps coming up the stairs. No hovercraft out the window. No clickity click of little spyders. No one crashing through that door. And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny? Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
