I did drugs today [NSFW]
I snorted some hydrocodone today in an attempt to feel something other than empty. It’s the first time I’ve ever done that specifically and it worked, for all of an hour. When I came down I felt even worse than before. It’s not the first time I’ve done something like that, but it is the first time I’ve resorted to hard drugs to feel better. I’ve struggled with depression for years as part of bipolar disorder, but it’s never been as bad as it is now. I’ve had to drop out of college this semester as well as the last simply because I couldn’t reliably get out of bed. I don’t know what to do anymore, and I’m not really sure how I feel any of you can help. Honestly I’ve thought about just ending it all, but I’ve never been able to go through with it.
