DELACROIX: Yes, your name?
MONA: He, I'm Mona.
DELACROIX: Hi, Mona.
MONA: I perfectly understand where you're coming from. As a minority I can relate to your struggle also. But I think you should give us all a chance. We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
DELACROIX: Oh, is that what I'm doing?
