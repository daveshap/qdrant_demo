during one of my summers at university I was fired from a job for a very unfair reason, I am now a graduate looking for full time work and I really do not want this affecting me, can employers find out that I had been previously fired without a reference call?
So I do have this job in my resume for the month time frame I was there because I really worked hard at this job and was let go to open up a position for the supervisors friend, anyways now that I am looking for full time work I was just wondering if employers can find out I had been fired without me giving them a reference from that job
