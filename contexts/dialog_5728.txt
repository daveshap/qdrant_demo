MASON: That's my business.
ARLO: No argument there.
MASON: The guy's a fuckin' moron.
ARLO: Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
MASON: Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
ARLO: Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars. And we need that in cash.
MASON: Since when does...
MASON: ...Darlene pay you in cash?
ARLO: Since today. New policy.
MASON: 
MASON: Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
ARLO: 
ARLO: Well, he told me to collect cash.
MASON: Andy. Another fuckin'...
MASON: ...moron.
ARLO: Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'.
ARLO: Uh, huh?
ARLO: Except for the fact that I need cash.
MASON: He could've called first.
ARLO: He could've. That-That's true. But that would've been smart...
ARLO: ...and fair...
ARLO: ...two things Andy is not. Uh, but I tell you what.
ARLO: Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
ARLO: ...off. Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
ARLO: ...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over the mountain.
ARLO: That'll make up the difference, huh?
ARLO: Huh?
MASON: Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies. I could always give you that.
ARLO: Oh.
MASON: Why don't I--?
ARLO: No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
