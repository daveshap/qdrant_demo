ANDREWS: Here you are. Do you mind if I ask you something frankly? Do you love my daughter?
PETER: A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
ANDREWS: That's an evasion.
PETER: She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century! What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day—whether it's coming to her or not.
PETER: If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
ANDREWS: Do you love her?
PETER: A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts. She's my idea of nothing!
ANDREWS: I asked you a question. Do you love her?
PETER: Yes! But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
