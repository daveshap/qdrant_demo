Gauging Preparedness for Adult Life
I am attempting an extremely high response rate for a class in which I am gauging how prepared college students are for being financially independent after college. I figure the best way to do so is through college-focused subreddits. Feel free to grill me for posting a survey link below but if I at least receive a few responses, I will have achieved my goal. Cheers.
