(20F) Is saving myself for marriage dooming me to being alone?
I am an introvert who is beyond intimidated by the dating world. I am so scared to step out of my shell, and this is mainly because I have made the decision to save myself for marriage. I am scared that if I open myself to people, they will reject me for this reason. I worry about leading guys on, or that they would view me as a prude without really getting to know me first. I had one relationship before, and now feel ready to try again. Friends have suggested I try dating apps, but I worry that it is rude/irresponsible of me to go on these apps knowing full well that I would never hook-up with someone. Would that make me a bad person? 

 Is it ok to go on dating apps if I want to abstain from sex? 

If dating apps aren't the way to go, does anyone have other advice for me on how to get myself out there?
