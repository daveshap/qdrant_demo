I can quit all 3 of my jobs :D
I just got hired at whole foods for $2/hour over what I'm currently making! They have insurance too! I'll make 17.50 an hour and if I cross train into other departments I'll make more! Right now I'm working 45-60 hour weeks on top of school and I've just been so busy, to start I'm getting 25 hours a week at Whole foods and quitting 2 jobs that are just really out of the way for me and I'm keeping the job that is a block away from my apartment because it's easy and super close, I'll net about $50 less a pay period but I think the stress and benefits are worth it. I'm just so excited I'll have time to do things outside of work and school
