EVELYN: Did you get some sleep?
GITTES: Sure.
EVELYN: Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
GITTES: Where's the girl?
EVELYN: Upstairs. Why?
GITTES: I want to see her.
EVELYN: ...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
GITTES: Going somewhere?
EVELYN: Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
GITTES: J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
EVELYN: What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
GITTES: You're going to miss your train! Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
EVELYN: What did you do that for?
GITTES: You know any good criminal lawyers?
EVELYN: No...
GITTES: Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
EVELYN: What the hell is this all about?
GITTES: I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
EVELYN: I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
GITTES: Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
EVELYN: What are you saying?
GITTES: There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
EVELYN: I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
GITTES: Stop it! I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
EVELYN: ...no...
GITTES: Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
