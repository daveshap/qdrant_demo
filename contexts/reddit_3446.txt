How do people actually find their spouse/life partner?
I look around at all of my friends and sisters and other family members who are married or in a LTR and sometimes get existential about how these couples actually found each other. 

After my (24F) few unsuccessful experiences in dating so far, it blows my mind how people actually find someone who wants to go on a first date together. 

And it goes so well that both people want to go on a second date. And a third date. And a fourth date. And they are both so equally into each other, that they become an official couple. And then they get to further know each other and build mutual trust and affection. And eventually they decide that they are so compatible that they want to spend their lives together. 

From my experience in dating, I sometimes get existential about how its even possible that anyone finds love and finds their person in a sea of people who are not into you, ghost, are emotionally unavailable, have mixed signals or string you along, then leave.

I definitely don't have any harsh feelings towards anyone who does find their life partner, if anything, it's very encouraging that it's possible. It's more just baffling to me that for some people, all of this dating stuff actually works out.
