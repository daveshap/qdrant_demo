FRANK: Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
JOHN: They'll question her. Whatever they tell her could change what happens. No, I want you to follow her. See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her. When they do, you call the cops.
FRANK: What do I tell them?
JOHN: Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
