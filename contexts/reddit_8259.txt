How do the major US parties handle deaths of presumptive nominees or nominees?
This question is a little morbid, but given that [both of the remaining major contenders for the Democratic nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#Active_candidates) and [the only major contender for the Republican nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries) are over 70, and there is a pandemic illness spreading which [appears to be a particular risk for older adults](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html#who-is-higher-risk) I think it is worth discussing.

What exactly are the procedures for when a candidate dies or becomes incapacitated during the electoral process?

If before a convention, what happens to delegates accumulated by that candidate?

If after the convention, how is a replacement candidate chosen?

Is there any process for determining a nominee to be incapacitated without their consent?

These answers might differ for the two parties, so I'd appreciate if people could specify which party's rules they're discussing.
