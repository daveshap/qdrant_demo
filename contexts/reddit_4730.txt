Not realizing that it is just my mood
Hey, I wanted to reach out and see if others experience something similar. 
When i am in bad mood, the world is collapsing and I feel as if I am in bad spot in life,  there is nothing to look forward, etc. at those moments I am in like a “dream state” and I do do not realise that until the  feeling lifts, that it was just my bad toughts and it is not the reality. This dark phase usually does not last longer that one day, but when it does it becomes my whole reality. 
Does any of you also do not realize it is just a bad feeling and will pass until it has?
I hope i make sense with what i just said...
