SCHAEFER: That's over the border, General.
PHILIPS: That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course. We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
SCHAEFER: What have you got in mind, General.
PHILIPS: We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
