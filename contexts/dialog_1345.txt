SAMPSON: They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
DICKSON: All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
SAMPSON: We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
DICKSON: The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
SAMPSON: Yes, sir.
