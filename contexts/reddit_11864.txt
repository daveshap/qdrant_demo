I am a teenager that might have a crush on one of her best friends.
There’s also this thing about social anxiety, but I won’t get into that. I am a girl, and I have this friend that is a girl. Even before I came to my school, I had always seen myself as LGBT. I was never really sure of it, until now. When I met her, I thought she was so pretty, and now she’s a really good friend of mine, and here’s why I’m suspicious. I just want to make her proud, and I want her to look at me like she loves me. Like, idk she’s in love with me. But at the same time, I can’t and do not want to imagine that because I’m scared and whenever I think that I always feel weird for thinking about her that way. I get so angry for imagining things like that. Please help, do I really like her? You can ask me anything you need, but I need to know because it has been bothering me so much. Thank you,,
