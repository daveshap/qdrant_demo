How to identify if a problem is a good candidate for applying machine learning? Specifically, I am talking about supervised learning. It seems that a problem is a good candidate for applying ML if:We have fairly high-accuracy ground-truth labels in our dataset. The dataset is randomly sampled from the underlying distribution and uniformly labelled. The distribution from which the data is sampled stays relatively constant; the model will be applied to data sampled from the same distribution. In other words, the function we are trying to learn stays constant.The output we are trying to learn is actually a function of the inputs we are given.The effective number of independent samples in our dataset is high enough for the levels of noise in the dataset (sources of noise are noise in the inputs, noise in the labels, covariate shifts) and for the complexity of the relationships we are trying to model.The metric we would like our model to optimize is quantifiable.Would that be accurate? Should anything be added to this list or changed in it?
