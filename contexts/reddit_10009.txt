Employment Outlook in Campus Recreation?
Title basically sums it up - does anyone in this community have any insight into the employment outlook for the campus recreation field? 

I know campus rec isn't always considered a part of student affairs, but I'm considering going back to school to enter the field full time, and want to my research on job outlook before I make that decision. The only thing I can find online is the obvious - NIRSA and its job board, and even there one can only make an observation on the job board, can't find any hard data on job numbers. 

Background: I got my bachelors in Kinesiology with a focus on Sport Management a few years ago and spent 3 years working in campus rec during undergrad, and my current job is relatively similar, so I have solid experience and a few contacts in the field. Obviously I will gauge their opinions as well, but I wanted to tap into the collective knowledge of this community. Thanks in advance for the help.
