Why is terrorism so high on US priority list?
 According to the [Global Terrorist Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_AmericanTerrorismDeaths_FactSheet_Oct2015.pdf) the total number of American deaths worldwide related to terrorism between 1995 and 2014 is 3,503, which avergages out to approximatly 184 deaths per year. [Twice as many people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate#United_States) die per year due to workplace accidents in retail alone.

At the same time, [experts estimate](http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/16/news/economy/cost-of-fighting-terrorism/) the US spends more than $100billion anually on counter-terrorism efforts, or [roughly 3% of its budget---about the same as it spends on Education and more than it spends on Transporation infrastructure costs or Science and Medical research](http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/policy-basics-where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go). Voters [view terrorism](http://www.pollingreport.com/prioriti.htm) as more important to the American agenda than almost any other topic, including health care, climate change, and immigration.

What accounts for the disparity between actual threat of terrorism and its perceived importance?
