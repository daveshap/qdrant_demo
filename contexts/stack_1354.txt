How can I keep a hanging cloth hydrated? As the summers are approaching, it kinda gets hot in my room. I make it cooler by dipping a bed-sheet in water and then hanging it on the curtain rod next to the window.This cools down the air that enters my room and it feels awesome to be in this naturally-cooled room.However, the cloth dries up every hour. When this happens I need to drench it in water, wring it, so that it's not soaking wet, and then hang it up again. Qs: I'm wondering if there's a way I could keep this cloth hydrated throughout the day? Is there something that I could place on top of the curtain rod, that releases water slowly to keep the cloth hydrated?
