Does anyone here experience imposter syndrome?
Does anyone struggle with imposter syndrome? I have been in my industry for about 4 years, and have taken quite a bit of licensing/continuing education to progress my career. However, sometimes I still feel inadequate and feel stressed when I don't know the answer to something. Does anyone else experience this or have tips on how to deal with it?
