SAILOR: What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
LULA: Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
SAILOR: More'n likely.
LULA: I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
SAILOR: I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
LULA: Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
