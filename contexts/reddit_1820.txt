"The Organic Chemistry" is on of the best academic resources one can use throughout high school period.
This man is a literal living legend. He has literally every video possible for math, chemistry, and physics. Some of his lessons will line up so conveniently with your school, **you'll think he was a previous alumni.** 

His videos are so informative it's actually batshit insane. He will have **every** damn example an evil teacher will throw at you during a test. When I say this man covers everything, I mean it. He never assumes anything and always reviews concepts very briefly if you may have missed them. He will never let go of your hand when it comes to teaching you.

You will literally never have to open your textbook because of this man. Check his videos out. They helped me ace most of my math and science classes throughout high school
