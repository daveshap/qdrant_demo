BUCKAROO BANZAI: Never.
PENNY PRIDDY: I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this. Oh, boy...
BUCKAROO BANZAI: I gotta go. We're on borrowed time.
PENNY PRIDDY: Go where? Where're you going?
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Please, Penny. You just gotta trust me now. Okay? And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
PENNY PRIDDY: What? If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
PENNY PRIDDY: Believe in Penny Priddy?
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Absolutely.
PENNY PRIDDY: You've got your six guns strapped on. You're ridding off on another adventure? Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real. I should go with you. Please...
BUCKAROO BANZAI: It's too dangerous.
PENNY PRIDDY: That's just what you would say. This is so unreal. I'm dreaming...
PERFECT TOMMY: Buckaroo--! Sorry--
BUCKAROO BANZAI: What is it, Tommy?
PERFECT TOMMY: Sam's dead! Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
BUCKAROO BANZAI: Stay here, I'll be back.
PENNY PRIDDY: Sure. I won't hold my breath.
