Boss said he'd fully support me for an internal promotion, just informed me he's applying for same promotion. Shitty or illegal?
I'm currently working as assistant director and a position opened up for a director spot in another department. In order to apply, I had to tell my direct supervisor (my director) that I was interested in the position. So I did. He told me that he thought that I'd be an awesome fit for that position, that he would recommend me, that he'd fully support me going for that role, and that he wasn't interested in the position for himself. 

I applied for the position before the closing date (along with submitting an updated resume and portfolio), came into the office from paternity leave and interviewed for the position (2 weeks ago), and just submitted an assessment (spent about 35 hours putting it together) for the position today.

My director pulled me aside just before i submitted my assessment to tell me that he wanted to apply for the same position and that he wanted to "clear the air" around it and "may the best man win".  Along with that he told me that he had pitched a new position above the one that we are applying for and got rejected and that was one of the reasons he was now applying. He also said that he had been given the same assessment task.

A few other things really got me pissed even more:

* The deadline to apply was 3 weeks ago.
* I'm not sure if he had to actually apply and interview before being given the assessment but it sounds like he didn't.

I just want to make sure I have an even playing field and I'm not getting dicked around. I have a good rapport with the individuals doing the interviewing and evaluation of the assessments who are outside of the HR department. Should I bring up my concerns to them or should I go straight to HR with my concerns? Is what he's doing just shitty or is the special treatment he may be getting potentially illegal?
