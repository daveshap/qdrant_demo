PINKER: Cotton balls. I found them just inside the meat locker door.
BUD: <u>Ear plugs</u>.
PINKER: Exactly. At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
BUD: It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
PINKER: What do you mean?
BUD: It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
PINKER: Yeah, so...
BUD: Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D. I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
MRS. LEFFERTS: Let my daughter rest in peace.
BUD: Five minutes. That's all.
BUD: Tell me about the boyfriend she had. The one you mentioned at the morgue.
MRS. LEFFERTS: First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died.
BUD: Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
MRS. LEFFERTS: Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend. He was too old for you. You let him come into this house and be fresh to me. I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
BUD: What was that boyfriend's name?
MRS. LEFFERTS: We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day. She called him by a nickname. Muns or Lunts or something.
BUD: Stens? Was it Stens?
MRS. LEFFERTS: Maybe. I don't know.
BUD: Look at a picture for me.
MRS. LEFFERTS: That's him. That's him.
BUD: You said a neighbor heard a ruckus. Was it outside, inside?
