CHUTNEY: I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
DONOVAN: Did she have a weapon in her hand?
CHUTNEY: No.
DONOVAN: Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
CHUTNEY: Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
DONOVAN: Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
CHUTNEY: His dead body with a bullet in it.
DONOVAN: What did you see when you entered the house?
ENRIQUE: I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
DONOVAN: Was she carrying a weapon?
ENRIQUE: No, she was crying her eyes out.
DONOVAN: So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
ENRIQUE: Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
