I’m a 20 m and have never dated due to a bad home life. I’ve been out on my own since the start of the year and still don’t know where to start.
EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for all the support and advice! Please don’t stop if you want to add anything else lol. I just wanted to show my appreciation if I don’t thank each of you individually.


TL;DR is basically the title. I have some baggage because of the bad situation I came out of. What follows is a fair bit of context for anyone who wants it.


Long story short, I dealt with a lot of isolation, manipulation, and domestic abuse (nothing physical) for most of my life. I escaped it all with my brother back in January and am happily on my own away from my messed up family.

I’m socially awkward due to this past, but I’m steadily improving myself in the world. I’m not in that great of a position financially, but then again, I’m starting from scratch so I won’t be 100% for a few years at least. I got a GED, a license, a part time job, a place to stay until I can afford my own rent, and have even branched out to form some platonic relationships. I would only dream of obtaining those things back at my old home. But as much as I’m improving in my life, I haven’t made much progress in as far as romance goes.

I don’t really have a car, so I’m limited to the place I’m in. It’s not ideal, but it’s completely doable because it’s a small, but decently populated city. 

My main social activities are me being at work and going to church on Sundays. I haven’t fully committed myself to online dating because I don’t know how to go about it.
