Not being hired because I'm unemployed
I interviewed for a job on Thursday.  I've been unemployed since August, and have been holding out for a role that I'm interested in and is aligned with my career aspirations and goals. I have a great resume, references from my previous employer, and a work sample that proves I am capable of building complex financial models. I offered all of these documents to the hiring manager and the recruiter emailed me Thursday evening saying the hiring manager really liked me and that they will let me know about next steps.

&#x200B;

Today, the recruiter got back to me and said the company was not moving forward with me because the CFO can't get over the fact that I am unemployed.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have recommendations of how I can try and get around this or a similar story? Offer to work unpaid for a month or two to prove myself? Get a temp job and keep in contact with the company to see if they would reconsider once my temp job ends so I would have another reference?

Anything would help, thanks.
