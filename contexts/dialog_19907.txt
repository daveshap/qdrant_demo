WILLIAM: I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
SPIKE: I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
ANNA: You've got big feet.
WILLIAM: Yes. Always have had.
ANNA: You know what they say about men with big feet?
WILLIAM: No. What's that?
ANNA: Big feet -- large shoes.
ANNA: The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
WILLIAM: You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
ANNA: Definitely. 'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek. In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
WILLIAM: You have a stunt bottom?
ANNA: I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
WILLIAM: Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
ANNA: Definitely. Ths is important stuff.
WILLIAM: It's one hell of a job. What do you put on your passport? Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
ANNA: Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he? It's delicious.
WILLIAM: The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
ANNA: Both.
ANNA: Today has ben a good day. Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
WILLIAM: Well, thank you. Anyway -- time for bed. Or... sofa-bed.
ANNA: Right.
WILLIAM: Oh my God... Hello.
SPIKE: Hello. I wonder if I could have a little word.
WILLIAM: Spike.
SPIKE: I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
WILLIAM: Maybe.
SPIKE: And she's in your house.
WILLIAM: Yes.
SPIKE: And you get on very well.
WILLIAM: Yes.
SPIKE: Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
WILLIAM: Spike. For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
SPIKE: Right. Right. You think it's the wrong moment. Fair enough. Do you mind if I have a go?
WILLIAM: Spike!
SPIKE: No -- you're right.
WILLIAM: I'll talk to you in the morning.
SPIKE: Okay -- okay. Might be too late, but okay.
WILLIAM: Oh please sod off.
ANNA: Okay.
WILLIAM: No! No. Wait. I... thought you were someone else. I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
WILLIAM: Wow.
ANNA: What?
