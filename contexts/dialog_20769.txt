WHEELER: ... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
SEIDMAN: Jesus.
WHEELER: What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
SEIDMAN: Charles...
WHEELER: What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to? What is it, Bob?!
SEIDMAN: Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
WHEELER: Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
KENTON: We ought to be suing him.
