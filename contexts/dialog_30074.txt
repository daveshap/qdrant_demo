ELIJAH'S MOTHER: I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
DAVID: It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
ELIJAH'S MOTHER: He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
DAVID: We are.
DAVID: He's doing well today.
ELIJAH'S MOTHER: I'm very proud of him. He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally. They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
DAVID: He's kind of a miracle.
ELIJAH'S MOTHER: Yes he is.
