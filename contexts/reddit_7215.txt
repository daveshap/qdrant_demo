Contract job: Training-related question
I'm a registered nurse in Canada and recently got a clinical educator contract job. My employer agreed to pay me 4 hours for completing the online modules, but I'm pretty sure it will take me 8 hours to complete all the modules plus online tests (each module and follow up test has taken me 30 min to complete so far). 

I'm just wondering if it's worth bringing up with my employer or whether it sounds like a ridiculous request. I'm asking for double the hours but I'm finding the content from the modules is more medical and pharmacy-related than what I've been taught in nursing school. Should I track my hours and present how long it took me to complete the modules? Or is it assumed that my education should have taught me the content already but the modules act as a review? This is my first time working in a contract position but it looks like I'll be working here for the next two years, so I'd like to keep good relations with my employer.

TLDR: should I ask my employer to pay me more hours for training?
