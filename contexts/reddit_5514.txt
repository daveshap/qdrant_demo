Is it possible to get a job if unqualified by working for a low salary until you can prove your competence
So, I'm a student at last year of high school in Sweden. It's not developing at all and a complete waste of time, I don't gain anything except making my family happy by a false sense of accomplishment. Now I want to do something productive instead, I want to start a company, but to secure funding and sustain a modern lifestyle, I need to have some kind of income as a full time job. I've great understanding of IT and computer related things. I have a basic (in terms of development) understanding of how a linux system works (partitioning, window managers, GNU utils, systemd) and the most common used tools used on the CLI, like cat, ls, grep, curl, git, vim, emacs, systemd, etc. So the most basic job I've found interesting that fits my qualifications is an IT-technician. Sysadmins and alike often require that you can do programming well, which is something I'm not yet qualified for. So now the problem arises that most require a formal education which I don't have. So is it possible to get a position you're not formally qualified for by working for 65-75% the salary of someone who has a formal education. It would be invaluable in terms of work experience, and I'll learn a lot in the mean time. Or is there other alternatives I don't know about which could be a better option, please let me know!
