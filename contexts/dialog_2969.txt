BASQUIAT: Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
ANDY WARHOL: My jacket? Gee, great... Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
ANDY WARHOL: Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
BASQUIAT: Yeah, I met her already.
