Anyone else just wants to fast forward to next year to see what college you’ll end up in?
This process is kinda draining, and I’m excited to just figure out where I’ll spend the next four years of my life.

Edit: This was only in the context of college apps lol. I'll enjoy my senior year; it's just the applying part that I wish I can skip.
