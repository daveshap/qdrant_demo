Can \"from on something\" be used as \"from under something\" is used? I encountered this sentence last night\"Mr. Shin looked up to her from under his head lamp and replied with a simple but empthatic \"yes\" \"I know, if it were the other way around, I could use over, as in \"he looked at her over the top of his newspaper\" but I was wondering if I can use \"from on\" with the word, look, when I want to say I look down from on something, as in \"I looked down at the people from on the skyscraper (or from on top of the skyscraper\" ?
