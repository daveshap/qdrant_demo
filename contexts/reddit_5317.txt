Should I love my job?
So I’m only 15 and im working at a fast food restaurant. I have only been working there for a month and the other workers are getting mad at me because I’m not learning fast enough even though I’ve told them several times I’m a slow learner, but then my trainer told me i need to love working there to learn and said I shouldn’t have came to just make money. I absolutely hate working there and I don’t think anyone seriously loves working a minimum wage job in fast food.

Am I in the wrong to come there to make money and not enjoy working in a oven?
