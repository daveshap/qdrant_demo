PINTA: Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
CREASY: If they like me.
PINTA: Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
CREASY: Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
PINTA: Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
