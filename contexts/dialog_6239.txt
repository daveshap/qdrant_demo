MAX: You like Bach?
ANNIE: I used to play this piece back in high school.
MAX: Let me guess. Clarinet?
ANNIE: Violin. I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
MAX: Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
ANNIE: Different instrument altogether. You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
MAX: Keep it. Go wild. Have a party.
ANNIE: Why'd you do that? Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
MAX: It's no big deal.
ANNIE: No? How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
MAX: There were two of us. I had the other guy killed. Don't need the competition...
ANNIE: You're an anomaly in today's world, Max. You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
MAX: This? Temporary. To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
ANNIE: Like what?
MAX: Travel...and things.
MAX: You like being a lawyer?
ANNIE: You psychic?
MAX: Sure. I'm starting an 800 hotline. Caught part of your phone call. And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
ANNIE: Bottega.
MAX: ...Bottega. Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer. You? Definitely Clarence Darrow.
ANNIE: Not quite. He did defense. I'm a prosecutor...
MAX: Big case?
ANNIE: Yeah.
