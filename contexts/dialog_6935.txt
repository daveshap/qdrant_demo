OLIVER: Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
AMY: Because she is my friend.
ALICE: Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
OLIVER: We've got to go on. Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
AMY: It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
OLIVER: In the garden? Would she be there now?
AMY: She's there whenever I call her!
