Minor anxiety at amazon
So my training is done, got my first paycheck, my second evaluation was “meh”  but the issue that hits my head is that when I’m assigned to the freezer, the PPE is not for my size , and it slows me down, and the there is little to no space to stow stuff and I have told this to the manager but nothing has been done yet. Just told me “use one hand and warm the other” which...It doesn’t feel like good advice. They want us to do 300 Units per hour but I have no idea how to calculate that.  I know it has to be 5 per minute and by 30  mins I have to hit 150  and I’m like...How??? So far it’s been the hardest part of the job, to keep up “these spectations” and the indirects they have of “there’s always someone  behind who can replace you” which just feels that is far the opposite of what the training videos have said. 

I just don’t know if I should quit and look for another job aSAP that pays the same and weekly for the summer because I need the money for my next nursing semester. Is there some advice I can get ?
