MARGE: You really should go in, it's marvelous.
RIPLEY: I'm fine.
MARGE: Are you okay?
RIPLEY: Sure.
MARGE: The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
RIPLEY: So I'm learning.
MARGE: He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
DICKIE: He's drowning me!
MARGE: It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
MARGE: Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
RIPLEY: What about Cortina?
MARGE: Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out -- Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
DICKIE: Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
FREDDIE: I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
DICKIE: Do you think you can steer this thing?
FREDDIE: Sure.
DICKIE: Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
FREDDIE: What are you doing?
DICKIE: Marge-maintenance.
FREDDIE: Aye, aye.
