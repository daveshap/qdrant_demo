MRS. STANWYK: Don't worry, I can take it.
FLETCH: You shouldn't be here.
MRS. STANWYK: I want to hear this.
FLETCH: He doesn't read my stuff well. 'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.' That was stupid, Alan.
MR. STANWYK: I'd have been long gone.
FLETCH: Ahem. 'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
