Making a jump soon (x-post from r/reslife)
Pretty soon I will transition from working at a small private university as a RHD to a large state school RD. I'm pretty confident in my ability to adapt, however, I'm also looking for advice and different perspectives. Has anyone made a transition like mine before? If so, what advice do you have? What did you find drastically different about the transition? What didn't you expect? What worked well for you? And what would you say your biggest success was?
