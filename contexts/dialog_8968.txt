ARCHER: Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
POLLUX: Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass. You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
ARCHER: Uh -- to kill the doctors?
POLLUX: After that. You promised you'd always take care of me.
ARCHER: And I bet I've kept that promise ...
POLLUX: Only one you've never broken.
