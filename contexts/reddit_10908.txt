I want to go home
I want to go home.

Not to a place in my mind I once knew. 

Not to my birthplace, or the town where I grew.

Not to my family that left me alone. 

Not to the land or the house that I own. 

Not to the West where my heart says I should be. 

Not to the places I would one day see.

Not to the bed where I lay down at night. 

Not to my “friends” who stay out of sight. 

Each day it gets harder and harder to stay.

Afraid to tell anyone the things I should say.

My mind has betrayed me like everything else.

I finally realize, I have to do it myself. 

The truth that I find so incredibly sad:

I have no home. Not like I once had.

I am tired. I am weak. I am angry. Alone. 

I have made up my mind...



I AM going home.
