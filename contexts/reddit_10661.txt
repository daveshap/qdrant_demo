Self hatred
Every little thing I do wrong makes me hate myself so much more. I’ve done so much wrong I honestly feel like I’m past the point of no return. I really wish my body could just give up and die on command. 

My life feels like it is so far beyond repair. I just wish I was never born at this point nothing in life has been worth this. I will never be happy, and I don’t know what to do with that information. I want to die but I can’t do anything about it.

I wish I could just do something. I never do anything to try to fix my problems I just make more. I sometimes try to fix something but when it feels like I’m making progress I always take 10 steps backwards in the wrong direction.


I will never get better, I can only move downhill. I could keep typing forever about how much I hate myself but there is no point. I will never do anything about it. I am just a bystander watching as my life wastes away. I guess I should just hope it goes by quickly
