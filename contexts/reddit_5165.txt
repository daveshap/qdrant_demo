Applied today and received this right after I hit submit. I applied as a sales associate, I have no work experience, but from what I've read about in the Q&A section on Indeed, they aren't too picky. The two locations that I applied to are five and six miles away, both set to officially open 9/7, but there are still job listings up. I got this message both times I applied to each location. I though it was because I didn't have any references, so I faked one to see the outcome, nothing changed. The 3rd party used to apply doesn't exactly seem professional, so I'm hoping that this is just an error on their part.
