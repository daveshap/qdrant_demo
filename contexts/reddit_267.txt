Should I leave my loser friend group to pursue my own ambition?
Right now I'm at a crossroads. I'm still a teenager and it's the second semester of my sophomore year. I have a solid group of friends I can laugh with and enjoy. I love them to death but we are all losers. By this I simply mean that when people look at us in a group they know not to hang out with us since we are weird. My best friend decided to distance himself from our group a while back and none of us understood why he would do that just to try to get girls and be popular. He was the best looking out of us and now that he distanced himself he had girls craving for him and now he has a girlfriend and is happy. Since highschool is going by fast I'm starting to realize that I want what he has and I see the problem. However I don't know if I should distance myself from them just to change who I am. I want to keep close bonds with my friends but if I do distance myself they won't like me as much. So any advice because I do want to change likey best friend did before I regret it or something after highschool is over.
