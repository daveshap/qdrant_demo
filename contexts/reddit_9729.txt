HR trends noticed
Hi guys, I've been job hunting for nearly two years now (ICK). I've noticed two strange trends after interviews:
1) some places don't let you know they've gone with someone else. They literally ghost you, after you took the time to interview with them (and apply, and research, etc.) It's disturbing that SAPros would act this unprofessional in such a small field (I wouldn't recommend, for instance, applying to those places, or even going there. And I'm location-bound, so when I do get a job, I'm less likely to trust a place with my students that can't be bothered to send me a two minute email of "thanks but no thanks".)
2) sometimes when I don't get a job, I look back after a while to see who did. I figure it doesn't hurt to see maybe what that person has that I don't. Who I've seen lately getting hired is someone who's 50 or older getting the job, usually without a master's, OR someone who's my age but has absolutely no student affairs experience. 

My questions are: is anyone else noticing these trends? (ghosting, hiring those without experience or education, hiring those who are likely to retire sooner than later). And: what the heck can I do about any of this, if anything? Thanks in advance.
