"We pay you enough"
Recently, I've picked up a part time job to help make ends meet until I move to a new and cheaper place at the end of July. During the last day of classes, I spaced and picked up a shift during the last class I had that semester. Completely my fault, but the class had no final so I wasn't missing a review, and wasn't going to be about any new material so I wasn't missing anything new. A friend of mine said that the prof asked where I was and one of my classmates who thinks before he talks said that I was working. My prof said, in front of the class, "oooooooo I don't like that, we pay our grad students enough". While I know for a fact she meant it playfully, it infuriated me to hear this. In fact, the common grad student issue in my department is that we DONT get paid enough. I've been having a really stressful time making this job work with grad school and hearing that just felt like I got kicked while I was down.
