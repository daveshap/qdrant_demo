I told my husband that I’m not okay
I’ve been having some really low moments lately and had a talk with my husband about some of it. He was really supportive when I said the words “ I am not okay”. He said he’d do everything he can to help , but made me promise I will try to get professional help as well. Later I apologized for losing it, and he said in all seriousness, to never apologize for that. He’s so good to me. I wish I could be whole for him. He’s my rock.
