Bernie Sanders wins Michigan in large polling upset. What advantages and disadvantages does this actually mean for the Democratic primary candidates.
Bernie has officially won the MI primary, he is still down in delegates, and the total delegate count moved more for Clinton on the 8th, than Sanders. 



I'm not sure what actual gains this truly means for Sanders, and on the flip side, does this mean Hillery made some kind of mistake, or was this all because of Bernie supporters work?
