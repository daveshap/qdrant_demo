change home directory only when connecting with FTP I'm working on configuring a vsftpd-server for ubuntu-16.04.2-server.I have set up a working configuration with user restricted access and a restriction on the upper directory, but I still want to change one thing.<br>Instead of being brought to a user's home directory I want the home directory to be different when connecting with FTP, without changing the actual home directory of the user.the directory I want to have set as my home directory is a sub-directory of the home directory of a userThanks in advance, if any other information would be needed, please ask
