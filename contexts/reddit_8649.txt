Where can Assange go to avoid extradition by the US, and how can he get there from the Ecuadorian embassy?
[Sweden has just dropped charges against Assange](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/39973864), so he is no longer at risk of being extradited from Sweden to the US, but [the US has charges planned against him](https://www.rt.com/usa/385508-assange-justice-department-charges/), so he is still at great risk of being apprehended by that government.

* Where can Assange go, and how can he get there under broadly accepted diplomatic conventions (not asking about cloak & dagger), without being apprehended en-route?
* Would he need to go to a country without an extradition treaty with the US, or are extradition treaties specific to the kind of charge or crime?
* Would being granted asylum be the same thing?
