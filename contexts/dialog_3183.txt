DAVID: Uh ... yes ...
BERNIE: Great day. At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
DAVID: Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this. I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
BERNIE: You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love you. . Jesus - what a terrible tie- Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a little surprise for you and the Boss.
