I’m so proud of myself. I just started college. I’m a week in. I haven’t had friends to talk to in person in years. I made 4 wonderful friends and they made me so happy last night.
I didn’t wanna go to this school party/dance event last night.. I don’t know anyone here. Even in high school and my hometown I never had any friends to talk to in person. For years I was alone and only had a few online friends.. 

I’m so glad I decided to fight my social anxiety last night.. I went to the event. After an hour of walking around and standing in the back, I decided to walk over to this small circle that had formed. People were having fun and dancing around. And I ended up sticking around and then eventually one of them said something to me. We started talking and I met the whole group of them. 

Sorry for typing so much lol. I’m just so happy I finally have someone I can talk to in person. It’s amazing and I had a great night. I’m so so glad I decided to go to the event, despite being so anxious and not knowing a soul. This is a huge step for me and it feels amazing. 


**Update:** **She just asked if I wanted to come to her dorm to do homework, I agreed. But I’m instantly regretting this. What have I done.**

**Update 2:** **It was fun. She’s really nice and caring. Even got a hug. My first hug from anyone other than my parents or family in years. Thank you all so so much for your kind words. You’re all amazing!**

**Update 3:** **I’m beginning to worry I’m gonna make them hate me. I feel like I’m so annoying.. I’ve never really had friends in person, other than online friends, and Ive been texting them a lot. They’ve been busy so we can’t talk in person. Has this happened to anyone else? Your mind and anxiety keeps telling you they’re gonna leave and forget you so you have to talk to them a lot and very often so you know they don’t hate you and you can have a little relief? What do I do?.. 


**Update 4 (probably last update):** They we’re just busy. We hung out last night and watched a movie and had fun. Already have plans for Labor Day weekend. I still can’t believe this is happening. This is the best hint that’s happened to me in 3 years. Thank you all so so much for the kind words. You’re all amazing people.
