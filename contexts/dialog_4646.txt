PAMELA: So what's he doing? You believe him?
ABBOTT: It's hard to swallow. The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick. What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
PAMELA: Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission. I want the Berlin police fully briefed and -- -- get this out to all the agencies.
ZORN: Sir...
ABBOTT: Thanks.
