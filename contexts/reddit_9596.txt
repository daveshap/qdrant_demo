Word of advice to student leaders considering a career in SA
Just because you enjoy being a student leader and working with fellow students younger than you (in the capacity of peer mentor, resident assistant, orientation aide, etc.) doesn't mean you'll actually enjoy Student Affairs as a career unfortunately. It's much different and with changes in the field the past half decade or so (I won't elaborate too much on my criticism here to avoid backlash), it's not something I'd recommend for a great deal of people. Just my thoughts!
