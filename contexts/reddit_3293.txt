How can an introvert with teaching and sales experience escape people-centric work and still make decent money?
I taught high school for 3.5 years after college. I just did it because it was a job, not my passion or anything. I left that and went into retail sales and work 100% commission now. I do well; I'm one of the top people in the region, and I might break six figures this year. But realistically it's not a career path, and commissions will only be cut in the years to come, so I need to look elsewhere. I'm a very introverted person and would like to transition into something that does not involve so much human interaction, but all of my experience is heavy on humans.

General information: My degree is a BA in English with a focus on and honors in creative writing, so not particularly marketable. I'm 28, female, and in the Houston area. Sometimes I consider doing postbac studies in something computer related, and while I imagine I would become good at it, I do not have any relevant experience, and my work schedule doesn't play well with any other obligations.
