DANA: What do you want with my baby?
JANOSZ: No harm will come to the child. You might even say it's a privilege. He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo. And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world. Doesn't that sound nice?
DANA: If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
JANOSZ: I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
DANA: Everybody has a choice.
JANOSZ: Not in this case, my dear. Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
DANA: I don't care who he is. He's not taking my baby.
