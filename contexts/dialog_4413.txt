MOM: Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'.
BOTH: Yes mother.
MOM: I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry. My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
MOM: Promise me boys.
MURPHY: We promise.
CONNOR: Yeah, we promise.
MOM: Well, there's my boys. Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
MURPHY: All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
CONNOR: Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
MOM: Still bickerin' over that, huh?
CONNOR: Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
MOM: All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
MOM: Are ya ready?
BOTH: Aye.
