I think some mysteries are meant to stay unsolved.
I’m definitely a curious person, curiouser than most, so I’ve always been obsessed with anything pertaining to the unexplained and unknown. My mind has always been my safe space. I didn’t have a lot of friends growing up, so I was alone with my thoughts mostly. Any rabbit hole I could find to lose myself in, well I dived head first. If there was a van that instead of saying, “Free Candy” the van would say “Free Trip To conspiracy land and 2 free passes to Abandon Places Everywhere Land, and Drive yourself insane with no sleep unsolved mysteries treasure hunt land.” Well I already had signed permission slips with both my parents signatures on the witness line ready to go. No brainer, I would be already in the back seat bitching about the drivers cringeworthy taste in outdated one hit wonder bands. 
But hears the thing, somethings I don’t necessarily think we should mess with. Especially in the last few years, I’ve read about how so many researchers, anthropologists, and archeologists are getting more and more curious about things that don’t need to be unearthed. Case in point, the search for Cleopatra and Mark Antonys tombs. I understand it’s a piece of history, they were still people who died and were laid to rest in peace. What if one day people just decided to start digging up yours and your family’s graves In the name of whatever mainstream media is claiming it’s for? Leave the dead undisturbed, and for the love of my sanity stop destroying the discoveries that you do unearth.
