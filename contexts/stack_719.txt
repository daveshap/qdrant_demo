New user is unable to Rdp. When trying to use RDP to access a Linux VM a new user is unable to connect.  It seems to authenticate the same as I do, but then the screen is simply blank.  Do we need to do something else to his account on the VM to allow RDP?  Add him to the group that was created perhaps?I am able to connect fine, and I tried using the new user credentials and get the same results so it is not system related.I am using Ubuntu 16XrdpAnd xfceThis machine is on Azure
