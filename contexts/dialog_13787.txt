WIGAND: Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
LOWELL: Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously. Where do you work?
WIGAND: Did work.
LOWELL: Did work.
WIGAND: How much would I get paid?
LOWELL: That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
WIGAND: Should I just take the documents now?
LOWELL: If you want to do it.
