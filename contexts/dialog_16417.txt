DOROTHEA: Bad show last night?
SWANN: The usual. Full house. Standing ovation. I tell them it's magic...
DOROTHEA: ... they believe you.
SWANN: Yeah. Remember Quaid?
DOROTHEA: Sure.
SWANN: Somebody killed him.
DOROTHEA: Oh God.
SWANN: I just saw him.
SWANN: I'm putting in a new illusion tonight. Will you be there?
DOROTHEA: Sure. You want me to find out about Quaid? I mean, the funeral?
SWANN: No. I'm not going near him.
