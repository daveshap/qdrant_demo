PSA to you lonely redditors out there: it’s better to be lonely than to settle
I’m posting this because I’m lonely. But I’m happy to be lonely. I was in a relationship with someone who I ultimately settled for because I was just so lonely and I wanted to know what it was like to be “in love” and to have a long lasting relationship.

But I was wrong. I thought I was in love, I tried to convince myself I was in love.. but I wasn’t. I watched the other couples in my life and I knew deep down that we didn’t have the same love they did. They fit perfectly together, always sat next to each other, were protective of each other. Sometimes I would even forget my SO was in a room. I would compare him to other guys. And I felt so so guilty about it but I told myself to push down those feelings. And I did for a long time.

When I finally got the courage to break it off I felt like the worst person in the world. I felt selfish. I felt disgusting. But I had to remind myself that I’m a human being. And sometimes it’s okay to sort out your feelings and act accordingly.

But I also felt free. I felt like I was giving myself the opportunity to find real, true love. The love people write about. I want that for myself. Right now I’m lonely, I miss what I had with my SO, being held and told I was loved. But I’d rather be lonely and looking than loved and settling. I’d rather go on 1000 crappy dates trying to find the one for me. I’d rather agonize over asking someone out and wondering if they like me. 

Because at the end of the day, no one deserves to settle. And no one deserves the kind of love someone gives when they are settling. 

So I’m writing this to let all of the lonely people out there to know: don’t settle. Loneliness sucks but trust me, settling is so, so much worse. And love is worth the wait.
