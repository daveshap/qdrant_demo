UNCLE BILLY: I can't wait to see the pictures.
TED: It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
UNCLE BILLY: Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
TED: Seriously? I'm doing all right?
UNCLE BILLY: You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this stuff" spoil you."
TED: I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
UNCLE BILLY: I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
TED: Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
