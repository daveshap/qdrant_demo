STANDARD: So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.

STANDARD: The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
ROBY: Are you <u>crazy</u>?
STANDARD: The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
