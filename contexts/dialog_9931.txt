VICTOR: I've loved you all my life
ELIZABETH: All my life I've known.
VICTOR: This feels... incestuous.
ELIZABETH: Is that what makes it so delicious?
ELIZABETH: Brother and sister still?
VICTOR: I wish to be your husband.
ELIZABETH: I wish to be your wife.
VICTOR: Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
ELIZABETH: If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
VICTOR: Only you.
ELIZABETH: I will be here when you return.
