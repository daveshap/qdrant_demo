RENEE: I thought you were getting me a drink?
FRED: Just a minute.
FRED: Andy, who is that guy?
ANDY: I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
FRED: Dick Laurent?
ANDY: Yes, I believe so.
FRED: But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
ANDY: He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
FRED: I don't. I don't know him.
ANDY: Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
