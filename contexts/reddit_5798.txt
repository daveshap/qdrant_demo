What should you be doing between graduating and getting your first job?
I recently graduated in July, and have had the interviews and such, but my life seems extremely dull outside of that. I especially feel like I am falling being the competition because Iâ€™m not used to not being at school. I have been trying to keep my skills up to date (messing around with Python and C++ as I graduated in Software Engineering). What are your suggestions for that downtime between graduation and the first job? Also, what did you guys do to earn money during this time? I feel it would be disrespectful to go get an easier job i know I could get, and then turn around and leave once I get hired in the Software field, if I do.
