MILES: Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
WOMAN: He tricked you. With a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He got you. You married Marylin, didn't you? You thought she had money. HA HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard all about it. My brother Howard Doyle got you. Neener neener neener.
MILES: He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
RUTH: Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
MILES: He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
RUTH: I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
MILES: Did Marylin end up with money?
RUTH: She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
MILES: I don't have a pre-nup
RUTH: ...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
MILES: Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
RUTH: And it's good!
MILES: I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
RUTH: Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
MILES: ...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
RUTH: That's attorney client privilege. Sorry, Miles. But as a great and clever man once said, What's good for the goose --
MARYLIN: Hi.
MILES: Hello Marylin.
MARYLIN: I have a surprise for you.
MILES: I bet.
