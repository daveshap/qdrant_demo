JACK: The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
MILES: Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
JACK: The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
MILES: Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
JACK: I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
MILES: Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
JACK: Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
MILES: How do you know?
JACK: No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
JACK: Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
MILES: Shut up.
JACK: She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
MILES: Have you no shame?
JACK: Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
MILES: Fuck you.
