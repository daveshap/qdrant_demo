For my job interview, my boss gave me $8000 and wants me to deposit it into my bank account, then transfer over to another company, is it common?
I applied for this job as an office assistant, and my boss told me he wanted me to do several tasks as a test. One of which is he sent over an $8000 check and told me for helping out I could keep a couple $100s, then send the rest to another company. 

I think it's incredible I literally just semi-joined, and he's trusting me with that much money, esp how certain potential employees could probably just run off with it. I normally want to keep a decent reputation if I can so I don't and also just out of personal values, but I haven't heard of a job interview doing something like this as a test, is this a common thing? Should I be wary or is it totally legitimate and okay? I looked up the company and they have a website and all and seem pretty legit, so was hoping to grab an opinion?
