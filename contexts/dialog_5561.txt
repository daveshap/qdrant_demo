JUDE: What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
FERGUS: Leave me alone, Jude.
JUDE: No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
FERGUS: I heard.
JUDE: Eddie and Tinker died.
FERGUS: I know.
JUDE: Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
FERGUS: Suits you.
