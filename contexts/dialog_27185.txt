KAWAKITA: Got to finish this thesis sometime.
MARGO: How about lunch?
KAWAKITA: Not today. Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
MARGO: Okay.
MARGO: Dr. Frock?
FROCK: Look who's here, Margo.
MARGO: I'm so glad to see you. What's the occasion?
PENDERGAST: I'm in town on a case. Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
PENDERGAST: Dr. Frock, I was wondering. What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
FROCK: They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
D'AGOSTA: Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
FROCK: The virus itself might have positive applications. They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made. Greg isn't joining us?
