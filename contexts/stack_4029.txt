UK transit visa (Sri Lankan holding Schengen student visa ) I'm a Sri Lankan national. I'm currently doing my M.Sc. in Norway. So I have a Schengen Student visa (temporary resident permit) which I renew every year.My question is that if I want to transit via London Heathrow without entering the UK do I need a transit visa? Because the www.gov.uk site does mention that there are exemptions for people with long stay visa (Category D Visa) in EEA countries. I couldn't find any information about my specific situation. Is my Schengen Student visa (temporary resident permit) a category D visa which qualifies for transit in the UK without a visa?Thank you!
