I just unfollowed my ex on all social media
Checking social media the past couple months has caused me so so much anxiety, I was constantly afraid to see his face pop up on my screen, because I guess it was my last tie to him. Last night I finally unfollowed him! Iâ€™m proud of myself but still sort of sad


Edit: THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH!!! The supportive comments have really brought peace of mind to me and honestly after the initial anxiety, I feel a sense a freedom
