JIM: Jesus. What, I live in a palace, right? I have guests here.
AGENT SIMS: Understanding the following rights...
JIM: Speak with my lawyer.
AGENT SIMS: So you refuse to answer my questions?
JIM: Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake. I have people here.
AGENT SIMS: Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
JIM: This evening is over.
AGENT SIMS: And your former wife.
DIANE: Mom, please?
MRS COURT: Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest. I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
DIANE: This is me telling you about me.
MRS COURT: You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
DIANE: I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
MRS COURT: If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier. You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
DIANE: If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
MRS COURT: Alright.
DIANE: You will?
MRS COURT: Okay. Oh, here's Ray. Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
