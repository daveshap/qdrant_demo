How to get back job offer taken away by COVID-19?
Looking for some advice for my partner in how to secure (or resecure I guess) a job.

Prior to COVID-19, my partner applied for an amazing job with a multinational company that was a significant promotion from her current title and a key step in her career goals.
Following the interview, they decided to call her no longer that 1 hour later to say that she was a perfect applicant and they would even increase the salary by several grand per year over the listed remuneration on the ad.
Obviously she was ecstatic about this offer and accepted almost immediately and was due to start in roughly 3 weeks time and completed the required pre-employment medical that week.
Whilst waiting for the results of the medical to reach their hr team, covid came along and changed everything. The company overnight enacted a total hiring freeze. Her medical came back flawless and a contract was written and was meant to be getting mailed to her that day, but ultimately due to the new policies this role was no longer available.
The role was never formally rescinded and the hiring manager continued to assure her that they were working on it for over a week before all contact was dropped.

A month or 2 has passed now, and given job uncertainty in the near future we would love to try and find out if this role is still available and ultimately if they'd still be interested in hiring her.

So herein lies the questions,
How would you approach the company to find out if the job offer is still available? What would you even say? 
Would it still be acceptable to ask for the same offered salary particularly given the current climate?
