How can I escape MS word purgatory??!!??
Hello all-
I have reached my fill of dealing with MSword while writing my dissertation.  The problems started when I added chapters 1, 2 and three together in one document. It now takes for ever for the document to load, and I have not even started to add my figures and tables yet.  I am really hoping for some suggestions on another app to use that is more focused on dissertation writing. I know a little bit about Scrivener and LaTex but looking for some direction and input from those that have/are currently using apps.
Does anyone have some words of guidance to give me a direction to go?
thanks
