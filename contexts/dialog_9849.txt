FORD: Uh, nice piano. Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh... It's another time, Julian, another place. If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
GRENDEL: Shock.
FORD: And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
GRENDEL: Golly, I'd probably faint.
