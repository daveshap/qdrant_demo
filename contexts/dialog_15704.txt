BRIGHAM: Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
CLARICE: Where?
BRIGHAM: Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
CLARICE: I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
BRIGHAM: Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
CLARICE: Sometimes.
BRIGHAM: He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
