WILL: But she was an attractive girl.
WALTER: I suppose.
WILL: Did you have sex with her?
WALTER: No.
WILL: But you wanted to.
WALTER: I was a mentor to her.
WILL: You gave her gifts.
WALTER: Yes.
WILL: Expensive dresses. A heart necklace.
WALTER: Yes.
WILL: Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
WALTER: I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
