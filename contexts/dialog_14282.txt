MAX: Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
ANITA: I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
MAX: But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
ANITA: I know. That's why I went.
MAX: But then you told her you were home.
ANITA: Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
MAX: I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem. Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
ANITA: I understand.
MAX: I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
ANITA: I understand.
MAX: Then say Yes
ANITA: Yes, Max, I understand.
