Daily breakdowns. TW: suicidal ideation and self harm
I'm a 17 y/o trans man. I have anxiety, depression, ADHD, and am a victim of sexual assault. I've been out as trans for 2+ years and in that time my family has done next to nothing to accept me. They stand firm on use of my birth name and female pronouns, regardless of how much it upsets me. I spend atleast an hour a day having a breakdown from this.(sometimes much more) I've considered suicide more than I'd care to admit. I have to force myself not to cut. I'm stuck and feel like it wont get better.
