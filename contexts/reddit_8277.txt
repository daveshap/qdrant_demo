How sound is the assertion that any particular act of violence is at its core a "mental health issue"?

Following the shooting in Las Vegas, the President [said of the shooter](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/stephen-paddock-donald-trump-las-vegas-sick-demented-man-shooter-terrorist-latest-a7980686.html), 
> "He was a sick man, a demented man, a lot of problems, I guess. And we're looking into him very, very seriously, but we're dealing with a very, very sick individual."

And yesterday, after the shooting in Texas, President Trump [commented](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/06/this-isnt-a-guns-situation-says-trump-after-texas-church-shooting)
>“We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries, but this isn’t a guns situation …  This is a mental health problem at the highest level."

Researchers Wehring and Carpenter in [*The Journal of Psychoses and Related Disorders*](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/37/5/877/1911614) agree that "In public perception, schizophrenia is often associated with violence," but I am unaware of any informed psychiatric position that attributes acts of mass violence such as shootings to observable pathology. Are there any? 

Is there a sound factual basis for the President to assert that mass shootings are "mental health" issues?
