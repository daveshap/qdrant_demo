SCARECROW: Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
TIN MAN: Oh! Well, what happened to you?
SCARECROW: They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
TIN MAN: Well, that's you all over.
LION: They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
SCARECROW: Don't stand there talking! Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!

LION: Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
TIN MAN: Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.

TIN MAN: Now, now, don't fret.
SCARECROW: Oh, dear, dear.
TIN MAN: We'll get you together!
