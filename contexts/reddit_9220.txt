Property is so expensive and unattainable for many, but I pass abandoned houses every day. What are some clever ways of getting these properties into the hands of people who need them - for cheap?
First let me say that I'm not talking about crazy schemes, or the long term and risky process of claiming squatters rights here.

I'm looking for realistic ways to get unused housing into the hands of the people who need it. 

I'm coming from a background where I struggled for 14 years to get my own home. After the 2008 recession my country (Ireland) was hit hard, and as a self employed person I could no longer get a mortgage despite having good credit and savings. This severely limited my budget and options. In the end only by pure luck did I manage to track down the owner of an abandoned and derelict house (through Facebook) and managed to buy it for half the price of the next cheapest property in my area.

One year later, and a having expended a huge amount of time and effort, the property is mostly restored and my young family finally has their own home. Everyone in the community is happy because their village has had an eyesore removed, and it feels like I've had a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I finally have some stability in my life that renting could never offer.

But I know I was incredibly lucky, and many in the same situation will not find a similar opportunity.

So what can be done? Are there any registers of abandoned properties in your area. Any ways to find out who owns them and get in contact? Scheme's or grants for restoring buildings that are derelict or eyesores in the community?

I'd love to see resources made available to the people who need housing - connecting them with properties that need love, but that may also be more affordable because of this. 

Can Reddit help some people find their forever homes?
