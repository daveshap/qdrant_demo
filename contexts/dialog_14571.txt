JACKIE: I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
MIKE: I'm not sure I can.
JACKIE: It'll be fun, come on!
MIKE: Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
JACKIE: No way. Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
MIKE: That's not it. My dad told me not to go.
JACKIE: You do everything your parents tell you?
MIKE: No.
JACKIE: Good. I'll be on the dock at eight. Eight o'clock, everybody!
