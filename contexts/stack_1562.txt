What are the limitations of the USB Composite device I am looking at coding a USB device that is capable of encapsulating two USB devices. I would like to create a HID keyboard with a single extra USB port. A mass storage device would be connected to the port.I was wondering, would I be able to program the keyboard to register it as a composite device encapsulating the mass storage and the keyboard?My current thought process is to declare the keyboard as having 2 interfaces. I was thinking of simply copying the USB commands from the mass drive into one of the interfaces of the keyboard. Is this possible?If this is incorrect thinking, please let me know what the data formatting of the interfaces is suppose to be. Thank you.Also, this is for educational purposes to expand my knowledge of USB.
