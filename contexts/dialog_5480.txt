THEO: Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions. We're almost there. Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
LENORE: I'm not leaving my daughter behind. Not with them.
THEO: She's next. In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
LENORE: I can't do it.
THEO: Don't start thinking about it. Is the tape off?
LENORE: Yes.
THEO: Can you walk?
LENORE: Yes. But I want Rachel to come with me.
THEO: They won't allow that. It's one at a time. And you have to be first.
LENORE: Why can't it be her?
THEO: She's a child. She might panic. She doesn't know me. She might not come to me. She might just run.
LENORE: All right. Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
THEO: Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
LENORE: I'm sorry. You've thought this out better than I ever could. I'm ready now.
MALE VOICE: I'm opening the side door. She'll step out. But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view. If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
THEO: Are you trying to panic the women?
MALE VOICE: That's how it is. You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
THEO: I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
LENORE: Rachel -- Oh my God.
THEO: Just start walking. Come on. Walk to me.
