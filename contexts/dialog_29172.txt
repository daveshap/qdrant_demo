WOLFMAN: Well, I don't know. That depends.
GIRL: On what?
WOLFMAN: Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
GIRL: Like what?
WOLFMAN: Oh...I'll think of something.
ICEMAN: Figured it out yet?
MAVERICK: Figured out what?
ICEMAN: Who is the best.
MAVERICK: Nope.
ICEMAN: Need a hint?
MAVERICK: I think I can work it out on my own.
ICEMAN: You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
MAVERICK: I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
ICEMAN: And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
