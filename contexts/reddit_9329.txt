Why is it that when I have more money, money has lesser value to me?
All my life, I have always been broke. Three months ago, I received $10,000 and it totally made a big difference in my life. I didn't touch the money. It's still in my savings account and I hope it stays there longer. Anyway, one thing I notice is that...money doesn't seem so important to me anymore now that I feel a little secure. Maybe it's a good thing but I remember that when I was so broke, I was so grateful...with every meal, every gift, every little thing I have day to day. Now, it's just meh...but a good kind of meh for sure. I don't know what I want to say. I'm all over the place. But maybe I want to know more about this phenomenon I'm experiencing just out of curiosity and so I would know how to motivate myself more. Do you know money psych theories and articles that I could read? Thank you.
