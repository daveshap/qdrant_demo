Learning the hard way: make my resume CLEAR
I just want to share my story and help others to prevent them making the same mistakes as I did. 

Few weeks ago, I got called in for an interview (through networking), it was a very well paid job. Coming from an hourly-base, minimum wage job, it was like a dream job for me. After 1.5 hour of conversing and talking about myself, we finally part ways. Right before we did, he mentioned "Out of our 16 candidates, I haven't seen anyone with your qualities; you did very well in the interview today, and I am going to have my recruiters reach out to you ASAP. 

Fast-forward, 23 hours later, he personally called me. He sounded pissed. He questioned about my resume, why did I put X, Y, & Z (I don't know why he didn't see this before), and it was a bit misleading. I spent 30 minutes explaining myself, and also I made a simple mistake on my application. Now I think he is questioning about my performance. 

Good luck with job searching out there!

TL;DR: Didn't get the job because my resume was unclear.
