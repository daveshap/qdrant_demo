JORDAN: So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each. 'Cool? How much air in yours?
MCCOOL: Maybe half. Not even.
JORDAN: Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it. Cortez, help him. Flea? You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
CORTEZ: What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
MCCOOL: O'Neil. Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there. You know that, don't you?
