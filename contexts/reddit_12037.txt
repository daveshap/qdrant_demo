I hate work. I hate working. Why can't people understand this?
No, I'm not excited about my new job. I don't want to wake up at 9 AM and sit in a cubicle all day. It's not exciting, it's stressful, it turns my stomach in knots, and I don't want to do it. 

And now when people say "Congrats on the job" they're going to think I'm an asshole because I'm not happy about it. I like having my own time. I like not doing anything all day. It's not that complicated.
