How can I accept that my GF likes to party..
So i'll try to keep this short, i'm not the guy that likes to go out and party every week. But so does my girlfriend (not every week), and everytime she's out drinking i'm worried she'll drink too much and do something stupid with another guy. 

Now this makes me feel bad everytime she goes out and i even have a hard time just hearing about when she tells me about the parties. I have always been worried for these silly reasons but i honestly dont know how to stop worry..

Is there anyone who feels the same or can help me anyhow? I cant help how i feel but deep down i should not worry.. Hope my English was good enough, thank you guys.
