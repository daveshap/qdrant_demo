OLEG: In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
EMIL: The one who got caught in the bathroom. George Michael.
OLEG: I'm serious.
EMIL: Shut up. Look!
OLEG: This is my project. I say 'action.' I am the director! You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.' And 'action!'
EMIL: Bad last moment - I cut it out.
EMIL: I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
OLEG: Be quiet. Watch.
