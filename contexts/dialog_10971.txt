NARCISSUS: Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting: if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
PROXIMO: On you! Of course! You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
NARCISSUS: Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth. Take my advice and make that bet.
PROXIMO: Oh, shit. Take your time! Don't get suckered! This man is a murderer! In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators. Please, just take the fall!
