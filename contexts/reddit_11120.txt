I have a confession
When I was a sophomore in highschool I put down a bunch of wrong answers on my American History final because people were cheating off of me. After they turned their tests in I changed all my answers and got a 100.

Just felt like I had to tell someone

Edit: I should probably state that I didn't put down enough wrong answers to make them fail, just enough to knock their grades down a bit.

Edit 2, electric boogaloo: there are a lot of cynical people in the comments, almost thought this was ifunny for a minute
