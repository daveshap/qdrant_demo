TALLEY: That would be the girl who opened the door. Are the others inside?
ANDERS: The mother is in Florida visiting her sister. The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
TALLEY: Louise?
LOUISE'S VOICE: Go, Chief.
TALLEY: Get a phone number for the Smiths.
MIKKELSON'S VOICE: Chief, Mikkelson.
TALLEY: Go, Mickey.
MIKKELSON'S VOICE: The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two. He has an Agua Dulce address.
