FANUCCI: I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat. I'm right. Only two hundred dollars.
VITO: I'm a little short. I've been out of work. Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
FANUCCI: Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before You're too quiet for your own interest. I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable. No hard feelings, eh? If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
