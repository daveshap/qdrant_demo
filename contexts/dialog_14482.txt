HENDRICKS: Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
BRODY: Get out of there â€“ take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
HENDRICKS: What's the matter with my printing?
VAUGHN: What have you got there, Lenny?
HENDRICKS: We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
VAUGHN: Who've you told this to, Lenny?
HENDRICKS: I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
VAUGHN: Take my car, okay? You come with us, Lenny.
HENDRICKS: I've got all these signs here...
VAUGHN: C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
