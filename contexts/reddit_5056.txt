Has anyone ever received a strange job rejection email?
I applied to a position at a local business weeks ago and since they never responded I figured I didnt get the job and I moved on. Today I received a rejection email from the company and I figured it was just the normal rejection email until I opened it. 

The email started like a basic rejection email, but then they went on to describe how great the person they ended up hiring was. They literally described their career background, how much more experience they have, and even the type of degree they have! Instead of being annoyed I started laughing at how ridiculous the email was. It was sent by the owner and I wonder if they realize how unprofessional they sound. That was definitely the weirdest rejection email I have ever received. I'm glad I didn't end up working there.
