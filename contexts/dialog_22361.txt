GREGOR: Whoever hired us.
SAM: I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
SAM: So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
GREGOR: Now that is an interesting proposition.
SWEDE: How so?
GREGOR: Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides. Your orders might be different from mine.
LARRY: What're you talking about, man? I don't understand.
SWEDE: What a surprise...
LARRY: I got a surprise for you, blondie...
