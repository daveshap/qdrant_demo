My stay-at-home mom of 20 yrs wants to start career - which path (nurse or teacher)?
Hi all, hope this is an appropriate sub for this.

My mom wants to go back to school - she is 42, she's been a stay at home mom/housewife for over 20 years. No college degree. She's likely divorcing my dad in a few years...and will need to have a career/income/life of her own.

I'm hand-holding her through this whole process because she's overwhelmed and of course I'd do anything to get her where she needs to be. We're torn between two career paths for her - teacher or nurse.

The way I see it, teacher = 4 yr degree, testing, then employment at an elementary school - she loves children, the hours are pretty nice, summers off, decent benefits. Yeah, teacher salaries are pretty low, but she'd only be supporting herself. I'm a substitute teacher and I think it is so rewarding and fun and I know she'd be great at it, she agrees.

Nursing is something she's been vaguely interested in for a while, and she could get an Associate's in nursing, start working, and work on her Bachelor's while she does so. The money is about the same between teacher and ADN, but better if she has a BSN. Other than that idk much else about nursing. Personally I wouldn't like working in a hospital poking people with needles but she thinks she would love to work maybe in midwifery/maternal/neonatal care.

I am trying the best I can to lay out a very detailed timeline of what EXACTLY she needs to do to pursue either of these, starting with testing, pre-reqs, admission to a degree program, and everything leading up to employment, and the lifestyle with it. 

Anyone have advice for my dear later-in-life student mother? :)
