Is there really a skills gap/labor shortage in the (skilled) trades?
I realize this may be difficult to answer. However I was hoping someone in this subreddit might have some insight. I think we have all heard how the skilled trades are in decline and that people are needed desperately in these fields: plumbing, electrician, pipe fitting, various mechanical technicians etc. I think you get the idea. Mike Rowe, from Dirty Jobs, has been championing the skilled trades fairly heavily. He even has a website for it. 

However, I have heard numerous statistics about this situation. One is that there is a shortage now. The other I heard is that there will be a big (Bigger?) shortage in the next 5-10 years because (apparently) the average age of these workers is quite old. I was reading the average to be in the forties and fifties. Thus, I wonder if the claim is more geared towards the future than now. Mostly, I wonder why so many people have not jumped on the skilled trades road to employment. I imagine many people are saddled with school debts and are reluctant to do more school. Of course, the skilled trades is still school and it costs money. I think this could be the main reason and I think breaking into these fields is more difficult that it sounds. However, with all the unemployed, it seems like more people should have jumped on this awhile ago or maybe not.  The economy started to get bad in 2007 and 2008. If people started a 4 year degree in that time, they would have graduated only a couple years ago. So its feasible most people just didn't know about the skilled trades (like me) and are only figuring things out too late.

For me, I will be debt free soon. I live out of the USA right now. I'm considering what I'm going to do when I get back.
