How Do I Choose My Career If I'm Not Passionate About Anything?
I'm 16 and in high school that specifically focuses on mathematics and science. That means extra maths, computer science, and physics. I chose that high school because I wanted to push myself a bit. I have two more years to pass and then I get to decide on what faculty (or collage/uni) I'll choose.
I've been thinking of some paths but I realised that nothing really interests me deeply. I don't want to choose a career based solely on income. I don't want to feel miserable for the rest of my working life, either.
Does anyone relate and how did you choose your career paths?
