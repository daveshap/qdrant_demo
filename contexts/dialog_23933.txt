SHERIFF COBB: Easy, boy. Just an idea.
PADEN: Well, thanks, but forget it.
SHERIFF COBB: You know, Paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. The fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. It's going to take a little straightening out. I have my responsibilities. I want you to understand. It has nothing to do with us.
PADEN: What is it you want from me?
SHERIFF COBB: Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
PADEN: I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
SHERIFF COBB: So we understand each other?
PADEN: Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
