BREE: All right. Loneliness. Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten. Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
SPANGLER: Don't belong?
BREE: Do you always have to repeat?
SPANGLER: Sorry.
BREE: Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
SPANGLER: You think people hate you.
BREE: The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money. All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together. Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
SPANGLER: Didn't want you.
BREE: I said that. Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or -- So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it. And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is. And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
