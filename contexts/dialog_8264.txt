HANA: Excuse me. Yes? I don't have the key to that door.
KIP: The Germans were here. The Germans were all over this area. They left mines everywhere. Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
HANA: I see. Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach. He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
KIP: Is something funny?
HANA: No, but, no, not at all. I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and - - such good manners for someone worried about mines. That's all.
KIP: I've met you before.
HANA: I don't think so.
HANA: He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him. He's Indian, he wears a turban.
THE PATIENT: Sikh. If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
HANA: I'll probably marry him.
THE PATIENT: Really? That's sudden.
HANA: My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
HANA: I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
THE PATIENT: Why? Is he staying?
HANA: With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy.
THE PATIENT: We should charge! Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
HANA: They have to clear all the local roads of mines. That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
THE PATIENT: In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
