CATHY: We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
MITCH: That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie.
MELANIE: If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
LYDIA: Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
MITCH: Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
CATHY: Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
LYDIA: Yes, I did.
CATHY: Just listen to them!
MITCH: Some cream?
MELANIE: I'll get it.
