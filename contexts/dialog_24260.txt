KARL: Yes sir.
VAUGHAN: So, you're really going to stay here?
KARL: That boy wants me to.
VAUGHAN: Did you knock on the door yet?
KARL: Naw, I ain't.
VAUGHAN: How long have you been standing here?
KARL: Quite a spell, I reckon.
VAUGHAN: Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
KARL: I done et just a little bit ago.
VAUGHAN: I mean tomorrow or the next day.
KARL: I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
VAUGHAN: Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
