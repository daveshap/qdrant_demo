how do you motivate yourself to write cover letters?
Hey y'all!

I'm at a low point right now. I've been struggling with some burn out symptoms since I worked on my Master thesis this January, went through a horrible dating experience, moved from a different country to my parents, and now job search is killing the last drops of my motivation. I have been a very fun-loving and life-affirmative person, but lately the job market does not make it easier to find motivation for cover letters.

I tailor every letter to the position, I research about the company and their values, I adress that and I double check it's the right person etc I am writing to. I went to a training for writing letters and she said I write really nicely (German is my native language). But after rejections and no answers (that is the most annoying part) I have zero confidence and motivation to write another cover letter for an institution that does not care how much effort I put into every application and doesn't even consider me as an applicannt. What should I do? Should I write heartless, standardized cover letters? 

I am applying for jobs that suit my profile (e.g. done internships in that area or wrote a thesis in that field etc), it matches my skills etc. So I don't get what their problem is? 

How do you keep up your motivation for writing cover letters? Any tips on how to change my perspective on it? 

Thanks!!
