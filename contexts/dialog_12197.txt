JAKE: No.
NIKI: Huh?
JAKE: Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
NIKI: You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
JAKE: I don't drink, but you can go out.
NIKI: You don't drink?
JAKE: Ulcers.
NIKI: You're not a private detective either, are you?
JAKE: No.
NIKI: I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
JAKE: A friend.
NIKI: Of Joanne's?
JAKE: Yeah. I'm her father.
NIKI: Jesus.
JAKE: Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
NIKI: And your wife? Where's she?
JAKE: She's dead.
NIKI: Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
