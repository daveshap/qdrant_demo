How to use Mac Keyboard, on iPhone, with lightning cord? I am looking for a way to type on the Mac keyboard and have it type on an iPhone. I know there are many bluetooth Apps to do this, but I am using a typing script and bluetooth does not transmit the keys fast enough, hence why I would like a way to do this with a lightning cord.Shouldn't really matter but I am on:macOS High Sierra &amp; iOS 11
