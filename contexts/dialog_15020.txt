MALCOLM: Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour. You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
KELLY: I don't even know this woman.
MALCOLM: Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right. You're going to have a fantastic time.
KELLY: Stop saying fantastic. Where are you going?
MALCOLM: I can't tell you. But I'll be back within a week.
KELLY: My vacation is over in a week.
MALCOLM: I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
KELLY: I'm your daughter all the time, you know. Not just when it's convenient.
MALCOLM: Very hurtful. Your mother tell you to say that?
KELLY: No, Dad. I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
MALCOLM: Is that kid still bothering you?
KELLY: Which one?
MALCOLM: You know, at the bus stop. With the hair?
KELLY: That was about a year ago.
MALCOLM: Well, is he?
KELLY: No. Richard talked to his parents.
MALCOLM: That Richard.
KELLY: I could come with you.
MALCOLM: Out of the question. You'd miss the gymnastics trials. You've been training for that for a year.
KELLY: I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you. I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
MALCOLM: This is nothing like Austin. Forget about it.
KELLY: You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
