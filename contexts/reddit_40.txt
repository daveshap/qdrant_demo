Dont know what to do about this girl
So I'm in 10th grade and in 8th grade I met a girl who meant the world to me. She became my best friend and eventually I developed feelings for her. Unfortunately I'm a very insecure person and I became scared that she was using me as a way to stop herself from being bored. I was scared that she was only talking to me to not be bored but I was too scared to confront her. Instead of confronting her I stopped talking to her completely and I waited for her to confront me. I thought that that would be my only way of talking it out because I was too scared to confront her. Eventually we did talk things out but things were never the same. The worst part is that she had developed feelings for me and was gonna ask me out before I ghosted her. I felt like shit because I hurt the most important person in my life and I missed my one shot at true love. One day I asked if we were still friends and she told me we were but she just hasnt been on social media as much. I responded to that by telling her I felt shitty that things would never be the same and she didnt respond. After that we never spoke again and she ended her social media break so she was back online posting. After months of hoping she would talk to me I blocked her and prepared to end it completely. Eventually I unblocked her but didnt follow her again but the feelings still havent left me. We havent talked in almost a year but my feelings for her are still haunting me. I want to follow her again and try to patch things up but I'm afraid that she thinks I'm a piece of shit and it's not gonna work out. I know this whole situation is happening because I'm an idiot and I did something stupid but I still love her. I dont know what to do or how to fix things and seeking advice here is my last resort.
