GREER: What's slow?
EPPS: Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
DODGE: Where from?
EPPS: Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
GREER: Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
DODGE: I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
GREER: Greer to Murphy.
MURPHY: Go.
GREER: The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
MURPHY: Of course they did.
GREER: Let the buyer beware.
MURPHY: What do you say, Dodge?
