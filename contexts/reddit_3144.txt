Are there any careers for me? 30 y/o physically limited and extremely introverted
I have dropped out of school like 4 times because of my shyness/anxiety. Besides that, I hate it worse than anything. I'm sick of wasting my time studying bullshit. I never want to go back. I'd like to learn a trade, but I have physical limitations. I can't bend or twist and I'm not supposed to lift more than 50 lbs.

Are there any respectable jobs out there that I could possibly do? People laugh at me when I tell them my current job (janitor) and it hurts my feelings, maaan. And tbh, even though I'm an introvert, it's too lonely. I live alone, so I can go an entire work week (starting at 6PM after everyone else I know gets off) without seeing a single person.

I like programming, but I'm not very good at it and I don't think I'd ever be very good at it. I don't think I'm particularly bright. If I were being honest, I'd guess my IQ is something like 90-95. (I know that's "normal")

I've considered getting dishwasher job and maybe become a cook, but I'm not sure if anyone would be willing to teach me.

Does anyone have any other ideas?

BTW, I'm not trying to be rude to janitors.
