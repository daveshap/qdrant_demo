TAKSTER RINPOCHE: Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
TENZIN GYATSO: Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: I do.
TENZIN GYATSO: I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
TENZIN GYATSO: We cannot.
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
TENZIN GYATSO: Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
TENZIN GYATSO: How could I ever leave?
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: It may not be your decision to make.
