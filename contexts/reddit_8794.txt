In response to chemical attacks in Idlib, Syria, Donald Trump stated "President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a 'red line' against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing." What evidence supports this conclusion?
Donald Trump's [official statement](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/04/middleeast/idlib-syria-attack/) on the tragic chemical attacks in Syria that killed approximately 60 people are as follows:
> 
> "Today's chemical attack in Syria against innocent people, including women and children, is reprehensible and cannot be ignored by the civilized world," US President Donald Trump said, adding that he thinks the attacks was a consequence of the past administration's weakness and irresolution. "President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a 'red line' against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing."

With regards to the last sentence, is this accusation supported by facts? What evidence supports or contradicts the assertion that the usage of chemical weapons is attributable to inaction by former President Barack Obama?
