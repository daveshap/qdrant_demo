After three years of searching I finally found her. My soulmate.
Three years after my divorce I have finally found the woman of my dreams. My soulmate.

I tried every dating app out there and went on countless failed and awkward dates. Just as I was about to give up and call it quits I matched with this amazing woman. 

After chatting for a few days I could tell there was something there. Chatting led to lengthy phone conversations that cemented in my mind that everything about this is right. When we finally went on our first date we already knew we were meant to be together. Now we begin planning the rest of our lives together. 

Donâ€™t give up hope. Exercise patience and wait for the right one. I had sworn off dating apps for a period of time. I just had terrible luck with them. Dead end conversations and terrible dates that began out of desperation. I decided to give it one more shot. Months of nothing but a couple dates that were not going anywhere. I was about to delete my accounts again but somehow convinced myself to have a little more patience. So glad I did.
