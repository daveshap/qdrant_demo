ARCHER: Where am I?
SASHA: My place.
ARCHER: You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
SASHA: Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
ARCHER: I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything. I'm glad you've stayed clean.
SASHA: Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing. At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
ARCHER: I'm not the same person you remember.
