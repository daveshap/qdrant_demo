ALLISON: Now, I'm getting interested. I want to know more ---
PARRISH: We've got some things to discuss.
DREW: -- Did I hear 'business'?
SUSAN: What 'business'?
QUINCE: Don't bother asking, we already tried.
JOE: It's so very nice to see you again.
SUSAN: Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
PARRISH: Cut it out, Susan. You and I've got to talk. Big day tomorrow, everybody. Joe, let's go.
