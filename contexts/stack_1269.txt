Should the ground lug be bonded in my sub-panel? I have 200 amp service at the house.  I want to install a DP 60 amp breaker in that panel and run # 6 wire approximately 150 feet (10% added for swag) overhead to a dog rescue building.  The building will have a window AC installed (7.8A@208V), plus a number of 20\" box fans (0.8A each) , and LED lighting for a 480 square foot building.  The AC unit is the only thing pulling a significant amount of power.  It is my understanding that the grounds and the neutrals need to be separated.  Does that mean I should not install the bonding screw which I think is meant to tie the ground and the neutral together?  Next, can I run 6/3 without the additional ground as long as I sink 2 grounding rods at the sub-panel, at least 6 feet apart?  This is not my house!  The sub-panel (which had been fed by an extension cord) is either from HD or Lowe's (Homeline?).  It has a factory installed 100 amp main breaker which does not appear to be replaceable.  Since the main panel has a DP 60 amp breaker this 100 amp breaker will basically be a switch to kill the sub-panel.  If I use AL wire for the 150 ft should I drop the breaker in the main panel to a 50amp?
