How we can monitor the network traffic of logs transferred through the rsyslog I'm consolidating the client logs to a centralized server in Ubuntu using the rsyslog deamon. While consolidating the logs, how can i see the amount of network traffic or file size transferred from the client to server?Is there any way i can do filtering from the client machine before transferring the logs to server?
