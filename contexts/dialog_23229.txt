MILLS: Well, that was money well spent.
SOMERSET: Let's go.
SOMERSET: By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
MILLS: It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
SOMERSET: It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth. The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
MILLS: Him?
SOMERSET: For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
MILLS: What? Assessing fines?
SOMERSET: They monitor reading habits. Not every book, but certain ones are flagged. Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf. Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
MILLS: You got to be kidding.
SOMERSET: Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
MILLS: How is this legal?
SOMERSET: Legal... illegal. These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
