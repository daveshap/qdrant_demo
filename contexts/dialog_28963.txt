SUMMERS: A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
ANYA: Montana?
SUMMERS: Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance-- --and now gosh darn it--Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world."
LOTHER: You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
SUMMERS: Eh?... Oh.
LOTHER: He works the boats as a come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself."
SUMMERS: There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly. I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
