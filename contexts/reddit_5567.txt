How to break into AML?
Hi all,

I just graduated in May with a Bachelors in Criminal Justice and I am currently a Paralegal at a small firm. I am really interested in breaking into the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) field. I have about a year of law firm experience and another year in accounting for a start up company. 

My question is how to I make the transition? I was reading about the CAMS (Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist). I think that this would help set me apart from the pack. The downside to this is that itâ€™s about $2k to get the certification. Is it worth it? Are there better/cheaper resources to break into this field? 

Also, where are most AML jobs located in the US? I currently live in CA but am willing to relocate.
