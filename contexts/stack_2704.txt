Overlay raster above uploaded shpfile but behind background? I have a .shp file of the world oceans (hydropolys.shp) and create a map with it in QGIS, so the background of the image is the land. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can overlay my raster output on top of the oceans, but not overlain on the land? So I essentially want my image overlain on top of the uploaded .shp file but underneath the background.
