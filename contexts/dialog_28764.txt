RAY: Do they come in dreams, these visions?
CROW HORSE: Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
RAY: Just before we caught Jimmy... I had a dream that I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.
CROW HORSE: Where was this?
RAY: At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
CROW HORSE: You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
RAY: Well, it was just a dream, I --
CROW HORSE: Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
RAY: What do you mean?
CROW HORSE: Nothin'. Forget it.
CROW HORSE: You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
RAY: Sorry.
CROW HORSE: I'm a full-blood Oglala.
RAY: We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
CROW HORSE: Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
RAY: Yeah. Fitful dreams.
CROW HORSE: Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
RAY: What the hell do you want me to do?!
CROW HORSE: Stop.
RAY: What's that?
CROW HORSE: Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
RAY: Jesus. Oil?
CROW HORSE: Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
RAY: 1868...
CROW HORSE: What?
RAY: That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
CROW HORSE: We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
RAY: Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
CROW HORSE: So they took care of Leo.
RAY: Listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.
