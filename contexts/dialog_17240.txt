HOT LIPS: There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
FRANK: No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond. But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
HOT LIPS: I have a tent to myself.
FRANK: People will talk.
HOT LIPS: I don't mind. If we give them something to talk about.
HOT LIPS: I think it's a marvelous letter.
FRANK: We're a good team.
HOT LIPS: We think the same way.
FRANK: It's supper time. But you're not hungry are you?
HOT LIPS: Ravenous. What about you?
FRANK: Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
HOT LIPS: Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
