PALM: Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
BOBBY: You're lucky no one was hurt.
PALM: Seven hundred dollars, down the toilet! I'd like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out! Can you give us a lift?
PALM: Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
RAYETTE: Jesus, what a rude person...
BOBBY: What's your name?
PALM: Palm Apodaca.
