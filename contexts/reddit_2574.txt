Which companies did not retract job offers due to covid-19?
A few days ago I received the news that my job offer for a business dev position from a fairly large IT firm (\~$4B annual revenue, >10K employees) had been retracted.

does anyone know which companies have not retracted their job offers and/or what positions?

TYSM! -- would been great to know, now that like many others I'm back on the search in a terrible job market

take care everyone, hope ya'll staying safe (physically and job-wise)

\*\* thanks for your comments! hoping fewer people have to go through the same experience.
