Too many units to change majors?
I'm a student at UCI that transferred from a JC last year.  I'm wanting to change majors and meet the general GPA requirements, but I've been denied for two listed reasons:

-I have too many units

-I don't have a particular class that completes the general intro classes for the major


I explained that I was willing to go back to a JC to get the class I needed and reapply, but was told that probably wasn't an option since I already had too many units.

Why is having too many units a bad thing?  Do I have any other obvious options that I'm not seeing?
