DECKER: The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?
ILIA"": Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?
DECKER: Yes.
ILIA"": Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.
DECKER: What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
ILIA"": Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
DECKER: Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
ILIA"": More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
DECKER: What does that mean?
ILIA"": When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
DECKER: Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.
ILIA"": That is logical. You may procede.
