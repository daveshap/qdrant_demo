RIPLEY: Is Mr Greenleaf here?
MACCARRON: Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
MARGE: I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Tom.
RIPLEY: Hello, sir. Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Marge has been telling us about the rings.
RIPLEY: You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous.
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
HERBERT GREENLEAF: I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
RIPLEY: We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
HERBERT GREENLEAF: No, he should talk to you alone.
RIPLEY: I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it?
MACCARRON: I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
RIPLEY: Okay.
MACCARRON: Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
