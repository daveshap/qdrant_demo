SHERIFF: Where ya goin'?
BOBBY: Harlin's.
SHERIFF: Get in.
SHERIFF: Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today. You're not planning on staying are you?
BOBBY: No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
SHERIFF: That's a nasty cut you got there.
BOBBY: Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
SHERIFF: There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
BOBBY: Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
