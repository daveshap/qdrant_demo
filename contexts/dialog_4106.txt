DIEGO: If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
GEORGE: What?
DIEGO: Your offense? Why are you here?
GEORGE: I don't want to talk about it.
DIEGO: Intriguing. I see. Would you like to know my crime?
GEORGE: Not really, no.
DIEGO: No?
GEORGE: I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
DIEGO: Me, too. Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good. But we are roommates, okay? And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars. For the grand theft auto. Okay? So, now it is your turn. Now you will tell me, okay? You will tell me why you are here?
DIEGO: Oh, come on, George. If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
GEORGE: Murder.
DIEGO: Ah, yes. The murder.
GEORGE: What do you got there, Diego?
DIEGO: Nothing. Just a little project.
GEORGE: What kind of project?
DIEGO: Never mind. Not for you to worry.
GEORGE: I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
DIEGO: You have your intrigues. I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne. In nine months, I am free. How much time do you have?
GEORGE: Twenty-six months.
DIEGO: Twenty-six months? For murder? I must be your lawyer.
GEORGE: I've got to get out of here, Diego.
DIEGO: Only two ways I know to leave here early. One is to escape.
GEORGE: What's the other one?
