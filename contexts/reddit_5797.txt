When you are unemployed do you tell your family and friends?
I have been unemployed for almost 9 months now and I have not told any of my friends about it. I feel guilty about it, but I feel that telling them will be an even bigger blow to my already low morale. 

Also, I don’t want to tell my mother who is my native country. She has health problems and this news might just make them worse. It’s a heavy burden, but I just don’t have the courage to do so. Do any of you tell your family and friends when you are unemployed?
