JEFFREY: And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
JEFFREY: I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and. . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
JEFFREY: I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Is Sandy part of this?
JEFFREY: No. not at all.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Who knows you have these?
JEFFREY: Only you. and the photo lab.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: You're all through with this now?
