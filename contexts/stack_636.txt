How to restore Ubuntu in a new disk I have a dual boot system with windows 10 and Ubuntu. I would like to backup and restore only the functioning Ubuntu into a new disk,without windows. How should I proceed? I have used clonezilla and backup only the partition of Ubuntu but after restoring it, it didn't boot: I believe because I didn't backup the right partitions or copied the grub or whatsoever. Ps, I'm not an expert.
