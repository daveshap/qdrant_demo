Finding a someone in person rather than online.
Is it just me or is the act of finding a significant other much more thrilling when it is done in person rather than online? I've used apps before to get in contact with women but I've never actually felt like I 'earned' their attention. It was as if I used the internet as a cheat code to get where I wanted with very little effort.

Part of me just loves that feeling of going through the motions of finding that right woman. From mustering up courage and getting to know her,  all the way to making the first move and asking her out (if she's receptive).  I do fear rejection but at the same time its prospect of that which makes me cherish the potential companionship even more. 

What is your opinion?
