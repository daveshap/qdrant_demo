Fantasizing about Suicide because it helps me cope.
I fantasize about suicide often. I do it because when I'm fantasizing about how I'm going to take my own life, I dont think about all the other negatives in my life. It's become like a form of meditation for me. It makes me feel calm. Like I finally have control over something.
I've come very close to doing it befor, but held back because I still have some people that love me and responsibilities to those people. But it has gotten more and more tempting as time goes by. The fantasy becomes a plan. And eventually, plans become reality.
