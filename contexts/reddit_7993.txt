What does a GA position entail financially?
Hi! I recently got accepted at BU, which is my top choice and is also a very expensive private university. I am looking at GA positions to help me fund my education but the financial aid office just responded with the generic answer when i asked them that question. What does a GAship mean financially for students at private universities? Does it automatically come with a tuition waiver?
