HARDY: We don't need the tapes --
DUNBAR: Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
HARDY: We've found all of them.
DUNBAR: Ohhhh, I don't think so...
OSBORNE: How do you know that?
DUNBAR: Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
HARDY: Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun --
DUNBAR: Jesus!
OSBORNE: Hardy, what are you doing --
HARDY: Isn't this how your story goes?
