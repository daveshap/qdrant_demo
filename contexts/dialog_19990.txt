ROSA: Were you with him this whole time?
BETTY: Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
ROSA: You still in love?
ROSA: Does he know you think he's real?
BETTY: He is real.
ROSA: Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
BETTY: Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
ROSA: No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
BETTY: To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
ROSA: Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
BETTY: Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
ROSA: I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
ROSA: This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
BETTY: No, almost never.
ROSA: But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him! Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
ROY: Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
BALLARD: That's a nice name for what you need...
ROY: Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
BALLARD: Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
ROY: What about it?
BALLARD: Any idea where it is?
ROY: Little place called Williams
BALLARD: I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night. Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
ROY: I know plenty.
GEORGE: She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience."
LYLA: I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
GEORGE: She's even taken a job as a nurse! David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
LYLA: We know that...
GEORGE: Can I have an evil twin?
LYLA: No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
GEORGE: Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy? Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
LYLA: I don't know, George...
GEORGE: I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
LYLA: I'll think about it.
GEORGE: It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
LYLA: I said I'll think about it.
GEORGE: Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
LYLA: Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
GEORGE: Hmm?
LYLA: Would you like ground pepper on that salad
GEORGE: ...yeah.
CHARLIE: So you believed the bartender. Why?
WESLEY: Well... I think I saw her soul.
CHARLIE: That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying. First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
WESLEY: I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
CHARLIE: No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
WESLEY: Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
CHARLIE: What doesn't?
WESLEY: You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
CHARLIE: I never said that I believed...
WESLEY: No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
CHARLIE: 'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
WESLEY: I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
CHARLIE: You need to remember who you're talking to...
WESLEY: I need to get my goddamn head examined. You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
CHARLIE: Wesley...
WESLEY: It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!"
