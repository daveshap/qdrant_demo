MOM: Jesse, please, let's talk about this!
JESSE: I'm okay. Just leave me alone.
MOM: He needs professional help. I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
DAD: Are you nuts or something? What the hell is that going to do?
MOM: I don't know! I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
