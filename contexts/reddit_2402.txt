How is it true that full-time office job is the ultimate goal of all these years of studying?
I'm sorry if this post may come off as depressing, but it seems that I have been living in my shell for so long, that I stopped understanding some basic stuff.

The thing is, I just landed my first full-time job at quite good IT company.

During my years of studying I never worked or even had an internship due to personal related health issues.

However, now, here I am, and I am in some state of shock.

How can it be that after all these struggles and years of studying - this office full-time job IS the ultimate goal that about which we should dream and fight to reach?

How can anyone willingly sell 5/7 of their lifetime away... just, I don't know, sitting at desk, sharing stories with colleagues near cooler and all this stuff?

I'm also experiencing some anxiety-related physical issues right now, so that may be clouding my jugment.

It's not that I don't want to work. I realize that is absolutely neccessary part of life. I always loved studying, doing stuff... It's quite okay to me to spend most time of the day just working hard.

However, this inflexibilty, having to sit at my desk from 9 to 6 even if there is nothing noteworthy to do... It just drives me crazy.  


So, can anyone share, why having a full-time office job is.. good?
