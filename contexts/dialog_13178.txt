SEAMUS: Your daughter's been taken.
MAURA: What!
SEAMUS: I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me. I've been here before to cast evil from this house. The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals. It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
WILL: So what does that have to do with Aubrey! Where is she!
SEAMUS: We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
WILL: What are you getting at!
SEAMUS: I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me. I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there. It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
