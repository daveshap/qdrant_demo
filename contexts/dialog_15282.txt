LORD DARROW: Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
ANN: I photographed it extensively, father.
LORD DARROW: Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
