Is it weird that HR/my supervisor hasnâ€™t reached out to me about my internship ending?
Hi,

My internship was supposed to end sometime soon, but no one has reached out to me yet. Instead, I will be reaching out. Is this strange/not normal? I understand that with COVID-19 things might be a bit crazy.
