KAT: I think that’s disgusting.
KAT: Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
NICK: That’s right. Imagine facing it alone.
KAT: Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
NICK: This happened to you?
KAT: Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
