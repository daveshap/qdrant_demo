MARIE: No... How?
BOURNE: The Telegraph office.
MARIE: But we were so careful.
BOURNE: We pushed it. We got lazy.
MARIE: But you're sure?
BOURNE: He was at the campground yesterday.
MARIE: So...
BOURNE: It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
MARIE: That's crazy.
BOURNE: No. Not this. This is real. And he's right there...
MARIE: Where --
BOURNE: Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
MARIE: ...but you're not -- you're not sure...
BOURNE: We can't wait to be sure.
MARIE: I don't want to move again... I like it here.
BOURNE: Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
MARIE: -- where's left to go? --
BOURNE: -- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
BOURNE: You drive.
MARIE: What?
BOURNE: Switch! You drive!
MARIE: -- where? -
BOURNE: -- make the left -- toward the bridge --
MARIE: Jesus! -- -- is he back there? --
BOURNE: -- not yet --
MARIE: -- it's just him? --
BOURNE: -- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
MARIE: -- hang on --
BOURNE: You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
MARIE: Where are you going?
BOURNE: I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
MARIE: What if it's not who you think it is?
BOURNE: If he crosses the bridge, it is.
MARIE: There must be another way!
BOURNE: I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
MARIE: Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
BOURNE: There's no choice.
