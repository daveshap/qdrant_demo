KATHY: You must be Erica.
ERICA: Uh huh.
KATHY: I'm Kathy.
KATHY: Is your dad here?
ERICA: He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back. Would you like come in?
KATHY: So, are you having a good time on the Island?
ERICA: Not really. It's pretty boring.
KATHY: That's only because you don't know where to go. You like hiking? Fishing? Sailing? What do you like?
ERICA: Boys.
ERICA: Do you like my dad?
KATHY: Of course.
