Tips On How To Succeed As A Cashier?
Yesterday I had an interview for a cashier position at a grocery store, and I actually ended up getting it! I have not yet had any training, the manager told me in about a week I should begin training. I know I’m going to learn everything I need to know during training, but I still want to do a great job beyond what they teach me. Any tips on how to be a great cashier? (In case you’re wondering I’m 19F and this is my first job ever). I’m pretty excited, but I’m also super nervous because I have social anxiety, I’m hoping this job is going to help me change.
