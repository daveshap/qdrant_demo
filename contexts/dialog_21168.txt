BRANDON: All right, let's see the buzzer.
MAN: What's a buzzer?
BRANDON: So you're not a cop.
MAN: Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
BRANDON: Who told you my name?
MAN: I've got good ears.
BRANDON: How are your teeth getting along?
MAN: The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
MAN: What's this in favor of?
BRANDON: I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
