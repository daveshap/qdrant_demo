BOBBY: Hi. It's Ruiz. Yeah. So the driver knows where to go? When? We'll be down in five. No, I'll tell him. He's right there. Bye.
RICKY: What's up?
BOBBY: He wants to see us now.
RICKY: Where?
BOBBY: He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
RICKY: We're getting whacked.
BOBBY: We're not getting whacked.
RICKY: Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
BOBBY: It's not a 'sit down.' He said he's telling us the plan.
BOBBY: What are you doing.
RICKY: I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
BOBBY: You gonna shank him in the shower?
RICKY: Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
BOBBY: We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
BOBBY: Put that shit out...
RICKY: C'mon, man...
BOBBY: I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
RICKY: Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
BOBBY: Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
