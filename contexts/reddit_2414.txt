How the heck do people decide what it is they want to do for the rest of their lives?
It's such a strange concept to me. When we're dumb hormonal teenagers at 18 we're forced to make a decision that will affect the rest of our lives. I stupidly went to school for history because I really had no clue what I wanted to do. To make matters even worse, I went right into a masters degree in it afterwards, as a means of delaying 'real life' for two more years (though I didn't admit that to myself at the time). Now here I am, out of university without a clue what it is I want to do. I'm not really qualified for much, anyways. I tried admin 9-5 type work briefly but was extremely miserable. 

How do people make this huge decision? I'd be willing to go back to school to get some actual applicable skills, but I just have absolutely zero clue what would be appealing to me.

EDIT: For everyone telling me to just try a bunch of new positions, I've been trying to do this, and have sent out over 500 applications to a wide range of industries, with zero callbacks. Employers here aren't willing to take a risk with an untrained new hire, and most entry level positions require at least 3 years of experience.
