I'm fucked
AMA.  I need to be an open book because keeping things inside have ruined my opportunities, relationships, and life in general.

Long story short, I've been depressed and had suicidal thoughts for over a year, flunked out of one school and about to be on probation on the one I'm at now.  I handled depression terribly, not even going to see a doctor for the first 9-10 months or so, despite my ex's encouragement.  I went from 3.8 GPA in highschool to getting kicked out in one year, and that kinda blindsided my parents.  The feeling of disappointment pretty much killed me for the next 3 months.  Now I'm going to have to feel that way again, as well as they probably won't let me try to fix things next semester.  If so, I can't blame them.  Nobody but me would fuck up two semesters the way I did.

I don't know why I stopped seeing the doctor.  I guess when my mom said she thought I was feeling better I felt it would make her happy if I said I was rather than disappointing her, even though that way I might have been able to deal with it.  

Might as well add some more shit to this.

-Have one friend who lives near me I talk to occasionally, a couple others I only play online games with.

-Only dated one person ever, pretty clueless and have nothing to offer in a relationship.  (Of course when I fucked things up so badly this is currently the least of my concerns)

-Honestly I don't even know how to make conversation with people, even my friend who I used to talk with for hours.  I quite often go an entire day without using my voice.

-No ambition to do anything.  The only thing I do is distract myself with shows and games so that I'm not thinking about wanting to die or something.  My mind races so I spend pretty much every waking moment avoiding real life.  This is an absolutely terrible lifestyle, but I guess I just took the easiest way out.

-I was an entirely different person two years ago.  I used to have hobbies and do well in school, and I used to be a human being.  People knew who I was, and I enjoyed life.  That's something I can't really say anymore.

-The last time I was overall happy was over a year ago.  The end of last march I went on a vacation with friends and my then gf.  The day after when I returned to school was the turning point where everything went downhill.  

I got carried away, probably should have left details for any questions anyone had.  

Feel free to ask anything

I want to go back to a doctor and try therapy this time

Otherwise I don't know what to do.

I want to try again, like go back to graduation and this time I could handle it better.  Or maybe just get in the car and drive away.  That would be better than offing myself but still hard on my mother, besides, I'd be just as fucked wherever I went.


e:  Thank you everyone who has helped with this, your contributions are greatly appreciated.
e2:  I think I might be able to break from this problem in some time.  There's still the big issue of school and my parents, but I think if that goes relatively well (they let me go back to school) I can break free from these issues with the help of a therapist and self improvement.  I think I'm ready to turn this around; it's just that I hope I didn't already ruin that opportunity.

Thank you guys so much.
