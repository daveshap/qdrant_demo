GUS: Now...when do I get a taste?
ROSS: I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
GUS: Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody. 'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
ROSS: Is this blackmail?
GUS: Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
ROSS: Is this whitemail?
GUS: Fair's fair.
ROSS: What do you want?
ROSS: A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans. Blueprints.
ROSS: For what?
GUS: A computer.
ROSS: We've already got some.
GUS: Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
ROSS: You designed it?
GUS: I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
ROSS: What will it do?
GUS: Everything.
ROSS: What will it get me?
GUS: Anything.
ROSS: Tell me more...
ROSS: That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
VERA: Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
