THE MARQUIS: Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
COULMIER: Your words drove Bouchon to --
THE MARQUIS: For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
COULMIER: An innocent child is dead.
THE MARQUIS: So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
COULMIER: It's no secret that you loved her.
THE MARQUIS: Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
COULMIER: I saw the longing in your eye --
THE MARQUIS: -- that was lust --
COULMIER: -- the passion in your heart --
THE MARQUIS: Don't confuse one organ with another --
COULMIER: I know, because I felt it myself --
THE MARQUIS: I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
COULMIER: AND DID YOU?
THE MARQUIS: IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
COULMIER: You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
THE MARQUIS: Go to hell!
COULMIER: Why was it you never took her by force?
THE MARQUIS: Who's to say I did not?
COULMIER: Was it impotence?
THE MARQUIS: NEVER!
COULMIER: Then it must've been love --
THE MARQUIS: I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
COULMIER: We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
