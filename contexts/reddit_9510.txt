Remember a few months ago when someone posted that you can make quick cash by selling plasma? Well, I did it and here's how it went.
**TL;DR:** Donating plasma is real - it's legit.  It takes some time out of your day, but is otherwise low-effort.

A few months ago (maybe over the summer?) someone posted that selling plasma could get you some quick cash.  Ever since then I've been meaning to do it, but kept putting it off.  Finally, I decided that the new year was a great time to stop procrastinating.

The first thing I did was a quick internet search to find out which facilities were near me.  There are two in my area: CSL and B Positive.  I didn't have a lot to go on, so I randommly chose B Positive.  It's a little bit far from my house, but very close to work so I thought that might be convenient.

I went to the B Positive website and read all the FAQs and informational pages.  I'm glad I did because there's some paperwork you have to bring with you.  You will need: a photo ID, your social security card, and proof of address.  I couldn't find my SS card, but according to the website you can also bring your W2 or 1040.  I brought my 1040 and had no problems.

The website said that first time donations take about 2.5 hours.  I arrived at the facility at 9:30 am on Saturday morning.  I needed to leave by 12:30, so I thought that would be pleny of time.

When I got there, the place was cclean and brightly lit.  The other clients were a bit rough around the edges, but I don't know what I expected - a bunch of brain surgeons and fighter pilots?  Anyway, the staff was super nice.  The front desk lady looked at my ID/paperwork and set me up as a donor.  You have to have your fingerprints taken electronically and they take your picture.  

Next you go to a computer kiosk where you log in via a finger scanner (hence the need for fingerprints) and your DOB. You have to answer a series of 52 questions.  If you've ever donated blood, the questions are really similar.  If you've ever had sex with someone who had sex with someone who had sex for drugs, in France, with Ebola while getting a tattoo with a dirty needle, you can stop reading now because they're going to reject you.

After I answered the 52 questions, I waited to be called for my physical.  This is the part where I didn't plan ahead.  It took a loooong time.  It was a busy time of day, and I waited like an hour.  Finally, I realized I wouldn't be able to finish before my 12:30 deadline, so I had to leave.  I did come back later in the afternoon, though, and it went much quicker.

So, when I came back I had to answer the 52 questions again at the kiosk, and then waited a much shorter time to be called.  My "physician or physician's substitute" took me to a private exam room and did the usual weight, blood pressure, temperature, etc.  She did a finger prick and had to get a tiny tube of blood to check my iron, protein, and something else I can't remember.  She asked a million questions, a lot of them repeats of the 52 kiosk questions.  She marked my finger with some invisible blacklight ink, and explained that the other place, CSL, marks a different finger - so they'll know if you're trying to double-donate.  She checked my arms for "bruising" (aka track marks), checked my eye dialation, felt my stomach, and asked my favorite question - "Do you want a snack?"  Well heck yeah!  So I got some pretzles and a Powerade.  Then I had to listen to some guy read 23 statements about the process of donating and answer "Yes" that I understood.  That part made me feel good because I know some of the other clients are probably not the strongest readers, and by listening to the information it was assured that everyone had access to it.

Before I left that room, the physical lady gave me my Visa card and explained how to set it up and everything.  **HERE'S THE BEST PART:** they pay you according to how much you weigh and fat people get more!!!  My time has finally come!

FINALLY, I got to go back to the donation floor.  It's a giant room with rows of recliner-ish chairs.  They kind of reminded me of those zero-gravity lawn chairs you can get.  The chairs each had a USB port and a plug, so you could use your laptop or charge your phone.  There were also big screens throughout the room in case you wanted to watch TV.  I'd say there were about 40 seats?  The whole thing looked very dystopian, but very clean and legit.

I was directed to a specific seat and the person in charge of that section came over and prepped me for donation.  They verify your name and DOB.  YOu can choose which arm you wan to use - I gave from my left the first time.  They rub you down with iodine and then jab you with the needle.  It was a slight pinch, but not painful at all.  Then they start the machine running.  You have a blood pressure cuff on and while the cuff is tight you're supposed to squeeze and release your fist - that's when the blood is coming out.  When the cuff loosens, you don't have to squeeze any more - that's when the leftovers are getting put back in.  The machine cycles through the whole time you're hooked up.  Once you're done, the person removes the needle and puts some gauze on the site (at my place they wrap it liek a hundred times with bright tape, so if you like attention you can definitely get some!)  The they make you sit up for a few minutes and drink another Powerade.  Finally they let you get up and leave.  The donation part probably took an hour all together on my first try.

From start to finish the staff was **incredibly** nice. 
 Afterwards I felt perfectly fine.  I did drink more water as per the instructions, but didn't have any problems.  Later that night I checked the Visa card balance and sure enough there was 50 buckaroos on it!

That was all on Saturday.  Today I went for my second donation after work.  I went straight to the 52-question kiosk and that checks you in.  Your name appears on a big screen in the waiting area - like an arrivals board at the airport.  I didn't wait long at all, then went back for a mini-health screening (weight, temp, blood pressure, finger prick, check your fingers with a blacklight and re-mark you.)  From there I went to the donation floor and got hooked up.  Today it actually took 2 hours from start to finish, but I don't think that's typical and I'm pretty sure it was my fault.  I think I moved my arm and jostled the needle so I was less "flowy."  People who came in after me finished before me.  My best estimate is that you can probably get in and out in a little over an hour.

All in all, whoever wrote that original post was right - donating plasma is easy and you get cash money. AND you're helping someone who really depends on it.  There was a poster in the donation room that said it took 1200 donations per year to treat *one* patient with hemophilia.  That's crazy!
