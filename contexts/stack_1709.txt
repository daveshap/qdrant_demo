How to properly use an OPB917BOCZ photoswitch? I am building a weather station with an anemometer. I have an OPB917BOCZ photoswitch on-hand that I would like to use as the tachometer if possible. However, I can't seem to have any luck with it.The device has five leads: anode, cathode, GND, Vcc, and output. From the diagram it looks like the anode and Vcc can be hooked together, same with GND and cathode. I tried the reverse as well (cathode and Vcc; anode and GND). I tried measuring the output with a multimeter, but I cannot see anything. My father suggested that it generates pulses and doesn't simply open a gate, so I tried measuring those pulses with a DSO but I don't see any pulses either. He has used one of these devices successfully for a similar purpose, a tach for a spindle on a CNC lathe. He has it wired the same way I tried. Why can't I measure any output? I am getting pretty frustrated. Any suggestions?Thanks.
