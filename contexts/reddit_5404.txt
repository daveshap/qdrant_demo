Why do companies feel that hiring people is more than just asking for their help?
A person being hired is asked to help with the company workload and I know why that is so but beyond that I am not sure at all. I mean the first reason why people are there is because of the need for manpower like if I need someone to build car for me but I cannot do it alone I will search for people and as long as the people I find is willing to help do it I will have no complain with anything else they want to do but that is not the case with companies. But instead on top of helping them with what they want, they also demand so many other things of their workers and there are so many demands and I do not feel that all of them are absolutely necessary or primary. If I get a person to help me build a car I am paying them to build a car for me is that not it otherwise without paying them they could just decide freely if they want to help or not like how friend and family sometimes feel that they are not able to assist you at times.
