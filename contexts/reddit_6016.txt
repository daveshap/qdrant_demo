I'm back at work after being furloughed due to COVID-19, and the anxiety is getting to be too much. What can I do?
(In Canada/British Columbia!) I was laid off of my retail job in March, and then brought back a little over a week ago. My anxiety is just building higher and higher as the days go on - none of the customers care, no one's respecting social distancing, and I feel like the safety procedures put in place aren't as good as I was expecting when I agreed to come back. I'm on my second day off and I honestly feel sick to my stomach at the thought of needing to work five days in a row starting tomorrow.

I would quit if I could, but there are no jobs where I'm currently at because COVID and I can't afford to just quit without another job. I don't imagine I would be allowed to go back on CERB, but honestly, if I knew things would be like this I would have asked to be furloughed for longer - people are being so horrendously inconsiderate to the safety of others, especially employees. Does anyone have any advice or ideas for what I can do? I know this is a vague post with probably no solution, but I just don't know what to do and I feel terrible.
