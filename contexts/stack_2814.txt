Where does induced charge come from on conducting sphere? Suppose we have a neutral conducting sphere and we bring a charge $q$ near it. There is an induced charge on the conducting sphere (the integral of the surface charge density is nonzero). But where does this charge come from? How is this possible if all the charge must be on the surface (since it's a conductor) but the net surface charge is originally zero.
