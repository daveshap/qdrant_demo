Am I selfish? Any advice
Hello again! I started this friends with benefits type with this new guy at my school. (Found out my old crush has a gf) and He recently confessed that he liked me.  He is super sweet and very different than most guys. So on Valentine’s Day I gave him a stuffed animal with some chocolates and he gave me homemade cookies, But...they were all smushed together and it was really sad looking. I’m just kinda upset about it since I showed him my love on that specific day. is that selfish to say even though I’m not trying to be? Am I asking for too much? I just didn’t feel loved at all and it seems like he’s the only one getting happiness, not me...please help
