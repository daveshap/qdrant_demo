LULA: I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
SAILOR: Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
LULA: Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
SAILOR: It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
LULA: What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
SAILOR: He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
LULA: How can you say that, Sailor?
SAILOR: What makes sense, is all.
