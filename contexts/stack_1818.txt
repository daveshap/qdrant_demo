A word for someone who shallowly emulates someone/something they wish to be like (but not tied to fads/popularism - not doing it fleetingly) To detail further; I'm looking for a word for someone who makes shallow attempts to be like someone or something they like or admire by doing nothing more than acting out the perceived actions, whilst making little to no effort to understand the deeper knowledge that facilitates those actions.Basically a top-down approach to things, rather than a comprehension-based climb.A good (possibly offensive) example might be the sorts of nerd-types who wear fedoras in attempts to be a 'gentleman' and invoke the kind of respect that goes along with it without understanding the finer points of what else actually creates that 'look' or description.
