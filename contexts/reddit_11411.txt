I build overly strong connections with fictional characters.
I've had depression for most of my life, and cope with it using daydreams.   Most of my daydreams consist of characters from media rather than my own. I go on adventures and bond with these characters, all in my mind. I feel an actual emotional connection. They comfort me, have conversations, cuddle with me in bed, and (before someone else brings it up) have sexual experiences as well. What helps is that I can control their reactions, even if their personality is already established. I can play out any scenario I want to.

I don't know, I guess because I both know everything about them (from watching their character) and can "control" them, I feel safer with them than I do with real people. And this bothers me (oh look at that, I got to the point!) because I feel like I'm supposed to get this support from real people.

Just for fun, here are some characters I've daydreamed about in the past: Sonic the Hedgehog (lol middle school), Pokemon characters, Mario...pretty much any Nintendo character, the Ninja Turtles (especially 2k3), the Ghost Adventures Crew, Ratchet and Clank, Sly Cooper, Miyamoto Usagi, a lot of cartoon characters in my childhood...
The list goes on. No shame because of my throwaway account.
