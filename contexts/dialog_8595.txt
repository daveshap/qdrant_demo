MALLOY: L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
BRAZEN: Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
MALLOY: Some areas have power - they're on line to San Onofre.
PLISSKEN: I'll need to know more about this thing.
MALLOY: Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
PLISSKEN: Defense against what?
MALLOY: There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
MALLOY: Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
PLISSKEN: So what does this thing do?
MALLOY: All you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
