Are there any previous cases where a top member in one of the three branches of federal government contributed to beginning an investigation for a controversy they were involved in?
This question is in response to Senator Franken joining in the call for an [ethics investigation](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/360697-franken-releases-new-statement-calls-for-ethics-investigation-of-himself) concerning himself and sexual misconduct before joining office. I don't think I've ever heard of a member in top government doing something like that.
