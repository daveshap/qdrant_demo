MR. PINK: I told ya he'd be pissed.
MR. WHITE: What are you gonna do about him?
EDDIE: Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
MR. WHITE: You ain't dying, he is.
EDDIE: I'll call somebody.
MR. WHITE: Who?
EDDIE: A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
MR. PINK: Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
EDDIE: Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
