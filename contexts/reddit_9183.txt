Sometimes you just have to laugh
Today I got kicked off food stamps because I “make too much money”. I just had to stop and laugh because I’m so poor. I laughed because they looked at my gross income. It’s a number way higher than I ever see in my bank account. I laughed because 90% of my minimum wage income from my full time job goes to living expenses. I laughed because I’m in that beautiful gray area where I make too much for help but not enough to get by. Sometimes you just have to laugh because there’s nothing else to do.


Edit: You guys are so awesome! I’ve been getting so many kind messages offering help. While I’m not rich, I do have everything I need. I’m really blessed! It’s just nice to know I’m not alone in the struggle!

Edit 2: Holy crap I just got off work and my inbox is overflowing. I’ve read all the kinds words you all have written. It really warms my heart knowing there are so many kind and sympathetic people out there. It’s shitty to hear all these stories of you guys suffering though. I hope everyone is in a better place now or working towards it!
