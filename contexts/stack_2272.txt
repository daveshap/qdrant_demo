How can I check for lore and custom enchants on items currently being held by a player I'm making a map based on elytra PvP and I wanted unique enchants so that flying PvP would be more meaningful and exciting. I got stuck on how to do the enchants.So I know how you can put lore on items as a way of storing information and indicating enchants(CosmicPvP), but I'm not sure about how to detect them using commands. I really just need syntax I can figure the rest out when I get there. Do I have to check every lore combination?
