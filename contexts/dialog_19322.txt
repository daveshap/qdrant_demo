ROB: No, I mean, no big whoop.
JOSIE: I can't do this.
ROB: These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
JOSIE: Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
ROB: Why is that impossible?
JOSIE: Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
ROB: Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
JOSIE: Rob. Please focus.
ROB: Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
JOSIE: Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
ROB: Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
JOSIE: Is that true?
ROB: Little known fact.
ROB: Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
JOSIE: Yes, desperately.
ROB: Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
JOSIE: Better than I...
ROB: That's the spirit!
JOSIE: George! What are you doing here?
GEORGE: Just get in the van, Josie.
JOSIE: What is this?
GEORGE: Hidden camera.
JOSIE: Wings?
GEORGE: We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?""
JOSIE: I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
