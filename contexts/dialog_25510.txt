DEANNA: I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
PICARD: Is he sincere about wanting peace?
DEANNA: I don't know.
DEANNA: Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you. The same way you want to know him.
PICARD: How could I not?
DEANNA: Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
PICARD: I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
