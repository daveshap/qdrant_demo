STORM: What does that mean?
BEAST: The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind. It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
CYCLOPS: Can the Professor repair his own mind?
BEAST: I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
JEAN: He's already losing control of his vitals. Respiratory. Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
CYCLOPS: We have to find Magneto.
JEAN: Are you all right?
CYCLOPS: No. I'm... I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
