PS/2 mouse / keyboard interface info and classification My hardware interfaces teacher in the university gave a task to find info about PS/2 interface and fit it into a classification by answering a list of questions. Here's what I've found: Which type of connection it uses? point-to-point (other variants: trunk, radial)Which type of Interface it uses? ? (variants: parallel, serial, hybrid)Which type of Control is applied between devices? Centralized (other variants: decentralized, partially centralized)Which Operation mode it uses? half-duplex (other variants: simplex, duplex)Which Data exchange mode it uses? synchronous (other variants: async, isochronous)Which Wire types are used to connect devices? ? (variants: coaxial, twisted pair, optical fiber, ...)But I didn't find some answers. It seems that either the classification is incorrect and there are no answers to some questions or the questions are too simple so I should be able to answer them myself. Can you help me fill the blanks and correct errors? Are the questions asked correctly? Are there even more answer options?
