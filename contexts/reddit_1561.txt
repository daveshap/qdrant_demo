Why I’m going to State School over Harvard
I decided today that I’ll be going to my state school (bad) over Harvard (good) and here’s why:

- At state school I’ll get to feel superior over my fucking useless classmates

- I’ll get to tell everybody there that I’m in the honors college 

- The merit scholarships are great! I get to take away a scholarship away from a poor kid!

- It’s a bigger community, more people for me to tell about my Harvard interview

- I didn’t get into Harvard
