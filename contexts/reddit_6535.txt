Is this company legit?
I recently went for an interview at an investment firm but am unsure if they are legitimate or not.

My concerns:

* Website is full of jargon and doesn't mention anything about who works there
* No social media presence (or Glassdoor)
* Saw only other employee at their office building (they were in a serviced office)
* Address listed on website is different to the service office address
* Job description didn't specify hours
* The interviewer doesn't have the company on his LinkedIn profile
