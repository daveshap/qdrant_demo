Finally employed! Starting Tuesday. Any advice or tips for a first time admin assistant?
Title says it all. Been unemployed for 8 months and now finally starting my first salaried FT role as an admin assistant for a medium sized government organization on Tuesday. 

I’ve done basic office and reception work before, and a lot of customer service, but I’d obviously like to make a good impression. I have a university degree and decent computer skills.

Anything I should brush up on or any tips for hitting the ground running?

Thanks for reading :)
