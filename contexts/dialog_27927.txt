GALBRAITH: We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
JERRY: A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
GALBRAITH: Yes, but what sort of a man?
JERRY: I don't know.
GALBRAITH: You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage -â€” eh?
CHARLIE: Sure!
JERRY: No. I'm serious about this.
GALBRAITH: Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
CHARLIE: I drink.
GALBRAITH: And when you drink, you get drunk.
GALBRAITH: Then what do you do?
CHARLIE: I sleep it off.
GALBRAITH: But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
CHARLIE: I don't know.
GALBRAITH: That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
JERRY: Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
CHARLIE: Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
