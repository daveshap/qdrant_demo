JAMMER: Where are we?
BUD: Missile compartment. Those are the launch tubes.
JAMMER: Lord Almighty.
BUD: Hey, you okay?
BUD: Deep and slow, big guy. Deep and slow. Just breathe easy.
JAMMER: I... they're all dead, Bud. They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
BUD: I'm taking you back out.
JAMMER: No! I'm okay now. I just don't... I can't go any further in.
BUD: Okay, Jammer. No problem. You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights. We'll stay in voice contact. Just hold onto the rope. Five more minutes. Okay?
JAMMER: Yeah, okay. Okay.
