JOE: Now what?
AL: The beach.
JOE: The beach?
AL: How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
JOE: Eating sushi?
AL: Just get there.
JOE: Holy shit!
AL: What is it?
JOE: ...Just beautiful.
AL: Do you notice anything.
JOE: The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
AL: Swim.
JOE: Good Idea!
AL: Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
JOE: Little late for that.
JOE: Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
AL: You eat it.
JOE: You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
AL: I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
JOE: Now what?
AL: The sand.
JOE: Eat it?
AL: Eat it.
JOE: I don't want to eat it.
AL: Why not?
JOE: It's sand.
AL: For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
AL: Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
JOE: Where are you going? Wait!
