All I want is someone to watch endgame with

Right now I'm on a greyhound in between Las Vegas and Magic Mountain, not even two hours into a six hour trip. It is 5:30 and we should reach the hotel by 9 pm. If I decide to post this, it'll probably have to wait until I get to the hotel. To be honest, I've had something to say here for a very long time, but I didn't want to talk about it in case I was wrong. But I'm not wrong about what I feel.

I'm writing this in Notepad on my laptop, so apologies for random line drops.

It's a Senior end of school trip, and I know everyone's name just as well as they know my name. Yet, I am somehow just far enough not to be able to talk to my own clique -- Tom, Noah, and Anne -- and close enough to read their faces and hear their conversations. Who I would consider my three closest friends are sitting  just ahead of me in two rows of two seats. There is a fourth empty seat, but I can't sit there because the person sitting there, Noah, says he gets claustrophobic, and after knowing the kind of stuff he deals with on a daily business, i decide not  to challenge him on that.  So the people in my general vicinity are all listening to music and catching up on sleep, and I can't help but watch my closest friends on the bus ride of their life. I'm one of those kids that ends up moving schools a lot. I spent each year of  middle school somewhere else, and I'm graduating high school from the third  high school I've attended. It even cost me taking a calculus class since I kept switching curriculum's. Though I don't feel knew to the school, it's been only a year here since my birthday in march. Of Tom, Noah, and Anne, I've known each person for different amounts of times. Noah, i met first in elementary school, and met him here again after I had thought I said goodbye to him for the last time in middle school. A lot has happened to him since then and I'm still learning piece by piece. Tom, I met after shadowing him a week before I was enrolled in this newest school. We ended up having a near identical schedule except for Latin, so it was pretty easy to become friends with him. We even became Public Forum partners and took our skills to a tournament in Arizona. And then there's Anne. I knew Anne by name when i first started  going here, but it was only since the beginning of this school year that I  started talking to her more. Between us, we are the only seniors on the speech and debate team, meaning it was pretty easy for us to keep close. But then there's this curse that anyone who's always switching schools carries: the moment you truly feel close, you're on your way out the door. In this case, we left for Magic Mountain right after a college declaration assembly in which Noah said he'd go to UNLV, Anne to SUU, Tom to Washington State, and myself to UNR. These are our last moments, and I can only watch them. The worst of it is that I never even felt like a close friend to these people, rather just the  fourth guy that showed up one day. To them, I feel like only a PF partner, only a Speech and Debate teammate, and nothing more. 

All I wanted was someone to watch endgame with. It's been I think three weeks,  and not one of us four had gotten around to seeing it. Because it's about the end of the school year now, AP exams finally out of the way, I thought we could see Endgame together. I asked Tom first, but he told me he was busy. I'm always left to assume with him because he's always busy and then I ask him Monday how his weekend was and he'll tell me he didn't do anything. I was on my way to ask Noah second, but I didn't even bother with him. He got into really bad trouble  that kicked him off the Debate team and his mother doesn't let him leave the house anymore unless it's a mandatory school event. And then Anne. Now if I can take a second to be fully honest, I am in love with Anne. It's not just one of those teenage crushes you get every 7 seconds you spend with a cute girl you wish you might hang out with more often. I know, because I swore off that at the beginning  of the school year, and every second with her, the thought never crossed my mind. I only realized how I felt about her when we hung out at prom. I told her that I  wished I asked somebody, anybody, out to prom and she asked me who, and I didn't  respond because in my mind, I was about to tell her "you." Anyways, I ended up asking everyone else, kept getting the same answers, and ended up watching the damn movie by myself in the dead of night at some little theater out of a casino. I'd give it an 9 out of 10. I really liked the scene where Steve Rogers picked up mjolnir. Tom already dated another ex of mine this year. Jane. Last year, I took Jane to  Junior prom, and we lasted about about two months after that. For the longest  time, Tom and Jane were always fighting with each other, Jane being Chinese, Tom liked to show her pictures of Tienanmen Square and say "That's you, lol." I don't know why they decided to forget all that for six months to have some sort of show-up romance. I actually don't take it personally, but it really bothered me because Jane was still uncomfortable talking to me and wanting to take Tom away from me so that they'd have more time together. That's why I'm scared that the more time they end up spending together, the more likely they'll be dating when I finally say something.

That's why I've made a promise -- and I don't make promises too often -- to tell Anne before the bus ride home Friday morning. Now there's another three hours left to the hotel. I can only hope I have a chance to talk to her some more when we get there before.
