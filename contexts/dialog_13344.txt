NATHAN: Lila?
GABRIELLE: That's Lila?
LILA: Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
NATHAN: Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
LILA: Eat shit, thumbtack dick! Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
