Misunderstood how many sick days I got, learned about it 2 years in
So I had my biweekly 1-on-1 with my manager on Wednesday, the meetings are usually just us talking about how I'm doing on my project, company updates, etc. Never really had an issue in my two years. But this week he kind of awkwardly brought up that I was -73 hours on sick time. Apparently I misunderstood our sick time as 15 days/year but it's actually 10. I had been slowly going deeper negative over time, and neither my old manager nor this manager noticed until now.

He made sure to mention that he knows I'm a good performer, he recognizes it wasn't intentional, and he hasn't heard anything from HR about it. He still said he'd like to talk with the managers one and two levels above him to figure out what to do about it since he'd never dealt with this before. He came back like 30 minutes later and reiterated I'm not in trouble, but to just not mark sick on my timecard until I'm in the green and use vacation days instead if I'm sick.

I'm not upset about the outcome, he sounds understanding. But I am embarrassed and I really dislike the feeling of being in the spotlight like this in the manager chain. This, coupled with the fact that I've been using my 2018 sick days a little judiciously in the past month as I adjust to my antidepressant dosage change.

I typed this all out and I guess I don't have a question because I'm not in trouble and the solution is clear. But anyone with a similar experience would make me feel better lol, because this sucks and it took me from a 3 month streak of loving the work day to dreading it because I'm self conscious that I'm not performing well enough now. If you're a manager, what would you do in this situation and what would you like to see from the employee? I'm worried it's going to affect yearly bonus/raise offers this year or in the future.
