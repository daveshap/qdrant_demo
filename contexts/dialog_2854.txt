STYLES: You think you could explain all this to me?
HARDY: I wouldn't know where to start. I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
OSBORNE: What happens to Dunbar now?
STYLES: Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
HARDY: They're taking your command, aren't they?
STYLES: The Senator...
HARDY: I'm sorry, Bill.
STYLES: Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
HARDY: You're a good soldier, Bill.
STYLES: I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
