QUALEN: Where's the third one, Travers?
TRAVERS: There, what's that place?
GABE: Looks like the Tower. It's a bad climb.
QUALEN: A bad climb, no, just another challenge. What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
TRAVERS: Get off my back, Qualen!
QUALEN: I haven't even got on it yet. Let's go, time to fetch.
QUALEN: The faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
HAL: Right, all the bullets we can eat.
