SALLY: What, again?
BRETT: Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
SALLY: What?--
BRETT: I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
SALLY: I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
BRETT: You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
SALLY: You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
BRETT: I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
SALLY: I think we ought to walk.
