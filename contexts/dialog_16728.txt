BOBBY: Who you calling?
RICKY: Shhh... Hello, room service?
BOBBY: C'mon, man...
RICKY: Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
BOBBY: How much is it?
RICKY: How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
BOBBY: How much was it?
RICKY: Forty-six.
BOBBY: Jesus, man. Plus ten?
RICKY: Yeah, I guess.
BOBBY: Great. On my fucking room.
RICKY: Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
BOBBY: Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
RICKY: Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
BOBBY: Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
RICKY: But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
BOBBY: Oh really. Why's that?
RICKY: We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
BOBBY: Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
RICKY: Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
BOBBY: What are you doing?
RICKY: What are you doing?
BOBBY: I know you're not calling Jimmy.
RICKY: As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
BOBBY: We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
RICKY: You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
BOBBY: It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
RICKY: Well, I don't want to walk.
