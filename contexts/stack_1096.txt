Build a Hyper-V template w/ SQL Server 2016 pre-installed The problem that I've encountered is in renaming the \"template\" to the \"production\" server name. SQL Server sys.servers, server_id =0 retains \"template\not \"production\".The only way around this seems to be to re-install SQL Server -- defeating the purpose of a template.Note: sp_addserver has been discontinued; sp_addlinkedserver cannot create server_id =0 (local).
