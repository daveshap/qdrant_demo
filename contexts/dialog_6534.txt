RUBEN: Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
CONRAD: I brought a present for the lady, there. I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
RUBEN: You break into her apartment to deliver a gift? Where is it?
CONRAD: The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
RUBEN: Where is it?
CONRAD: I'm trying to tell you. It's on the lady's pillow...
CONRAD: Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it. They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow. It has all about how he tried to kill her.
RUBEN: He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad? You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
CONRAD: The door was already open...
RUBEN: We know... Send the book to evidence...
CONRAD: She's supposed to have it.
RUBEN: She don't want it.
