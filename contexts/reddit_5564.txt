High School Diploma Qualifications
Hi everyone, first time posting on this subreddit. This is probably a dumb question but doesn't hurt to ask. I currently work a retail job and I've tried to look for a better job in the past but most jobs require a bachelor's degree and up. I've been told by several people I know that I could probably get a non-retail job with just my high school/little bit of community college education. Have any of you ever landed a job where you were hired with just your diploma and moved up?
