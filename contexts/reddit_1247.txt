Does anyone else here creates arguments in mind and hypothetical scenarios which affects you emotionally?
Whenever I think of some little scenarios which really is happening then later on my mind make it worse like it creates arguments with somebody and i feel like it is real like i felt it emotionally then things got even worse when negative thoughts coming out and i feel if that would happen it would be my fault. There were also times that i even felt i was about to cry just by thinking those things. Can somebody please tell me what i am going through.
