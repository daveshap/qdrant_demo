I tried to kill myself two months ago because my parents won't stop blaming me for my sister's death
Hello, I'm Gretel, 18 year old Mexican female. I want to be brief, I tried to kill myself two months ago. My psychologist told me about this social media site so I come to share what I feel.

I jumped off my house rooftop (3 story-house) butI only broke my arm. I feel stupid because I couldn't kill myself. 

All my suicidal thoughts started when at age 5, I accidentally caused an accident which killed my sister. She was my twin, 5 as well. My parents won't stop blaming me for her death. We were playing on my house stairs and I stumbled and made a decoration statue fell on her head. I cannot forgive myself for that even if my psychologist has already told me I'm not the one to blame.

Sorry about my English, I speak Spanish as my first language.
