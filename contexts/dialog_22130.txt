JOE: Aren't you?
MR. ORANGE: I don't have the slightest fuckin' idea what you're talkin' about.
MR. WHITE: Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
JOE: Like hell I am.
MR. WHITE: Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
JOE: You don't know jack shit. I do. This rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.
MR. PINK: Mr. Blue's dead?
JOE: Dead as Dillinger.
EDDIE: The motherfucker killed Vic.
MR. WHITE: How do you know all this?
JOE: He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined for goin' forward when I wasn't a hundred percent. But he seemed like a good kid, and I was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.
MR. WHITE: That's your proof?
JOE: You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
