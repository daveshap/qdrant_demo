Life has completely destroyed me.
I am a 25 year old woman now and i am completely broken. I will end my life tonight. My mom died when i was 9 and when my dad took "care" of me i was raped for 3 whole years. Almost every single day i was abused. This left me as a severe depressed shy girl in highschool and i was bullied for being like that. I told my only best "friend" what happened to me and suddenly the whole school found out. I attacked her for it, injured her badly and ended up in a teen jail (we have that in germany, not sure if that exists elsewhere). After a few months there the guards started to sexually abuse me as well. I left my body at this point and wasn't really there anymore mentally. 

After all this, life finally looked good for me, i started a job and had my own apartment and i thought it gets better. But apparently one of my old highschool classmates then black mailed me, threatening to tell my boss about my past. I begged him not to do it, and he asked me for sex or he will leak the information. I had to oblige and took his abuse to keep my job. Police never believed me because i had no evidence. He blackmailed me in person, not digitally. I couldn't prove it. After 1 year of being his sextoy, he still leaked the info.

I got fired today and am now homeless. I am literally using my last phone battery to type this down. I have nowhere to go now. The women's help organization disapproved of me as well because i was in jail once.


I completely lost all hope there is nothing that will change my mind anymore. I reached the end and it will end now. Goodbye.




Edit: Thanks so much everyone. Sorry i can't respond to each of you. I am now being taken care of in a mental institution. All of you together did change my mind in the end...
