KIRK: Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
SAREK: Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
KIRK: Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
SAREK: Met his death"? How could you
KIRK: I -- saw no future --
SAREK: You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was in death
KIRK: Yes, I was...
SAREK: Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
KIRK: But -- why?
SAREK: Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
KIRK: Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
SAREK: He would not have spoken of it openly.
KIRK: Then, how --
SAREK: Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
KIRK: Of course...!
SAREK: ... He spoke of your friendship.
KIRK: Yes...
SAREK: He asked you not to grieve...
KIRK: ... Yes...
SAREK: ... The needs of the many outweigh...
KIRK: ... The needs of the few...
SAREK: ... Or the one.
KIRK: ... Spock...
SAREK: I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
KIRK: ... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
SAREK: Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
KIRK: But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
SAREK: I see... and I understand. Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
KIRK: Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
SAREK: Yes... But -- how...?
KIRK: Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
