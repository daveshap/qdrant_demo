FATHER: Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
ANNA: No, Dad, it isn't.
FATHER: And how long will you be away?
ANNA: Four or five days.
FATHER: Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
ANNA: Used to what?
FATHER: To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
ANNA: But how could you say such a thing?
FATHER: Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
ANNA: And have you any other truths to tell me?
FATHER: You already know what they are.
ANNA: You mean Sandro, don't you? Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
