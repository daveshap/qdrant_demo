GRADY: Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
HANK: Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
GRADY: What made you pull out that old thing?
HANK: I was thinking of you.
GRADY: And?
HANK: It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
GRADY: Maybe I should read it.
HANK: Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
GRADY: Where's Emily, Hank?
HANK: I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
GRADY: I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
HANK: Where you stand?
GRADY: I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
HANK: She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
GRADY: Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
HANK: Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
GRADY: Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
HANK: Ah, right. The book.
GRADY: Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
HANK: Why did you come here, Grady?
GRADY: I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean Goodbye.""
HANK: Give me a break, Grady.
