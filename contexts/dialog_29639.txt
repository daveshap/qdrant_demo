STIPE: I did two tours in 'Nam...
EDDIE: Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
EDDIE: Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
STIPE: They g-got the wrong g-guy.
EDDIE: When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
STIPE: I always t-tell the truth. That's why I'm here.
EDDIE: ...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer? You left your telephone number?
STIPE: Y-yes, sir.
EDDIE: Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
STIPE: No, s-sir.
EDDIE: Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
