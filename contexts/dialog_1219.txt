DAVID: There were witnesses?
DR. HIRSCH: So they said.
DAVID: How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
DR. HIRSCH: In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
DAVID: Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
MISS GALLAGHER: Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
DAVID: I was having a nightmare.
