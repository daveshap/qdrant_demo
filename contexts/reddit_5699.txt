What can I do about my current situation?
Hi, so i’m 19, turning 20 in a few months, but i’ve been having a really difficult time trying to get a job interview or even hired.(and I’m not homeless or have a threat with homelessness, so that isn’t an issue)

- I don’t have a highschool diploma (dropped out of highschool since age 17 due to health problems and difficulty attending daily) but I did do almost a year of college in hopes that maybe that would help(it didnt)
- I cant drive/never learned how, so I have issues with reliable transportation in that area or able to have the ability to snatch a job that requires driving
- I have month to over a year gaps in job consistency and even when I did have a job, I’d have to quit due to unreliable transportation/sudden city to city moving and also would get fired for lack of performance under high stress(so unstable with lasting jobs)

-Job areas ive applied for(retail, fast food, cafes, restaurants, shoe/book/clothing stores/shops, grocery stores, pharmaceutical based, hair places;think sallys, at malls, movies, post offices, etc)
- I live in a college area and not out in the city so most jobs are taken by either those in college or those who have a lot of stable job experiences 
- Ive sent out emails, called places back(to be told they aren’t hiring even when their stores have a hiring now poster up), re-applied to jobs(well over 30), applied both with and without resumes, etc and all of them keep telling me they found better matches or aren’t hiring


I really do need some sort of good advice here because I’ve been unemployed for a year and need just general help since I’m at a loss with knowing what I can do
