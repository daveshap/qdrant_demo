DMITRI: Nervous?
ANYA: Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
DMITRI: You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
VLADIMIR: May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
SOPHIE: Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
