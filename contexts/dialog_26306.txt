LINDA: I can do that.
LUCY: No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
LINDA: There isn't any.
LUCY: This is all your clothes?
LINDA: I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
LUCY: Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
LINDA: I'd rather not talk about it.
LUCY: You're not...an orphan are you?
LINDA: My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
LUCY: Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
LINDA: Thank you. You're very kind.
