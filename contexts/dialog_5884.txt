GITTES: Not exactly.
PILOT: But that's what you told your wife.
PILOT: Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
GITTES: I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
PILOT: Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
GITTES: I'm working for his daughter.
PILOT: That right?... She used to be some looker.
GITTES: She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
PILOT: She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
GITTES: You must be thinking of a different daughter.
PILOT: No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
GITTES: She ran away?
PILOT: Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
PILOT: Course, she settled down nicely.
GITTES: Well, you never know, do you?
PILOT: That's for sure.
GITTES: Why'd she run away?
PILOT: Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
GITTES: We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
PILOT: She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
GITTES: You don't say?
PILOT: Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
