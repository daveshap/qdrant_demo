Should I quit my retail job?
I'm 18, second semester college student working at a grocery store. 

I originally started working there 8 months ago to pay for school.   
It's a comfy job, union, can't be fired on the spot, and have accommodated my available hours quite well. Last semester I worked \~20 hours a week, this semester only \~10, weekends only.

Lately I have been getting more overwhelmed with assignments with no time to really just relax and dread going to work because of it. 

I will hopefully have a paid internship in the fall so I definitely will be quitting then, I also was considering quitting before my next semester as I definitely won't have time. 

I don't hate my job, or anything, I just feel as if it is causing me more stress then I can handle sometimes.

Financially I don't need it to pay for school anymore. I just don't know if it's a smart idea to quit and would like some advice if possible before making my decision.
