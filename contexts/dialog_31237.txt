WILLOW: She needs to be changed.
SORSHA: I changed her already!
WILLOW: She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby. Soon the baby stops crying. Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire. Then his eyes focus on the fire.
SORSHA: Who is that horrible friend of yours?
WILLOW: Madmartigan.
SORSHA: Who is he?
WILLOW: I don't know much about him.
