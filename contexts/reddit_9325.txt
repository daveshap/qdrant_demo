Dear media: please stop talking about the HEROES act like it is already a law. It passed the house, which was expected, but the senate won't even look at it until June. If it does pass the senate and get signed by the president, it will likely be drastically different.
Saying, "A second stimulus check and hazard pay for frontline essential workers has passed" is irresponsible. It's click-bait style news headlines.
