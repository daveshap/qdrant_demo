Please help i’m gay and desperate
Ok so basically i’m bi and nobody knows (and i want it to remain that Way rn) and i am desperate for affection, but seriously cant handle boy drama, so i’m looking for a girlfriend, but i have no idea where to look, and It’s really hard to find people (and people who like me back for that matter) without exposing yourself (i should also say that i’m 14, and have lever been in a relationship before, or even kissed anyone, because i’m scarred of attachmemt, yay) But right now i’m ready for anything, so please help me oh kind strangers. I think a big part of the problem is that bi people my age are either closeted or haven’t figured out their sexuality yet, which is what i’m trying to do, so thats a problem.

One of the things i’m considering, is changing my style, like cutting my hair really short, and wearing different clothes, to make other queer people notice my gayness. but like i don’t really know what that invovels exactly. What do lesbians wear, i forget.

I literally dont know What to do so now im seaking help from strangers on the internet
