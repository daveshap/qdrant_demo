Anxiety feels like drowning
It always sneaks up on me-anxiety and depression that is. I try not to expect it because it's like always waiting for the other shoe to drop but it often sneaks up on me when I'm not expecting it. Usually it's after I've had a really amazing time out with my friends that I feel at my most prone for attack. Anxiety and depression often tagteam me with thoughts of worthlessness, exhaustion, and paranoia. Often times the paranoia is whether or not my friends hate me, whether or not they wish I was gone, and whether or not I am worthy of any real love. This time the issue is  compounded by missing an ex who was ultimately a pretty shit boyfriend. I could feel the tendrils of anxiety and depression  sneaking up on me wrapping around my throat pulling me down. You're worthless your friends hate you they put up with you -your dads right about you. On an intellectual level I know none of that is really true but intellect doesn't really factor into depression.  I'm so tired of trying to be strong and tired of feeling weak. I feel like I'm hurtling headlong into an abyss of  a breakdown and I can't slow it down and I can't stop it. I miss being loved and feeling companionship I feel like I'm always worrying about never being loved. I just feel really alone and afraid and I don't know if this is the right place for this but I would love to feel like I'm a part of something and that someone really does care. I'm really sick of hearing that I'll find the right one and that he's out  there and I don't need a man. I just miss feeling loved.
