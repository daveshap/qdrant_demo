Will a GPA below 3.0 in undergrad bar me from all grad programs 3-4 years later?
I received a B.S. in economics but had a 2.8 gpa after nearly failing a semester (had kidney failure).  I didn't take my classes seriously at the time either.  It hasn't mattered in the job market yet but I want to get a masters degree in the next few years.  A few schools I've looked at require a minimum of a 3.0 GPA in undergrad.  It's been a few years since I graduated; will this still matter that much if I receive high scores on the GMAT/GRE? Has anyone had a similar experience and found a way to get into a graduate program?
