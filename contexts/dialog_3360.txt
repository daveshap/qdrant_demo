FRANKLIN: ... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
ALLENBY: I have no idea...
FRANKLIN: Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
ALLENBY: Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
FRANKLIN: Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
ALLENBY: I see. Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
FRANKLIN: Of course, Doctor, I understand.
ALLENBY: Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
FRANKLIN: Certainly, glad to be of help.
STIEGLER: Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
CHANCE: Hello, Ronald.
STIEGLER: Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
CHANCE: I can't write.
STIEGLER: Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
CHANCE: I can't read.
STIEGLER: Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
CHANCE: Yes. I like to watch.
STIEGLER: Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
CHANCE: What sort of bed is it?
