The hospital "forgot" $3500 in charges and just "remembered" almost an entire year after the fact. I feel sick.
Update: I called the hospital and the woman said its *totally normal* to be billed a year later and to call my insurance company. So I guess that's my next step. I'm just so tired of US healthcare right now. :/

I just got an email saying that I had a new bill on MyChart. I logged on and saw that instead of the $500 I was working on paying off, my total was now almost $4000! When I looked, I saw that my insurance company had reached out to the hospital to track down some information and suddenly the hospital "remembered" that I had $3500 charges from last September (almost a year ago!) and applied that to my previous total. This is coming after a fight which ended in my insurance company paying them $15,500 which left that $500 I was paying off. I'm pissed that if my insurance hadn't reached out to them, they probably wouldn't have noticed, and I'd have paid off my account in the next few months.

Guys, I don't know what to do. I can't afford that. I'm already paying $400 a month in medical bills alone, plus $200 in utilities and $1000 in rent. I'm pregnant as well.

The funny thing is, they addressed the new statement to my 11 month old daughter. The statement literally states that ***she*** needs to explain why her insurance isn't covering it, why she can't afford it, etc. Do I write back on her behalf and say that she's unemployed, does not have a bank account, and will not be able to pay off this debt until she's at least 16 and legally employable? I mean... How do I navigate this situation?
