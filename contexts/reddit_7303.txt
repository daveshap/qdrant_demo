Halted training advice
I work as an independent contractor editing from home. I have been with my main company for 5 years. I wanted to make more money since we are buying a house, so I applied to another company. Being an IC, I don’t have anything in my contract that says I can’t have multiple jobs. My supervisor even said she didn’t care as long as I wasn’t bad mouthing main company. I love it, so I wouldn’t. 
Another editor with my main company also applied and started at the new company. Main company then starts talks about possibly moving us to employee status. Other editor quits new job and tells them she is being made employee at main company. 

Now new company doesn’t want to continue training me because of what she said. Conflict of interest if employee at main company and IC at new company. Thing is...there is no guarantee we are being made employees at main company. If we are, it won’t be for a while. 

I’m really upset because we just bought a house, and I wanted extra money to get some things fixed. I tried to explain to new company it’s not a for sure thing (which is true...again, just ideas being tossed around) and wouldn’t happen for a long time if it did. The director had emailed me and asked if I was an employee now with main company.

Don’t know what else to do to try and save this job. Any advice?
