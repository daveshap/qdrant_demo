WALLACE: Upset! What's he upset about?
DEAKINS: Said he's not an actor.
WALLACE: He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point. He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero. That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it. Did she call him back?
DEAKINS: She's talking to him now.
WALLACE: We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
DEAKINS: How'd it go?
GALE: He'll do it. You really-should have talked to him first.
