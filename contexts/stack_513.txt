openssh-server can't connect remotely I've got a fresh install of 16.04.3 desktop with openssh installed.  I can connect to ssh on the same machine, but not across my internal network. ufw is inactive.The server host cannot be pinged by other hosts on my local network. It also cannot ping other hosts on the local network. The server host is able to be ping google.com, yahoo.com, etc.What am I missing to get ssh to work remotely?
