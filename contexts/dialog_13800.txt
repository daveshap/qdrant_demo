LOWELL: What did you get us?
WIGAND: Tempura...
WIGAND: The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
LOWELL: Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally.
WIGAND: Next to your father?
LOWELL: My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
WIGAND: Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
LOWELL: You charge by the hour?
WIGAND: My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
LOWELL: Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on 60 Minutes
WIGAND: Why?
LOWELL: They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
WIGAND: I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have. I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake... I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's. I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
LOWELL: I'm not pushing you around! I'm asking you questions.
WIGAND: I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
LOWELL: ...to a network, probably, we're all commodities. To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
