JOE: Like the guys that attacked us.
AL: What do you mean?
JOE: Black suits and helmets.
AL: That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
JOE: That's not a good idea.
AL: They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
JOE: Gone where?
AL: Don't know.
JOE: You need ID in there?
AL: You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
JOE: I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
AL: You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
