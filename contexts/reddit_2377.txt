Did Covid-19 put a halt on your job search ? Join the club.
Right before the mass hysteria happened, I had just completed a preliminary video interview for this media/entertainment company.  I was calm, cool and collected. Took my time and practiced so I was confident throughout the process. They said I would hear the results back in 1-3 weeks. However, I did not expect a global pandemic to be going on at the same time as well lol. I still feel very confident and optimistic about it. It just sucks that this pandemic happened at the WRONG time. I want to reach out to the recruiter who contacted me but I donâ€™t even know if there office is closed or not. The job is located in NYC and I feel like it could be another month before I hear back about the results. Has the Covid-19 interrupted anyone else on their job search ? We are in this together.
