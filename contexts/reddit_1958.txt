My OFFICIAL rejection letter to the colleges I will not be attending
Dear **\[COLLEGE\]**,

Thank you for your interest in me.

After careful consideration of your acceptance, I regret to inform you that I am unable to offer you enrollment for the Fall of 2019. Please understand that this decision does not at all diminish the quality and prestige of your school’s acceptance, which I am sure was offered with great thoughtfulness and care. I was humbled by the passion, dedication, and commitment to excellence of your school, students, and faculty. This year, there were a record number of qualified and prestigious acceptances which were received. If I could enroll at all of the colleges I was admitted to, I absolutely would. However this would be both incredibly expensive and unequivocally irresponsible. For that reason, I conducted a holistic review of each school and want to assure you that your school was given careful and complete consideration. Ultimately, no single attribute or achievement guarantees enrollment. I could only extend one school an offer of enrollment from this exceptionally talented pool. Unfortunately, some tough decisions had to be made, but these decisions were ultimately made with both conviction and clarity, and wait lists and appeals will not be accepted.

The great and honorable former president John F. Kennedy once said, “Then too, I would like to go to the same college as my father. To be a "Harvard man" is an enviable distinction, and one that I sincerely hope I shall attain.” While unrelated, this quote demonstrates that even applicants with poor supplemental essays can go on to become extremely talented and successful individuals, and you should in no way feel bad about your incoming freshman class. If you have not done so already I invite you to visit my Twitter feed, \[**@USERNAME**\]. What you will find here will likely make this decision seem like an ultimately more favorable outcome, and you may even be glad I will not be on your campus this fall.

I know this is not the news you hoped to receive, but consider this: in the unlikely occasion I do become rich and famous, in no way can this rejection take away from the prestige and success of your college. Past experience suggests that a specific student a college enrolls is far less important than what the college offers those students and how it helps them develop. Ultimately, I am just one face in a sea of thousands.

I want to thank you for the interest you displayed in me and wish you the absolute best of luck as you continue in the admissions process and in your future endeavors. 

Sincerely,

**\[NAME\]**
