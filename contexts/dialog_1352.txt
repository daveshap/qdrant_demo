SAMPSON: Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
DICKSON: Did you get the case for the securities?
SAMPSON: Yes, sir.
DICKSON: Mine too?
SAMPSON: Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
DICKSON: The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
SAMPSON: What'll we do?
DICKSON: I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
