MARTHA: Hello, Mama ... brought you something.
MAMA: Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
MARTHA: It's your favourite...
MAMA: Who are you?
MARTHA: It's Martha, Mama. There you go.
MAMA: Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
MARTHA: I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
MAMA: Not any more... now I like chocolate.
MARTHA: Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
MAMA: You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
MARTHA: Marie's dead Mama.
MAMA: I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood. And you believed me.
MARTHA: Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
MAMA: Who are you?
MARTHA: I... I'm Martha, Mama.
SISTER ANNE: The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
MARTHA: How do you survive?
SISTER ANNE: Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves, some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
MARTHA: Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
SISTER ANNE: No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
MARTHA: Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
SISTER ANNE: Oh that one there, in the corner.
MARTHA: The one up on the third floor?
SISTER ANNE: Yes.
MARTHA: Uh huh.
MOTHER MIRIAM: This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
MARTHA: Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
MARTHA: When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Shortly after she came to us.
MARTHA: And you weren't shocked?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I was appalled, just as you are now.
MARTHA: And what happened?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She stopped eating completely...
MARTHA: This was before her pregnancy?
MOTHER MIRIAM: About two years before.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES I've been commanded by God.
MOTHER MIRIAM: He talked to you Himself?
AGNES: No.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Through someone else?
AGNES: Yes.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who?
AGNES: I can't say.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why?
AGNES: She'd punish me.
MOTHER MIRIAM: One of the other Sisters?
AGNES: No.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who?
AGNES: Because I'm getting fat.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh, for Heaven's sake.
AGNES: I am, there's too much flesh on me.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Agnes...
AGNES: I'm a blimp.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
AGNES: Because...
MOTHER MIRIAM: ... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
AGNES: I do, I have to be attractive to God.
MOTHER MIRIAM: He loves you the way you are.
AGNES: No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who told you this?
AGNES: It's a sin to be fat.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why?
AGNES: Look at the statues, they're thin.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Agnes...
AGNES: That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who tells you these things?
AGNES: Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
MOTHER MIRIAM: That's not what he meant.
AGNES: I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
AGNES: No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh my dear child.
AGNES: God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who?
AGNES: Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
AGNES: But she watches... she listens.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
AGNES: I'm not hungry.
MOTHER MIRIAM: You've got to eat something Agnes.
AGNES: No I don't... the host is enough.
MOTHER MIRIAM: My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
AGNES: Of God.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes, of God.
AGNES: I'm being punished.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Why?
AGNES: I don't know.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Dear Jesus...
