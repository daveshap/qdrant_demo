Growing up with a mentally abusive step father
It honestly sucks ass. I have been with mine for 13 years and you wish you could leave but you are a minor. I believe that I have lower self confidence than I could’ve had growing up without a father. At the age of 6 my mom and dad had split up and I’m not really sure why till this day. I’m 17.
