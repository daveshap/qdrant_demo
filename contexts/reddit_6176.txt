I just started as a Social Media Manager at the HQ of a Fortune 500 after being depressed at home for a year. I'm in my late twenties. What advice could you give me to succeed?
For the first time I'm in a management position of a famous well-known company. What are some tips and tricks you could give me? I was in a major depression over the past year and this is my first job ever since. And this is a pretty serious job at a great firm.
