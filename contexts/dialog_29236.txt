HARRY: Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
SUZIE: You should go back and rest.
HARRY: No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
GIDEON: Man, act like this is your home.
HARRY: That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
SUZIE: One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
HARRY: Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
