MR. JOHNNY: Who was that?
ROSE: That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
MR. JOHNNY: Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
ROSE: But why would a man need more than one woman?
MR. JOHNNY: I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
ROSE: That's it! That's the reason!
MR. JOHNNY: I don't know.
ROSE: No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
COSMO: Hi. Hi.
MR. JOHNNY: Hello, Mr. Castorini.
ROSE: Where you been?
COSMO: I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going. You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
MR. JOHNNY: I have my eyes open.
COSMO: You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
MR. JOHNNY: I don't know what you mean.
COSMO: I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
MR. JOHNNY: You haven't said anything.
COSMO: And that's how much I'm saying.
ROSE: Cosmo?
COSMO: What?
ROSE: I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
COSMO: Thank you, Rose.
ROSE: You're welcome.
COSMO: I'm going to bed now.
