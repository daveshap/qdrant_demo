Should I stick with the Student Health Insurance or sign up for an individual health insurance plan?
Currently, I'm enrolled full-time in a 2-year MA program for Clinical Mental Health Counseling. I'm in my first semester and sort of passively enrolled in the student health insurance plan. I didn't fill out the Waiver form. I did this because I no longer had medical insurance (UnitedHealthcare) after leaving my previous full-time job to move to the area for school (nothern Virginia). The insurance cost for the 2018-2019 academic year is $1,970. I've taken out graduate loans and some of the loans are going toward covering that cost.

I got to thinking, though. Would it be more financially feasible for me to sign up for an individual plan? Would it be less expensive? I briefly checked quotes for UHC based on my personal information, and it shows a monthly premium of about $55. That seems it would be less costly and would allow me to allocate the loan money toward something more important. Furthermore, the deadline for waiving the student health insurance isn't until early October.

I know there's a lot of factors to consider here, like what benefits I have with the student health insurance and what the actual monthly cost would be for, say, an individual UHC plan. I intend to contact the insurance provider to get more info, and speak with someone from the Health Center to learn more about my benefits. I doubt my Financial Aid office would be sympathetic to my query since they (understandably) want me to carry the university health insurance. But I was wondering if, in a general sense, it would seem reasonable to ditch the student insurance and get my own.
