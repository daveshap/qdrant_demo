LUCY: Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
PATRICK: If we beat them, they can both go home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
LUCY: What about me?
PATRICK: Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
LUCY: Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
