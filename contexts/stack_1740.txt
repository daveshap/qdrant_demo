What are the 15 wires on my 700W BLDC servo motor for? So I have this 48V 700W DC servo motor and I cannot find the datasheet from the supplier. Unlike most stepper and servo motors, this one has 15 wires coming out of it. It says that it has an encoder built-in, so I suppose that is partly why it has so many wires.At least it has a sticker on it that gives some labels. Here is what the label says:Red: +5VBlue: AGreen: BYellow: ZBrown: UGray: VWhite: WBlack: 0VBlue/Black: A-Green/Black: B-Yellow/Black: Z-Brown/Black: U-Gray/Black: V-White/Black: W-Shell: ShieldIf you have any idea what this means or know where I can find out, I would really appreciate it.
