Would you take a fully funded MA at the well known Buddhist studies field at FSU or unfunded at Yale and Oxford?
As I tried to make clear in the title, FSU was recommended by my Yale and Duke contacts. The plan is to get an MA and then move on to a PhD.

Are Yale and Oxford worth spending all that for just an MA if FSUâ€™s program is well know within Buddhist studies?
