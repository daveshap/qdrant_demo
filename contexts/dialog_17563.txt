LEONARD: What's wrong?
NATALIE: Somebody's come. Already.
LEONARD: Who?
NATALIE: Calls himself Dodd.
LEONARD: What does he want?
NATALIE: Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
LEONARD: Did you?
NATALIE: No!
LEONARD: What's this all about?
NATALIE: You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
LEONARD: I have this condition -
: 78.
NATALIE: I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
LEONARD: What happened?
NATALIE: What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
LEONARD: Neither do I.
NATALIE: Don't protect him.
LEONARD: I'm not.
NATALIE: Help me.
LEONARD: How?
NATALIE: Get rid of Dodd for me.
LEONARD: What?
NATALIE: Kill him. I'll pay you.
LEONARD: What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
NATALIE: What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
LEONARD: That's different.
: 79.
NATALIE: Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
LEONARD: Don't talk about my wife.
NATALIE: I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
LEONARD: Calm down.
NATALIE: That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
LEONARD: Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
NATALIE: Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
LEONARD: Yes.
NATALIE: You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
LEONARD: Shut the fuck up!
