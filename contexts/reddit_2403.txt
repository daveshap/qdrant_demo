Employer is paying new hires more than me with 8 years of experience and around 5 promotions above that original position, how do I handle it?
Hello, first let me start with the fact that I currently love my job. 

I started out as a seasonal technician in 2012 at $10 an hour. I now work at $18 an hour doing full time sales / website development/ Graphic design/ and general IT. This is a huge step up over where I started and is equivalent of 4-5 promotions over the years. 

But my issue is a new hire was going on and on about how great his pay was and telling other employees. The new hire is getting payed $18.50 and hour to be a seasonal technician, which is the same position I started at. As far as I can tell he has no experience in the field and used to work in accounting. 

My question is, is this fair? I know with pay compression, new employees start to make more and more money each year. But should it outpace someone who has been at the  company for as long as I have. And to top it all off, Our company announced that because of COIVD they are not doing and raises this year.
