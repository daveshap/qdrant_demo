Have my first serious girlfriend, but I hate my appearance
A little background - I'm in Grade 11 of High School, and I'm a guy. So, I've been dating a girl for about three weeks now. That's longer than any relationship I've ever had. The only other two have ended really quickly. I'm also going farther with this girl. So far we've only made out, but that's even more than I've done before. The thing is - I am kinda fat. The problem is that you can't tell unless I'm naked. With a shirt and jeans on, I look fairly skinny. The second those come off, my stomach hangs out and my thighs squeeze up against each other. So I'm worried that if I do go all the way with this girl, she'll be grossed out by the fact that I'm actually fat. Any advice would be much appreciated, it's the only thing I can think about when I'm with her right now.
