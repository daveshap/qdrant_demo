How do aliens get stronger? Over the course of a playthrough, what determines the strength and quantity of the alien units you fase on missions? For example, do the aliens grow stronger:continuously over time?at specific points in time (e.g. end of each month)?after each mission?as XCOM's squad ranks up?as XCOM's tech advances?as more regions are contacted?A few implications of this are:If I skip a mission, am I letting the aliens grow stronger while I miss out on resources, or do both sides stagnate?Will pushing XCOM's tech forward only cause the aliens to advance as well?If wait to start a mission (e.g. a facility assault), do I risk it getting suddenly harder after a certain event (e.g. the end-of-month status report)?
