Is it worth paying for a "professional" resume writer and LinkedIn profile "designer?"
I've been hearing from multiple people that it may be worth paying someone to edit or write my resume and LinkedIn profile. It seems odd, but a small price to pay for potentially landing a solid job.

Thoughts and opinions?
