My mum has fattened me up till i was overweight
Iam african American who 16 and female

I had healthy bmi of 22 but about 2 months after my 16th my slightly obese mum said i should gain some weight as iam underweight and i told her iam healthy weight and proved it with bmi but she said i would look more attractive and i didnt want to argue so i said i would so because of my bad school grades she let me quit school and all we ate was MacDonalds or pizza and i like never left the bed and one day my mum measured my body and i had bmi 25.7 makng me 0.7 overweight so iam slightly overweight and i have now got 34 inch wast but it was covered up by my big boobs (they now go 5 inches from my waist) and my ass is massive but now iam really unfit
And get out of breath going to kitchen but my mum is now really happy for me and i really dont want to argue with her and she tells me not to do exercise saying its bad and said if she catches me doing exercise iam in big trouble and shes constantly watching me what should i do

If someone else has experienced something similar pls give me help
