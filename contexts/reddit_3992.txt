I'm trying to keep my dating standards low but it's hard and I'm getting frustrated.
In short, I believe that a man shouldn't be valued based on how much money he brings to the table but what is in his heart. I have tried to get involved with a high school dropout who was disrespectful to me after I tried to force myself to believe that I'm doing a good thing by trying to be friends with someone who regularly puts me down and disrespects me. Everytime I try to date or become close with guys who are poor, broke and didn't graduate high school it never works out and they offer me little to nothing. People generally say don't be shallow and give a man a chance if you really love him but in my experiences it never worked out. I'm honestly just thinking screw this I'm done I'll just find a freaking rich man
