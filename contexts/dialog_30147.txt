KUJAN: What do you mean I can't see him?
RAB IN: The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
KUJAN: Did they charge him with anything?
RAB IN: Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
KUJAN: What'the fuck is that?
