HALLIE: Who is that guy?
SIDNEY: It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
HALLIE: No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
SIDNEY: I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
SIDNEY: What do you want?
RANDY: I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
SIDNEY: Do you work for her now?
RANDY: Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
SIDNEY: Me, too. Randy. Me too.
