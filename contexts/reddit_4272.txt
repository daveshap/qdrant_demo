I was already #done with dating and today I was pushed over the edge
I was chatting with some guy on Bumble, he asked me to meet up with him and when I was hesitant (and mentioned it was because he had no clear photos of his face) he just said: 

“I’m way too good looking for you”


And for some reason it like really negatively affected me. Also does it not take two minutes to take a decent selfie? I’ve been on dates with people with unclear photos and been disappointed in the past. 

I also can feel a bit insecure about my looks... I’m 30 now and I know I don’t look like a 20 year old anymore. I don’t put a ton of makeup on and so my photos are more natural looking. I don’t think I’m ugly but sometimes I feel like my face isn’t feminine enough or something. I also recently dated someone who would put me down and comment on how attractive other women were and I’m still recovering from that. This comment just brought all of that back and I hate that it did but I’m deleting this and all dating apps. I can be a sensitive person (it’s just who I am, it has its pros and its cons) and I feel I can’t put myself out there right now if I can’t deal with the potential for random acts of cruelty.

Anyway just wanted to vent. It was disappointing and hurtful and I don’t understand why people are this way.

Edit: thank you for the support/kind words!
