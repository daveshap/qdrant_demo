I didn't fucking ask to be here.
This is what infuriates me. "You can't kill yourself, think of how it will hurt your family." I didn't fucking ask to be in this situation. If you had given me a choice, I would have said no thanks. Now because I had the misfortune of existing, I have to suffer through the rest of my life for other people? Fuck that. I love my family, in fact that's precisely why I hate life. Knowing my mom is going to die and everyone else I love is going to die. Life fucking blows. I would do anything to just cease existing.
