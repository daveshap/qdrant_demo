Are you seriously trying to quit your job during a global pandemic and impending recession? o_O
This will probably be downvoted to hell. That’s okay. 

But really, there has been an uptick in people posting about quitting their jobs. This isn’t to berate you. If you aren’t happy, you really should find a way to leave. Your mental health and professional fulfilment is much MUCH more important in the long run. 

HOWEVER, if you know that you don’t have a fat kitty saved up or a wealthy family to fall back on- please don’t make the jump just yet! The same goes for those in jobs with an easier ‘replacement index’ or ‘entry bar’ (cringe). Don’t do it!

Think long and hard. Where I am, the depression from the lockdown retrenchments alone has led to a rise in suicides. Quitting your job and then finding yourself in the cold may put you in a worse off position.

This is sounding harsh but it is coming from a good place. Things are going to work out. We just don’t know when. In the meantime, hang in there. Take this global lockdown time to plan your exit meticulously, save up and start skilling up for the jump. 

Good luck!
