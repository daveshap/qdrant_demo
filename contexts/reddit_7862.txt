Successful MS Thesis Defense!
Despite all the commotion surrounding covid-19, and a postponing of my original defense date, I have just officially defended my masters thesis presentation. I couldn't be happier!! All digital is definitely tricky, but it worked out.

Good luck to everyone who still has to defend in this time of pandemic! If I can do it, you can do it :)
