What is the VP in a subject-dependent inversion? A canonical declarative clause consists of a subject and a predicate, the former normally being a noun phrase (NP) and the latter mostly a verb phrase (VP). Therefore, a canonical declarative clause is divided into two large chunks: NP + VP.In a subject-dependent inversion, on the other hand, the clause has the construction of 'dependent + verb + subject' as in:<blockquote>  Under the table lies a dog.</blockquote>Where 'under the table' is the dependent, 'lies' is the verb, and 'a dog' is the subject.Now, is this inverted sentence also divided into two large chunks? If so, what is the VP in this case? Is it 'Under the table lies' as follows?<blockquote>  Under the table lies (VP) + a dog (NP)</blockquote>Or should this sentence be divided differently with a different VP?
