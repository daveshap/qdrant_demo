BABE BROTHER: Why don't you come in for a while?
LINDA: I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
SUZIE: You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
GIDEON: Babe Brother is a poor boy.
