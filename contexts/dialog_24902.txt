JUNIOR: You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
THEO: It depends.
JUNIOR: It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
SHEILA: You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
KASTLE: Look who's talking!
SHEILA: Leave him alone!
KASTLE: Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that. Sheila and Kastle sit up.
