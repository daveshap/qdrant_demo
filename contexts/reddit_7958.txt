How common is it to not have health insurance provided?
I will be starting at an R1 (albeit barely) graduate STEM program this fall (in the US). I also got a GRFP, but they are making me reserve it for the first year because teaching is required. They are paying me roughly $1900/month for the very specific 19 hours of work a week. This does not cover any health insurance or school fees outside of tuition. There is a $160/month extra thanks to the grad student union on campus, but that's not much.

I probably could've gone to a better program, but this is my dream research working with a PI who has close ties to my current boss/work and so I am really looking forward to it. I also was unable to choose the classes I will be taking. Overall I'm pretty annoyed with how poor the financial situation is, but from my postdoc friends this is pretty normal. I'm lucky to have parents who can support me this first year and help supplement my income, but it infuriates me that so many students who aren't as lucky, and even work their asses off to get their own funding still have to deal with this. 

What's the situation at your university? I'm considering joining the student union ASAP and helping fight for insurance. Is it common for it to be paid for?
