Why exactly are new hires made to learn so fast for?
As far as I know or the norm of it there is this thing known as probation and it usually last for 3 months. During this time the new hires are supposed to take the chance to learn mostly of what is to be learnt and are not supposed to be someone good, and especially for those entry level hires 3 months is not even sufficient due to lack of experience. So when people are expected to get moving on their own after like less than 3 months I am not sure why exactly.
