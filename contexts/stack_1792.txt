Low idle power consumption for USB PSU I'm trying to find out how \"good\" 5V power adapters can be with respect to power consumption if:there's no attached power consumer, and/orthe consumer takes very little power, such as an ESP32 in one of its low-power sleep modesAre there particular circuits that are known to be particularly good? And how would I hunt for products that implement those?Clarification: I'm not meaning to ask about the state of the art in what's sold in the mass market market. Instead, I'm asking \"what are the best circuits known\even if they are for very specialized niche markets, or aren't available in commercial products at all. E.g. -- just a wild guess -- could it be possible to build something that has essentially two separate circuits for different load situations and dynamically switches between them? Where the low-power one is made to produce, say, 10 micro-amps at 20% efficiency for the sleep states of the processor, and the high-power one is a \"normal\" one that is kept disconnected during the sleep state?
