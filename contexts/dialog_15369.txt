FRANK: Well?
KATHY: Well what? I told you this was a stupid idea. You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
FRANK: You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
KATHY: I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic. What's this all about anyway?
FRANK: What did Dr. Fulton tell you?
KATHY: Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on. What'd he do?
FRANK: We're not sure.
KATHY: What do you think he did?
FRANK: We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
