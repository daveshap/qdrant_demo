Just A Word to the Wise (And the Fools too)
I see a lot of posts regarding whether or not someone is showing real interest in the poster. 

It's pretty simple: there's no such thing as someone being "too busy" for something that they genuinely want. People will make time in their schedule for you if they're really interested in meeting you and getting to know you. If all you get is excuses when it comes time to meet up, then newsflash: they're not that interested in you. For the sake of hope and not giving up we give benefits of doubt and make the excuses valid so as not to feel hurt or bad about that fact that the person we're interested in isn't interested in the same way, but that's what it is.

If they're really that busy at a specific point in time where you don't get to meet up, then they'll offer a rescheduled date when they know they'll be free because again, people will pursue the things they really want, so if someone really wants you, they'll find a way to make it happen.
