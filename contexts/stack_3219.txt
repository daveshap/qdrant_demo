Comic character from the 90s who resembled Spawn This one has been annoying me for a while now, I just cannot recall what the name of this guy/comic was.Was an origin story about a guy who finds a costume that looks a bit like Spawn and gives him the standard super strength/flying powers, etc, I vaguely remember it being in the back of another more established comic, can't remember which one, we're talking early to mid 1990s here. He was more of an anti-hero than hero, I remember he used to throw these bombs that looked like pills as well. No idea if it was Marvel/DC or whatever.His main enemy in the story was this guy who looked a bit like Duke Nuke'em. Spiked blonde hair, dressed in black, was a commando/army type guy. His catchphrase was something like 'If I see it coming, it can't hurt me'. Two scenes I specifically remember in the comic are when bad guy is beating the crap out of good guy in a club. Good guy doesn't have his costume on so no super powers, a couple of bouncers get involved and bad guy turns around in a rage tearing half his suit off, which allows good guy to escape.Later on good guy revisits bad guy, this time wearing the suit. He flies up to like the 80th floor of a building and starts kicking the bad guys ass. He throws him out of a window and the bad guy falls to his death...except he isn't dead yet, badly hurt, but not dead. He's crawling out of a hole, smashed to bits, repeating his catchphrase - 'if I see it coming, it can't hurt me'. Last panel is the good guy hitting him from behind with a truck, which he doesn't see coming, which presumably does kills him.Anyone remember the name of this character? Comic?
