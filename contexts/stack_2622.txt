Android App to help digitizing point layers on a Tablet In QGIS, using a pen on my touchscreen PC I can I can digitize a lot of points (e.g. 14000 pts in 2 hours) faster than with a mouse: without having the attribute form to show up I simply need to touch the screen where the point should be rather than moving the pointer with the mouse and clicking. Unfortunately, I have a collaborator that does not have a touchscreen PC. Does anybody knows if:Is there any app for android tablets that can be used to achievethe same goal?It is possible in some way to take advantage of the touch screenof an Adroid tablet to help digitizing?
