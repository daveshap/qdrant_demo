GIANCARLO: You're awake. Can you hear me? You've been shot. I'm trying to help you. You were in the water. You've been shot. It's okay now.
THE MAN: Where am I?
GIANCARLO: You're American. I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
THE MAN: <u>Where am I</u>?
GIANCARLO: You're on a boat. A fishing boat. Italian flag. We're out of Vietri. It's the cold that saved you. The water. The wounds are clean. I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay. It's clean.
THE MAN: How did I get here?
GIANCARLO: You we're lost at sea. They pulled you out. Who are you? You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back. You understand me? Who are you?
