How do I install a USB Wifi driver on Ubuntu 16.04? I have installed Ubuntu 16.04 as a dual boot with Windows 10.  I have a TP-Link wireless adapter, model number \"Archer T2U\".  It works fine under Windows 10, but Ubuntu doesn't see it.  I have no idea how to install a driver for this.  I found a help message somewhere that said to go to \"System> Administration> Hardware Drivers\but as far as I can tell, I have no such folders or directories on my system.  Keep in mind that I have only a couple of days experience with Ubuntu, and none with any other form of Linux. Also I have no internet connectivity on the target machine, so any files will have to be downloaded from a different computer and manually transferred to this machine.
