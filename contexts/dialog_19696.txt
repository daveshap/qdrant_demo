LEON: Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
OFFICIAL: Not always... look at me... I've been back twice.
LEON: Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
OFFICIAL: Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
LEON: Don't hold that against me... please!
OFFICIAL: Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
LEON: Business.
OFFICIAL: What business?
LEON: Private.
OFFICIAL: There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
LEON: Confess what?
OFFICIAL: Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
LEON: On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
OFFICIAL: You believe in our cause?
