LLOYD: - well? What happened?
KAREN: Nothing much. She apologized.
MARGO: With tears?
KAREN: With tears.
MARGO: But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
KAREN: Check.
MARGO: Very classy stuff, lots of technique-
LLOYD: You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
KAREN: Not much.
MARGO: Groom- - may I have a wedding present?
BILL: What would you like? Texas?
MARGO: I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine... ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
MARGO: There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
BILL: You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
MARGO: You know why I forgive Eve? Because she's left good behind - the four of us, together like this, it's Eve's fault - I forgive her...
MARGO: ... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
LLOYD: You know, she probably means well, after all...
MARGO: She is a louse.
BILL: Never try to outguess Margo.
MARGO: Groom.
BILL: Yes, dear.
MARGO: You know what I'm going to be?
BILL: A cowboy.
MARGO: A married lady.
BILL: With the paper to prove it.
MARGO: I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
KAREN: I remember.
MARGO: You'll be there, won't you.
BILL: Often enough to keep the franchise.
MARGO: A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd. I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight... Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
LLOYD: That depends.
MARGO: I mean really, deeply angry...
LLOYD: I don't think I could be.
MARGO: Well. I don't want to play Cora.""
