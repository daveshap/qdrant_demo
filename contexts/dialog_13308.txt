FEMALE ROOMMATE: I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
LILA: It's embarrassing, okay?
FEMALE ROOMMATE: It's not so bad. So, it just keeps growing?
LILA: Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
FEMALE ROOMMATE: Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
LILA: How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
FEMALE ROOMMATE: Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
LILA: Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
FEMALE ROOMMATE: You're fucked up, Lila. Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
