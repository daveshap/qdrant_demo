MAX: You never answered my question. You like what you do?
ANNIE: Most of the time.
MAX: But not now?
ANNIE: Like you, I'm good at it. But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
MAX: You need a vacation.
ANNIE: Just had one.
MAX: Not in a cab... I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
ANNIE: When was the last time you took one?
MAX: Soon. But I take little ones all the time. Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
ANNIE: How often you go?
MAX: Dozen times a day.
