For a molecule, does the term 'thermal vibration' mean the same thing as 'molecular vibration'? When speaking of a molecule, do both terms ('thermal vibration' and 'molecular vibration') describe the same thing, being the one and only periodic motion of the atoms within the molecule? Or, are thermal vibrations technically something different than molecular vibrations? I've read about random motions of the atoms in molecules being the thermal vibrations. Random doesn't sound like the periodic motions though (the molecular vibrations).Any clarification would help. Thanks so much.
