My boyfriend broke up with me, I got a 72 on an exam, and my dad had a heart attack. Happy Valentine’s Day!
Edit:

Holy shit this blew up. 

Let me clear up a few things. If you think it’s a lie, then I’m sorry you don’t believe me. 

1) My dad is stable right now. He isn’t going to die, but dang. It was really scary. 

2) I take Algebra 1. I took my exam late. And 72/100 is a C-, which is not good for an Asian kid 

3) as for the post. Things weren’t going well between me and him for the past couple days. I felt like I didn’t have anyone. I was always so close... and I thought I could fix it. But he said it to my face at least. I deleted the post so I can stop getting comments about it. 

4) I posted this twice because the first time I forgot to add a flair. 

Right now I’m just trying to calm down. Thank you, Reddit.
