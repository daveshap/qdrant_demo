How do you cope with being the only female or one of the few in the office?
I work in engineering field which I knew was very male dominated when I got into it. Recently the male dominated and boys club aspects of the job are starting to get to me. I try my best not to think that I'm being passed up on work or being treated different because of my gender but it's hard. How do you cope with this without making a big deal about it?
