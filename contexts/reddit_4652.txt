I feel so helpless and I want to be unconscious so bad
Something happened and I’ve never felt this low in my life I feel like everyone expects so much of me and I feel like I will never be good enough to make them happy and to meet their expectations of me .  Feel like I can’t live this life . I don’t know what to do. I just don’t want to be alive right now. I can’t avoid these things that’s happening in my life I can’t ignore it but I can’t keep living through them. I am shaking right now I don’t know waht to do anymore. I feel so lost. I jsut want to feel peace and not worry so much for once but I can’t do that. Thank for letting me vent. It feels good to vent.
