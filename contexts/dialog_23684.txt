HALLORAN: No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't. I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
DANNY: Is there something bad here?
HALLORAN: Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
HALLORAN: Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
HALLORAN: Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see. Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
DANNY: What about Room 237?
HALLORAN: Room 237?
DANNY: You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
HALLORAN: No I ain't.
DANNY: Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
HALLORAN: Nothing. There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out! You understand, stay out!
WENDY: Good Morning, hon. Your breakfast is ready.
JACK: What time is it?
WENDY: It's about eleven thirty.
JACK: Eleven thirty - Jesus!
WENDY: I guess we've been staying up too late.
JACK: I know it.
WENDY: I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
JACK: Hmm, nice.
WENDY: It's really pretty outside. How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
JACK: Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
WENDY: Any ideas yet?
JACK: Lots of ideas. No good ones.
WENDY: Well, something'll come. It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
JACK: Yeah... that's all it is.
WENDY: It's really nice up here, isn't it?
JACK: I love it. I really do. I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
WENDY: Yeah. It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place. I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
