Early Career: The Safe Road or the Hard Road?
I'm turning 26 and currently work for City/Municipality as a Civil Engineer, I work 35 hours a week and make a good chunk more than my friends who graduated with the same degree.

I'm bored, do not feel challenged, and the work really does not resonate with me.  I'm so grateful to have this job.  But a part of me would rather take a substantial paycut and develop skills where I do something new and that I love everyday.

Just as an example, I got offered a Tech consulting gig as an ERP consultant working crazy hours and who knows if it's even rewarding.

My heart tells me everyday to quit and try something new.  Problem is, my position was really competitive (600 applicants for 3 positions).  There's no way I can ever come back after leaving, and I know I'll be grateful to have this job during a recession or when I have a family 5-10 years from now. 

Anyone been in the same circumstance?
