FRIDA: I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
MR. GRANT: Yes, that's what we're looking for.
FRIDA: I think we should do something with strong female characters...
MR. GRANT: I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
DOCTOR: That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
FRIDA: Nearly four.
DOCTOR: How have you been feeling?
FRIDA: Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
DOCTOR: Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
FRIDA: I get crazy dreams and I black out.
DOCTOR: Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called The PMS Diet
FRIDA: Does she have PMS?
DOCTOR: Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
PETER: You busted me.
FRIDA: Are you following me?
PETER: No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
FRIDA: Intriguing?
FRIDA: I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
PETER: At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
