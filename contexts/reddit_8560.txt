What are the consequences of Title X funding being taken away from Planned Parenthood?
Based on the [Recent Vote](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/pence-congress-planned-parenthood/521349/?utm_source=feed) it sounds as if Title X funding can soon be taken from planned parenthood but what does this mean for the whole organization itself? according to the [bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/43) it is simply repealing a regulation imposed by obama but is this simply a start and are other proposals being put into place to fully defund all aspects of planned parenthood?
