Xcode stopped detecting SVN repository changes after installing other version controlling apps Last week I installed Source Tree and Github for Dekstop version controlling apps on my Mac, prior to that I am also accessing our companies SVN repository server to contribute on our projects. While I have not installed other apps my SVN repo changes was detectable by Xcode meaning I can push/pull and commit directly from the Xcode.But after installing those apps Xcode stopped detecting the changes and I feel lost with this. System Configurations: macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 (17G65)Xcode Version: 10.0Any Apple Xcode's expert can help me with this?
