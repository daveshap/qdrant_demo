JOHN: Yeah, well, me too.
JAKE: Trouble with the car again?
JOHN: You could say. I don't even have it yet.
JAKE: Darrell giving you problems?
JOHN: He did more work on the car. He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
JAKE: Fifty dollars more. That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from? Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
JOHN: It's not like that.
JAKE: Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
JOHN: Wait a minute. Just listen to me--
JAKE: You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
JOHN: Jake--
JAKE: And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars. Or maybe two-thousand. Or twenty-thousand. Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
JOHN: That's not the reason I'm here. I swear it.
JAKE: There's another reason? It better be good.
JOHN: I came for Grace.
JAKE: You came to take my wife from me?
JOHN: I came to kill her.
JAKE: Liar.
JOHN: It's the truth, Jake.
JAKE: That's a thick change of heart.
JOHN: Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl. Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me. Same way Grace played us this morning. I don't like that, Jake. Not twice in one day. And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
JAKE: That's a lot of talk. A whole lot of talk.
JOHN: Damn it, Jake. If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me. And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace. You were going to give me thirteen-thousand. Give me two- hundred. I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money. I've got to have the money.
