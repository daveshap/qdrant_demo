NATALIE: Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
LEONARD: That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
NATALIE: Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
LEONARD: How do I know he did that to you?
NATALIE: I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
LEONARD: So I just take your word?
NATALIE: Yes.
LEONARD: Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
NATALIE: Did you?
LEONARD: What?
NATALIE: Kill him.
LEONARD: Course not.
: 38.
NATALIE: This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
