Are internships my only option to get an entry level job?
So a little backstory I'm a recent graduate out of a Cal State university. Ever since I was a kid I was diagnosed with an advance stage heart failure, but I didn't want to let that stop me from living my life. After five years of hardwork I can successfully say I got a degree in finance with a focus in insurance principles.

During my college stint I couldn't really hold a job, because of the fatigue I've gotten with my disability.

It's been increasingly difficult to explain my lack of work experience in phone screenings, since I'd rather not disclose my disability currently due to discriminatory reasons. 

Would finding an internship be the right path to start off my career? Or should I keep on applying for entry level jobs.

 I would love to get a job at a university as a coordinator, and work my way towards a master's degree or even as a director, but it's a huge hurdle getting my foot in the door. Any recommendations would be helpful. 

Currently since most job postings have been postponed/canceled, and I'm immune compromised I'm taking some LinkedIn courses to enhance my excel skills, and to learn some SQL in the meantime.
