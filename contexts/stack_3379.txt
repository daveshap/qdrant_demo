Darth Maul Timeline Inconsistencies So the original Star Wars movies had Darth Maul killed in the fight with the Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. We later find out that he survived, which was depicted in Star Wars The Clone Wars animated series, and then he makes an appearance as the leader of the Crimson Dawn criminal syndicate in the Han Solo movie.The inconsistency is that Star Wars Rebels had Darth Maul killed for good in a duel with an aged Obi-Wan, which means this happened sometime before Obi-Wan trained Luke, and surely after Han Solo movie. Is this right? Some timelines don't fit if this is the right chronological order.
