Dont be me. A message to young people with anxiety.
Im a late 40s guy who has lived with various forms of anxiety for a long time. 

I thought I could build a 'safe' life by avoiding. Constructing walls to keep the feelings of fear at bay. Keeping friends at a 'safe' distance. Staying up late at night so as to avoid daytime problems of the world. Work falling away. If I could just keep the fear and discomfort away 'today' I will let tommorow feel far away.

Except my tommorow has come. Living in a cold basement sleeping on bags of clothes. Only my phone and a cat by my side. I let anxiety master me, it tricked me into short term thinking and now my life is dark.

Dont be me. Deal with your issues. Dont avoid, the short term relief it brings is an illusion. Dont be me.

Edit. Thanks for all the replies. Ive often advised others not to lose hope, and I will now take that advice. Dark times overshadow at times but are not permanent. Hope you all know nobody is alone with this, thankyou again.
