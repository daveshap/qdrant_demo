FOLEY: Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
ZACK: Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
FOLEY: No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
ZACK: Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
FOLEY: Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
