TIM: Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
PONY: Whatever.
TIM: Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
PONY: Don't do that, man, okay?
SOOZE: Could you give me a ride?
TIM: Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
SOOZE: Tim, go throw up somewhere.
PONY: You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
TIM: It's none of my business?
PONY: Yeah.
TIM: Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
SOOZE: What the fuck are you talking about?!
PONY: Nobody's fucking anybody!
TIM: No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
PONY: Don't do that.
TIM: What are you going to do? Hm?
PONY: If you hit me...
TIM: Yeah?
PONY: ... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
TIM: Your manager?
PONY: Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
TIM: Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
PONY: Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
BUFF: Thanks, man!
PONY: I'll be in the car, okay?
JEFF: Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
SOOZE: I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
JEFF: Where are you going?
SOOZE: For a ride.
JEFF: Wait, away?
SOOZE: Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
JEFF: To his hotel?
SOOZE: Shit, Jeff!
BUFF: You know what we should do? Go to the...
JEFF: So you can do an album cover?
SOOZE: I've run out of words.
JEFF: Wait. What, what are you saying?
SOOZE: I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
JEFF: Well, what about us?
SOOZE: What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
JEFF: No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
SOOZE: Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
JEFF: Oh, no, no, no.
SOOZE: You're unbelievable.
JEFF: Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
SOOZE: You did, huh? Good for you.
JEFF: Oh, fuck it, man!
BUFF: Fuck it!
JEFF: You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
BUFF: In the limo!!!
JEFF: Do your covers and all that shit.
SOOZE: 'Bye, Jeff.
JEFF: Go.
SOOZE: What?
JEFF: Just go.
SOOZE: You really suck, you know that?
JEFF: Just go.
TIM: To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering
JEFF: I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
TIM: Good. That's good.
TIM: Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
JEFF: No.
TIM: Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
JEFF: What?
TIM: Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
JEFF: Yeah, fuck 'em.
TIM: No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
JEFF: Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
