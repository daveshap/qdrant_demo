My studies bore me, the girl I love lives thousands of miles away and I dont really know what I want
Hey folks, let me introduce myself first:

I'm a 17 year old aerospace engineering student from Germany. Although the following will sound cheesy as fuck (I know it is) bare with me:

About 2 months ago I met a girl on omegle and we've been talking twice a day for almost all the time now. A few weeks ago I confessed that I kinda like her (a bit more than that) and she admitted the same. To make it short: we basically confessed that we love each other. Whenever I'm talking with her I'm feeling great but lately it's starting to fill me with sadness because everytime we talk I realise that chances are that I'll never see her in person. It's gotten so far that it actually keeps me down for an entire weekend. 

Furthermore I've found out that aerospace engineering isn't what I really want to do and despite already having an alternative plan what to do, a friend of mine recently gave me the idea of maybe going to the US to study. But because tution fees are very high I've been looking for a scholarship online and haven't found one that's either realistic or relevant yet. I'm kind of afraid that our 'relationship' or whatever we have there will slowly but steadily fall apart. Obviously I don't want that to happen but I don't know how to prevent it either. I know it might just be stupid teenager love (and it probably is) but it still bothers me. 

I also don't know whether I should just accept my fate or try my hardest to travel to the US or maybe look to study in the US. 

By the way, on the last topic: does anyone know of scholarships for foreign students that can't afford to pay (the entire) tution fees?


Even if you don't have an answer for me, it just felt good to get this all of my chest and for those who read through it all: thank you
