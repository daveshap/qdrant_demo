How to find a remote job in the information technology field?
I'm currently working as a firefighter trying to switch to a career in IT. I have an A+ and Network+ cert, and live in small town that doesn't have many jobs. I thought of moving and applying for jobs in bigger cities like Charlotte, Dallas, LA, or NY; however, with the coronavirus idk if that would be possible. Could I find a remote job in IT considering I've never worked in the field before? Also, what sites could I use to find remote jobs. Also, would they pay anywhere near what I'm making now 40k of course I do around 70 to 90 hours a week at the fire department so the hourly pay only comes out to 12 to 15 dollars an hour.
