TERRI: Not quite. This wasn't here.
JP: No. But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it. You found a real treasure for me, Terri. I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
TERRI: Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
JP: Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up. Put her heart and soul into it.
TERRI: A girl? Anyone I should know?
JP: Not now, no. I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
TERRI: Yeah right. Look ...
JP: Terri, listen. Why don't you come here and kiss me? I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right? Is it going to happen? Isn't it going to happen? Let's get it out of the way. See how we feel. Then we can relax. Talk. You know.
TERRI: I don't think so. Not yet. I'm not ready yet.
JP: Sure. Sure. I understand. It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
JP: That's terrible. What a bitch. She was obviously just using you, Terri. Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
TERRI: No. It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know? Freaked her out. Just fucked up something good again.
JP: Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me. You know that. It was my fault, babe, it really was. And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now. I hate to see you in pain like this.
TERRI: Really?
JP: Yes! God, yes. I ... I just want to hug you. To hold you. To tell you it's alright.
