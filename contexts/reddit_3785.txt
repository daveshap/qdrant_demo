Online Dating would be better if..
You read their profile and then if you like their answers their pictures are then shown. Instead of the typical picture first then profile feature.

If you don't like the photos you can still swipe left. This isn't meant to discard looks.  It just focuses more on compatibility initially. 

Then if you see potential you see the photos. Then you can swipe right if you like the photos after the personality. Or swipe left you don't.
