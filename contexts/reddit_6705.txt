Pushy Recruiter
Hey all

I've been unemployed since December and have been hitting the road looking for jobs. A recruiter contacted me and asked if I would be interested in a position. Naturally I said yes while also applying for positions on my own.

I have now received offers from both the recruiter company and one I applied for myself. However, the recruiter is trying to guilt trip me into her job - You're trying to stall, you won't get more, I've worked hard to get you this etc.

Has anyone dealt with this before?  This is honestly the worst part of the job hunt moreso because I don't really like confrontation.

Thanks for reading
