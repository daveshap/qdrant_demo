During the midterms, Maine used the ranked-choice voting system which means "[V]oters rank their choices from first to last. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the first-place votes, then candidates are eliminated one by one -- making the second-place choices of voters who back little-known third-party or independent candidates crucial."  
Bruce Poliquin has challenged the results saying that the new system is unconstitutional.

My question is this:  Is the ranked-choice runoff electoral system constitutional?
