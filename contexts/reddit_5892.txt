Jobs checking education requirements
So I know it's not the right thing to do, but I fudged on my resume and said I had a bachelors degree. I do have a lot of education, about as many credits as a bachelors degree requires, just didn't get all the right ones. 

I've been offered the job. The job I have currently barely pays me enough to live off of, the new one pays significantly more. I lied because I knew I had plenty of experience, but companies weren't taking me seriously without the degree because I work in accounting. 

During the interview they seemed more interested in my work experience than education anyways. They ended up offering me more money then they advertised and said they were impressed with me. I'm already signed up for on-boarding, have signed my offer letter, and just filled out the Background check consent form.

I filled out the back ground check consent form and it states they will check: criminal, drug & dmv checks, and of course states that it may include other things, but I'm thinking since they didn't state it explicitly like the other things, it's not likely. 

The job does not legally require a degree, and the website stated that you could also have equivalent experience, which I have.

It's a large company. I read online that only 34% of companies verify education. Has anyone had experience with this? If it works my plan is to continue my education, get the degree, and since that'll take years, probably apply to a new job with the actual degree.
