Cute dates
Edit: please read the entire paragraph before commenting, Its not a long read. I feel like some people halfway read the first sentence and comment, completely missing the point.


Do people even like cute dates anymore? I’m NOT talking about spending a lot of money in a fancy restaurant that’s gonna cost $100. Dates like ice skating, which costs $15 for 2 people (on Groupon, live within your means, don’t break your bank if you don’t have to). Going to a museum, or to the park or the beach when the weather is nice, depending on where you live. I can’t speak for men, because I’m a girl, and I don’t really know if you guys even like cute dates, but I know a lot of ladies who would love this type of effort, but it’s hard to wade through the people (men and women) who just want to have sex and go. 

There are lots of cheap, or free venues for dates, why don’t we take advantage of it?
