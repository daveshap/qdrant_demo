does anyone else wake up with a sense of impending doom upon you?
it seems like every time i wake up in the morning i momentarily feel like i’m dying or spiraling out of control. i have almost a mini panic attack every time i wake up and then i have to ground myself and remind myself that i’m just waking up and everything is okay - does this happen to anyone else? it’s been very hard to deal with and almost makes me not want to go to bed at night because i know this will happen in the morning when i wake up. 

edit: 
woah. i did not expect to see this post get so many comments and upvotes - although it’s really heartbreaking to know all of you are experiencing this too i feel better knowing i’m not alone in this....this community has helped me a lot even though i’ve just been lurking for a while - i just wanna say thank you all. thanks for your comments and tips and i hope we can all get through this together, i wish all of you true peace and happiness ❤️
