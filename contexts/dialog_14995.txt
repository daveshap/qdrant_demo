BLEEKER: So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
JUNO: Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
BLEEKER: Really? What are they like?
JUNO: The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
BLEEKER: Is that normal?
JUNO: I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
BLEEKER: Oh. That's a relief.
JUNO: I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
BLEEKER: I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
JUNO: Jesus, Bleek.
BLEEKER: Well, I do.
BLEEKER: Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
JUNO: Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
BLEEKER: We could get back together too.
JUNO: Were we together?
BLEEKER: Well, we were once. You know, that time.
JUNO: What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
BLEEKER: I don't like Katrina.
JUNO: I totally heard you did.
BLEEKER: I don't. Katrina smells like soup. Her whole house smells of soup.
VANESSA: What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
MARK: They're yellow.
VANESSA: Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
MARK: Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
VANESSA: I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
MARK: Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
VANESSA: What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called nesting.""
MARK: Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
VANESSA: You should read the book. I even flagged the daddy chapters" for you."
MARK: I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
VANESSA: And I disagree.
VANESSA: That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
MARK: Hm.
VANESSA: Can you see it?
LEAH: Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
JUNO: Share the love, Tits!
