To My Mother
My mother obviously won't see this because well she's a 50 year old woman who wouldn't touch reddit. So here's just a little venting and things i'd never dare say to her:

In elementary school you called me thick-headed and hopeless. And no, not out of friendly teasing as you insist today. You'd watch me in legitimate disgust. 

In middle school I worked my hardest to please you and my father and it resulted in OCD towards school assignments and grades. I strived to be the perfect student. As a result I because anxious and shut everyone out of my life. At which point i was no longer thick-headed but instead you called me anti-social, awfully nerdy, a loner, pestered me on my weight (i was a "whopping" 80 pounds just btw.. wtf even), my looks, how i dressed, and decided i was just outright strange. 

My self esteem plummeted and by high school my grades dropped (I know- great timing right). The stellar student in me became a shell of what i once was. Now to you I have been distracted and academically challenged. Whenever we'd drive around Seattle by one of my reach schools (in-state) you'd laugh and say "Look, it's the school you'll never get into". You insisted i'd have to attend community college. 

Today I got into that reach school we would drive by, University of Washington. 
I only wish I could enjoy the acceptance without so much doubt and guilt. But I'm grateful that I have this opportunity. And although I will try my best not to allow your negativity to infiltrate this success, I love you mom. Thank you for everything.
