SAUNDERS: Tell me why!
DIZ: Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
SAUNDERS: When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
DIZ: Would you settle for a husband?
SAUNDERS: What's this, Diz?
DIZ: That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
SAUNDERS: Huh?
DIZ: You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
SAUNDERS: Oh--that again. Yeah.
DIZ: I would cherish you--and stay sober.
SAUNDERS: Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
DIZ: Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
SAUNDERS: No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
DIZ: You got worms.
SAUNDERS: What! Who?
DIZ: You know--little worms--ambition.
SAUNDERS: Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
