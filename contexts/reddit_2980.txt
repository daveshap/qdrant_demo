Do companies blacklist you if you keep applying?
If I apply to multiple jobs for the same company over a period of time and don't get considered for the position, how likely is it that they just skip over my name because they remember seeing that I'm not good enough multiple times before? I don't want to ruin my chances at bigger companies before I even start applying.
