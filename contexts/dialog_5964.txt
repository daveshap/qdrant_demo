MR. ROSE: Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
HOMER: What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
MR. ROSE: Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
MR. ROSE: That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
JACK: Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
MR. ROSE: It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
JACK: You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
MR. ROSE: What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
