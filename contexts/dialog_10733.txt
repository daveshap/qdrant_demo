ROBERTA: These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
ENID: Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
ROBERTA: Did you actually do this painting?
ENID: Well, no - it's more like a found art object.""
ROBERTA: And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
ENID: It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
ROBERTA: And how does an image like this help us to see that?
ENID: I'm not sure... I mean... I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
