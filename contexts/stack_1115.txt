Internal Stored Procedure Failure - ID_TransUserActionCreate On a SQL Server 2014 12.0.4237.0 system, the following errors have been logged periodically (11 times in past 66 days):  <blockquote>  2018-03-22 09:28:11.170 Error: 50101, Severity: 16, State: 10.<br>  2018-03-22 09:28:11.170 Internal Stored Procedure Failure -  ID_TransUserActionCreate - SQL Error Number 0    </blockquote>As yet I haven't found any reference to an error with code 50101, and Google, amazingly, returns absolutely nothing for \"ID_TransUserActionCreate\".As far as \"what's happening at the time this is logged,\" I don't know yet as there are several databases on the system and we haven't yet started collecting detailed information to answer that question.  So this question is to ask if anyone knows, or has a good idea, what this message means and/or if it is something I should be concerned with.
