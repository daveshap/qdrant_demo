KAFKA: You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant. When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
INSPECTOR: That's been noted. But where does it lead us? Unless you have something more to add.
KAFKA: She's missing. I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
