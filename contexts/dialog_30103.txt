THE KID: Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
MUNNY: What business?
THE KID: An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself. Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
MUNNY: Well... I don't recollect.
THE KID: You don't recollect!
THE KID: Say, Ned... ?
NED: Yeah.
THE KID: How many men you killed? Ain't you gonna answer?
NED: I don't like the question.
THE KID: Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
NED: How many you killed, Kid?
THE KID: Five. I killed five of 'em. That counts a Mexican I killed. He come at me with a knife.
MUNNY: Get some sleep, Kid.
THE KID: You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
