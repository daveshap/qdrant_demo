LELAND: Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?"
BERNSTEIN: Sure. They're like anybody else. They got work to do. They do it. Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
