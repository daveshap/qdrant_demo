LIZZY: Tommy, let's put the tape on.
TOMMY: Now?
LIZZY: Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
TOMMY: Fuck, OK.
RENTON: Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
DIANE: Right. You can't sleep here.
RENTON: What?
DIANE: Out.
RENTON: Come on.
DIANE: No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
RENTON: Jesus.
DIANE: And don't make any noise.
LIZZY: What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
TOMMY: It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
LIZZY: Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick.
