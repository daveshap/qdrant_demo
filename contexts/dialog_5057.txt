EBBY: We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
CRASH: Shut up--I like this song... April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
EBBY: She's playing with my mind.
CRASH: It's a damn easy thing to play with.
ANNIE: Well--you boys stopped fighting yet? Are you pals now? Good. I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares
EBBY: Which one of us?
ANNIE: Oh both of you, of course...
ANNIE: These are the ground rules. I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training... And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far. So... I thought we should get to know each other.
CRASH: Why do you get to choose? Why don't I get to choose?
ANNIE: Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction. There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
EBBY: Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
ANNIE: You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
CRASH: After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout. Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
ANNIE: What do you believe in?
CRASH: I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap. I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the sweet spot"
ANNIE: Oh my... Don't leave...
CRASH: G'night.
