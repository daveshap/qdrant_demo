How do I make my sister feel better after she got rejected?
My sister is really nervous in terms of partners, and after encouragement from us and our actual waiter, she gave her number to another waiter who had been flirting with her all night. And he never texted her and now sheâ€™s really crushed, and I feel awful because I encouraged her. How can I make her feel better?
