REBECCA: Can't sleep?
DAVID LEE: No, ma'am... Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
REBECCA: So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
DAVID LEE: I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
REBECCA: But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
DAVID LEE: Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
REBECCA: No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im. The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
DAVID LEE: Can I go day after tomorrow?
REBECCA: Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
DAVID LEE: Good night, Mama...
REBECCA: Good night...
