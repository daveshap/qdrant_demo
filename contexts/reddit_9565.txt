Is anyone else feeling burned out as a result of working from home?
Since March, our institution has been functioning remotely. I advise students and while they have never been a problem, doing this remotely allows the parents to be within earshot. Every week I deal with a new angry parent who is frustrated for xyz reasons (depts are not answering their phones, the wait times are ridiculous, certain processes not being fulfilled in their usual time frame, etc). The parents (usually the mothers) take it out on me because I’m the person who has a scheduled appointment with their son/daughter.  By the time they get to me, they are upset and trashing the entire institution and I just have to sit there and let them vent. I’m supposed to be dealing with the students directly but these parents (who are seemingly also at home) always monopolize the conversation. I’m getting so frustrated and tired. I’ve been very happy at the job, but lately I think about looking for something else. Has anyone else felt this low?
