GLORIA: What do you want?
CHANG: I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
GLORIA: You get out of here! If any of you men think you can come busting in here-
CHANG: Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
GLORIA: I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
CHANG: I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
GLORIA: No doctors? That's fine. That's just fine.
CHANG: Please let me help you.
GLORIA: Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
CHANG: You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
GLORIA: Don't preach that cheap, second- hand stuff to me! Go on, beat it. Beat it!
