How can I enable topological editing in QGIS 3 How can I enable topological editing (create shared nodes on adjacent polygons or intersecting lines) and also activate the option to prevent polygon overlap (that when a new polygon is drawn, its portions that overlap on pre existing polygons is automatically removed) in QGIS version 3? In prior versions these setting were found in Settings->Snapping Options menu.
