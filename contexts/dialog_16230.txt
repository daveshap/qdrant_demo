BACON: Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
EDDY: The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
TOM: What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
NICK: Of course you are. All right, Ed.
