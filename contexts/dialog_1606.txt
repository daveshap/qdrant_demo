ANNIE: We can digest our-
ALVY: Okay. Yeah.
ALVY: I'm gonna have a corned beef.
ANNIE: Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce. Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
ALVY: Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
ANNIE: Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
ALVY: My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
ANNIE: Oh.
ANNIE: M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
ALVY: As Balzac said...
ANNIE: H'm?
ALVY: There goes another novel." Jesus
ANNIE: Oh, yeah?
ALVY: Yeah.
ANNIE: Yeah?
ALVY: Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
ANNIE: No. You're a wreck.
ALVY: Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
ANNIE: You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
ALVY: Good? I was-
ANNIE: No.
ALVY: No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
ANNIE: Here, you want some?
ALVY: No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
ANNIE: Yeah?
ALVY: I tried to take my pants off over my head... ...my ear.
ANNIE: Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
ALVY: M'hm. You're not gonna believe this, but-
ANNIE: What? What?
ALVY: Hey?
ANNIE: H'm?
ALVY: I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
ANNIE: That's, uh... that's pretty serious stuff there.
ALVY: Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
ANNIE: Yeah?
ALVY: big subject with me, yeah.
ANNIE: Yeah?
ALVY: I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
ANNIE: M'hm.
ALVY: Those are the two categories...
ANNIE: M'hm.
ALVY: ...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
ANNIE: M'hm.
ALVY: And blind people, crippled...
ANNIE: Yeah.
ALVY: I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
ANNIE: M'hm.
ALVY: You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be... ...to be miserable.
ANNIE: U-huh.
ALVY: Look, look at that guy.
ANNIE: M'hm.
ALVY: There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know? He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
ANNIE: M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
ALVY: Look at these guys.
ANNIE: Yeah.
ALVY: Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
ANNIE: Oh! Italian, right?
ALVY: Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
ANNIE: Oh, yeah.
ALVY: No, I'm serious. I just got my mustache wet.
ANNIE: Oh, yeah?
ALVY: And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
ANNIE: You see, like you and I...
ALVY: You are extremely sexy.
ANNIE: No, I'm not.
ALVY: Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
ANNIE: Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
ALVY: Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
ANNIE: Ooooh!
ALVY: You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
ANNIE: Come on. Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
ALVY: You- Do you love me?
ANNIE: Do I love you?
ALVY: That's the key question.
ANNIE: Yeah.
ALVY: I know you've only known me a short while.
ANNIE: Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah... yeah. Do you love me?
ALVY: I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
ANNIE: Yeah.
ALVY: I love you. You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you. I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
ANNIE: Yeah.
ALVY: Don't you think I do?
ANNIE: I dunno.
ALVY: Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
ANNIE: Of course.
ALVY: Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
ANNIE: Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
ALVY: Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
ANNIE: I have a tiny apartment.
ALVY: Yeah, I know it's small.
ANNIE: That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
ALVY: All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a... ...rapidly growing field.
ANNIE: You don't want me to live with you?
ALVY: How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
ANNIE: Mine.
ALVY: Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
ANNIE: I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?
ALVY: No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
ANNIE: How is it any different?
ALVY: It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment. Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
ANNIE: That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
ALVY: That place is four hundred dollars a month?
ANNIE: Yes, it is.
ALVY: It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
ANNIE: You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
ALVY: Hey, don't be ridiculous.
ANNIE: Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
ALVY: 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
ANNIE: Does this sound like a good course? Uh, Modern American Poetry"? Uh
ALVY: Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
ANNIE: What? Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
ALVY: No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for? You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
ANNIE: Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
ALVY: Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
ANNIE: Well, have you ever made love high?
ALVY: Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
ANNIE: It relaxes me.
ALVY: Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
ANNIE: Well, what's the difference, anyway?
ALVY: Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
ANNIE: Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
ALVY: Oh, come, you don't need that.
ANNIE: What are you doing?
ALVY: No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
ANNIE: Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please. M'mrnm.
ALVY: M'm, wait, I got a great idea. Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect. I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there. M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
ANNIE: Uh-uh-why?
ALVY: I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
ANNIE: No, I'm fine.
ALVY: Really?
ANNIE: U-huh.
ALVY: I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
ANNIE: Let's just do it, all right?
ALVY: Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
