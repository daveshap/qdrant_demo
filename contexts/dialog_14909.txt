LOU: Time?
JIM: Between six and seven seconds.
LOU: The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing. The other problem is there was a tree right there... Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
JIM: Didn't Hoover say something about that? The leaves had fallen off in November?
LOU: It was a Texas Live Oak, boss. It sheds it's leaves the first week of March. You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon. No way. The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance. Not one. And Oswald was at best a medium shot. The scope was defective on it, too. I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me. The guy couldn't do the shooting. Nobody could. And they sold this lemon to the American public.
JIM: The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou. We gotta get our hands on it.
LOU: That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
JIM: Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston? There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
