WALLS: This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term menace to society" was made up for him."
FRANK: He's crazy. He can't help it.
WALLS: Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
WALLS: Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
FRANK: Okay, whatta I do?
WALLS: If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
FRANK: That's ridiculous.
WALLS: Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
FRANK: You learn that in the army?
