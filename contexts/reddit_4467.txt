It will be ok

hey. you

you might not be in the best of spots in life right now. you might be the happiest you've ever been in life. that is beautiful. for those who aren't feeling so great right now, i need you to know that things get better. i cant stop you from the nights you cry yourself to sleep. I cannot stop you from the days where it feels like no one loves you. one day you will be happy. and you will look back on this. i promise. talk to a friend, get some sleep, drink some water, have some of your favorite candy, play some videogames, go for a walk around the block. do what makes you happy. 

someone out there cares for you. 

it might not be that girl you've been crushing on since freshman year. it might not be someone you feel sad over right now. 

but someone cares. 

Even I care and I donâ€™t even know you.

you just need to look for that person, and I promise you will find that person. 

just remember
everything you've ever done has led you to this comment. you've made it this far. 


don't give up now.
