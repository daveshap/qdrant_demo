AARON: Me again. Hi. Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything. When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
JANE: Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
AARON: You're welcome. Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too. We're very busy here.
TOM: ...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
AARON: Nice, Jane.
