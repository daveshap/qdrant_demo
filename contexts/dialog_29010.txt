BRETT: Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
MCKINNEY: Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap?
SALLY: It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
MCKINNEY: Good night!
BRETT: Good night, Mrs. Brett!
SALLY: Good night, idiot!
MCKINNEY: How about you?
BRETT: No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
MCKINNEY: You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
BRETT: Why?
MCKINNEY: Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
BRETT: Sure, I'll go.
MCKINNEY: I'll go with you.
BRETT: Swell!
