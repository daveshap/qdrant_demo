Ever hooked up with someone you had a major crush on but never thought in a million years that they would be interested?
This happened to me a couple days ago. She was a former work colleague who I’ve really really fancied for a while but never in my wildest dreams did I think I had a chance. But we’d been flirting for a couple weeks via text and then it actually happened. I don’t know if I’ve ever had a dream come true before, but this was actually it!

Let’s hear your stories!
