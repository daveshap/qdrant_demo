ELLEN: All he did was kiss me....
CARLA: It's beginning....
ELLEN: Beginning of what?
CARLA: Whatever happens next.....
ELLEN: I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
CARLA: Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
ELLEN: Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
CARLA: Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
ELLEN: I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it... It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
THEA: You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
CARLA: Yes, I did.
THEA: It's time for tea, Grandma.
ELLEN: I almost forgot....
THEA: I didn't.
THEA: I put everything in my room. My Teddy bear is joining us.
ELLEN: Thanks for the consultation....
