Loneliness is taking over me
I never realized how much I rely on having human contact and connection. I recently went through my first heartbreak and I lost a best friend and I’m losing my other friend. I feel like neither of them cared about me as much as I cared about them. 

I feel like everybody has somebody that loves them back and for some reason that makes me feel worse. I feel like I give my heart entirely to people and it hurts so badly when it’s not reciprocated in the end. I know that’s selfish of me but I wish I knew what I was doing wrong. 

I feel so alone and all I wish I could have was a genuine human connection. It doesn’t have to be romantic. Just to have someone be there and not leave me. 

My depression is coming back and the negative thoughts are even worse than before. For the first time I’ve really thought about giving up on life because I feel so useless and not good enough. 

I have one friend left but I’m afraid to rely on someone to make me happy. I know it isn’t fair. We talked and he made me feel better but when we don’t talk the emotions come back. 


How can I be happy with being alone. I don’t know what to do. I just want to feel hope and happy with myself. All I do is sleep because the days are too painful to live through.
