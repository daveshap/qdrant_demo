KINDERMAN: Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
CHRIS: Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
KINDERMAN: I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?"
CHRIS: When she's well enough, I'll ask.
KINDERMAN: Couldn't hurt. In the meantime...
KINDERMAN: I hate to ask you this but... for my daughter could you maybe give an autograph?
CHRIS: Of course. Have you got a pen?
KINDERMAN: Oh, she'd love it.
CHRIS: What's her name?
KINDERMAN: I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
CHRIS: Really? wow.
