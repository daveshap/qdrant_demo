BILLY-BOY: Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out. I'll be fine... okay? How 'bout that... ? Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!! Lemme out of this coffin!!
KITTLE: Clench your teeth.
BILLY-BOY: Wh... what... ?!
KITTLE: Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
