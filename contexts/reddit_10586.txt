how do you even respond to a suicide hotline when they ask “how can i help you”
i don’t know!!! i don’t know how to answer that!! there’s probably nothing you can personally do to make sure i don’t off myself tonight!!! 

normally if the person picks up and says how can i help you i just hang back up

tonight i tried to call them three times over the span of a few hours and i just don’t even know how to start a conversation 

maybe it’s a sign from god or some shit that i really should just throw myself off the bridge next time
