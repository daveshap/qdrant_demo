I got offered a new job which means Iâ€™m going to have to resign from my current role while in isolation. How should I approach this?
Before we went into isolation, I was interviewing for another role and had my last interview around about the same time most businesses converted to working from home. 

They then called me to say that thereâ€™s a recruitment freeze and it would probably be a while before Iâ€™d hear back from them. 

I was relieved about this as my current employer has been really good to me throughout this whole isolation process and I didnâ€™t want to have to resign during this time.

I received a call today to say that I basically had the position (pending reference checks) as the CEO of their company called off the recruitment freeze. 

Iâ€™m super happy about this as itâ€™s exactly what I wanted before isolation began - the role is way more pay, in an industry im passionate about and close to home - but now Iâ€™m in an awkward position where Iâ€™m probably going to have to resign via email or zoom from my current employer. 

Iâ€™m having a lot of anxiety about resigning due to the fact my current employer has treated me really well, theyâ€™ve ensured my job security throughout lockdown and also itâ€™s a â€˜cushyâ€™ job. 

But I also really want this other position and I wonâ€™t be able to wait it out until the end of lockdown to take it as I doubt it would still be available.

What is the best way for me to approach this? 

Ahhhh help ðŸ˜¢
