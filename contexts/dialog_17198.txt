MRS. PILLETTI: Hello, Marty, when you come home?
MARTY: We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
MRS. PILLETTI: Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
CLARA: No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
MRS. PILLETTI: Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
MARTY: How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
MRS. PILLETTI: Oh, it's a sad business. My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
MARTY: Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
MRS. PILLETTI: Oh, sure. Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
MARTY: Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
MRS. PILLETTI: Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
MARTY: I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
CLARA: No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
MRS. PILLETTI: It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
CLARA: Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
MRS. PILLETTI: Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
CLARA: You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
MRS. PILLETTI: You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
CLARA: Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
MRS. PILLETTI: Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
CLARA: I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
MRS. PILLETTI: Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
CLARA: It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
MARTY: Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
MRS. PILLETTI: Sure.
CLARA: It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
MRS. PILLETTI: Sure.
MARTY: All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.
MRS. PILLETTI: Sure.
CLARA: Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
MRS. PILLETTI: Goodnight.
