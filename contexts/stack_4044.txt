Virgin Australia and Swiss Airlines frequent flyer points On Virgin Australia's Velocity Frequent Flyer program (gold status), if I fly Singapore Airline and Swiss Airlines in a multi ticket business class, will I get points and status credits?This frequent flyer program is not specifically in Star Alliance but I can easily join up with miles and bonus or KrisFlyer. There is also a Qantas flight in there but let's not confuse the problem.
