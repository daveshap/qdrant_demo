Is it quite weird to send the recruiter with the updated resume?
I recently got referred through one of my contacts to a recruiter, but they happened to have forwarded the resume of mine which is old, will it be odd if I reach out the recruiter saying that I've attached the updated version of my resume and wanted them to have the same, or something along the lines?
