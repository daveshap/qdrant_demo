throwing a well deserved ap rager
all these AP student nerds at my school gon be going to top 20 colleges but don't know how to party so I have decided to throw an AP student rager as an prom after party to teach him how. 

Here are my ideas so far: 

* They must bring their transcripts to the party. I will be checking GPA's at the door (4.5 weighted and above only😛)
* A shot for every school you've applied to 
* AP Chem students who got a 5 get to tend the bar
   * They also get first pass on the weed but they have to thoroughly explain the combustion reaction formula happening as they take a hit
* Girls (who are National Merit Scholars) get in free😜👏
* USC commits have to pay to get in.
* Leave the drama😤at home😴(no college shaming)

Obviously this post is satirical but this party is actually happening so some aspects of this will be used...please drop down any other AP/tryhard/nerd themed ideas bc I'd really appreciate it for my party
