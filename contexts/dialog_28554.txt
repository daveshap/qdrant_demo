PHILBY: What happened to Emma will never go away. It's part of you now and it always will be. But you have to learn to live with it...
ALEXANDER: I live with it every minute of every day.
PHILBY: I know that --
ALEXANDER: You don't know that. You couldn't possibly. If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later. If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring. You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
PHILBY: It wasn't your fault, Alex.
ALEXANDER: Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now. The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story? In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger. I have to make the decision. Which door conceals Emma? And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
PHILBY: Do you find her?
PHILBY: Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
ALEXANDER: That's where you're wrong. I will change it.
ALEXANDER: David... I appreciate your concern, I do. But I ask you to have faith in me. Just for a little while longer. I'm working on something now. Something... extraordinary.
PHILBY: What is it?
ALEXANDER: You wouldn't believe me.
PHILBY: I would.
ALEXANDER: I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
PHILBY: Why don't you come to our house instead?
ALEXANDER: I can't do that --
PHILBY: When's the last time you were outside this house -- -- or this room?
ALEXANDER: I can't leave when I'm so close.
PHILBY: There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes. A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them. Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
ALEXANDER: That's absurd --
PHILBY: You're dying here. Don't you see that?!
ALEXANDER: You won't say that in a week.
PHILBY: I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
PHILBY: All right. I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
ALEXANDER: In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
ALEXANDER: Good night, David.
PHILBY: Good night, Alex.
