MRS. BEAUMONT: I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
JEFFREY: Well. Okay.
MRS. BEAUMONT: Jeffrey, when you see your father.
JEFFREY: Yeah?
MRS. BEAUMONT: He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
JEFFREY: What?
MRS. BEAUMONT: It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
JEFFREY: Thanks a lot, Mom.
MRS. BEAUMONT: .Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
AUNT BARBARA: I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
JEFFREY: Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
