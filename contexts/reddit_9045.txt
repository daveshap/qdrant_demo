What is the factual basis for President Trump's allegations regarding a "spy" in his campaign? What if any are the legal implications of those allegations?
In a series of tweets this morning, [President Trump said:](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/999096011174924289)

>If the person placed very early into my campaign wasnâ€™t a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal......Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion. He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders, who got duped!

Press accounts [describe this as a reference to Stefan Halper, a professor who had contacts with some Trump campaign advisers.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/spygate-trump-steps-up-attacks-on-fbis-probes-during-campaign/2018/05/23/3702510e-5e6f-11e8-9ee3-49d6d4814c4c_story.html?utm_term=.6a7e43abf3bb) The [Washington Post recently published this piece on who Halper is.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/who-is-stefan-a-halper-the-fbi-source-who-assisted-the-russia-investigation/2018/05/21/22c46caa-5d42-11e8-9ee3-49d6d4814c4c_story.html?utm_term=.a636f8adcaf2)

A former lawyer for Trump has said that [these claims are "more than sufficient basis to challenge"](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/may/21/stefan-halper-fbi-informant-revelation-underscores/) the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Critics have described Trump's assertions as ["completely insane,"](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/05/trumps-fbi-russia-scandal-spy-theory-mueller-insane.html) and as Jonathan Chait argues:

>This does not explain why the FBI failed to announce either the results of its spying campaign, or even the existence of the investigation, in time to help Clinton win, rather than allowing the probe to remain secret until well after the election. 

Robert Mueller [was appointed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/967231/download) by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "to conduct the investigation confirmed by then-FBI
Director James B. Comey in testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence on March 20, 2017, including: any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals
associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump."

* What do we know about the conduct of Mr. Halper?

* Is there anything unlawful alleged in Mr. Halper's conduct directly, or in the FBI coordinating with him in respect to investigating the conduct of advisers to the Trump campaign, or their contacts with the Russian government?
