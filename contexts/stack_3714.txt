What is the difference between segmented regression analysis and cate-nelson analysis? I observed a possible inflection point for my dataset and was introduced to segmented regression analysis and cate-nelson analysis. The segmented regression analysis seems to fit better for my dataset. I would like to know what is the theoretical difference between these two types of analysis? How do I decide or justify which analytical tool to use?
