GRANT: Billy!
PAUL: It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
PAUL: My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
AMANDA: You couldn't have made that jump.
PAUL: I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
AMANDA: How would you have helped Eric? He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
PAUL: He could have died.
AMANDA: But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
ERIC: Do you have any kids?
GRANT: No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
GRANT: I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
ERIC: I want to be an astronaut.
GRANT: See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
ERIC: But then you never get to go in space.
GRANT: Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
