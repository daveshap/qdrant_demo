CASPER: Nah.
TELLY: Why not? You stink.
CASPER: That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
TELLY: Mom.
MOM: Shh.
TELLY: I'm gonna go out for a little while.
MOM: When are you gonna be back?
TELLY: Not too late.
MOM: Four-thirty in the morning?
TELLY: Not too late.
TELLY: Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
MOM: If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
TELLY: All right.
