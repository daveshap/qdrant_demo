HARDY: It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
STYLES: What are you talking about?
HARDY: If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
STYLES: You're drunk --
HARDY: I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
