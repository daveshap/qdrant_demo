CARTER: How you doing, baby? My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
ISABELLA: Isabella Molina, from San Juan. That seat is taken.
CARTER: San Juan! You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
ISABELLA: I don't think so.
CARTER: I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles. But hey, I understand. Make yourself at home, Isabella. Champagne, caviar, whatever you want. My ship is your ship.
ISABELLA: This is your ship?
CARTER: That's right. I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
ISABELLA: El Capitan?
CARTER: I don't want to play games with you, Isabella. I like you. I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
ISABELLA: Well, I'm very tempted. It's such a beautiful yacht. What's it called?
CARTER: Called? What's my ship called? Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
ISABELLA: The S.S. Minow Johnson. Funny, the name on the back was Red Dragon.""
CARTER: Red Dragon? You sure about that?
ISABELLA: I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht. And it's his party.
CARTER: Your friend's ship? Oh, man. I must've walked onto the wrong yacht. I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
