How common is it back out of accepting a job offer?
I am having a lot of second thoughts about taking a job with a start up. I had some red flags about their hiring process and realized that it may not actually be in line with my career goals in the way that I thought.

How common is it for people to back out of accepting an offer or even working the position for a month before leaving?
