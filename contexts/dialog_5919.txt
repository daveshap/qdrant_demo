GITTES: Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill. Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
WALSH: Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
GITTES: Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you? Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.
ESCOBAR: Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
GITTES: Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
ESCOBAR: Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
GITTES: Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
ESCOBAR: I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
GITTES: Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
ESCOBAR: Gittes, stay outta this.
