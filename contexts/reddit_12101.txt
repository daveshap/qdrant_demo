Can't be happy without my girlfriend
My girlfriend is Muslim, and has very strict parents who don't let her out much. Were both 16, we've been dating for 9 months now. I care about her very much, so much to where I can't bring myself to be happy or do anything other than mope when I'm not with her. I don't see her very often so this happens a lot. I need to find a way to be able to be productive/ happy even when I'm not with her.
