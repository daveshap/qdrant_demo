SYBOK: Qual se tu?
BEING: It is I. The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
SYBOK: It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
BEING: Magnificent. You are the first to find me.
SYBOK: We sought only your infinite wisdom.
BEING: And how did you breach the Barrier?
SYBOK: With a starship!
BEING: This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
SYBOK: It could. Yes.
BEING: Then I shall make use of this starship.
SYBOK: It will be your chariot!
