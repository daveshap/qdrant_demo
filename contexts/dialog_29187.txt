VIPER: The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
JESTER: Just below ten thousand.
VIPER: But you continued to fight.
VIPER: Why?
MAVERICK: We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
VIPER: The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
