What are the practical implications of the HUD's findings in their March 1st report, finding $500b discrepancies in previous year annual reporting, how does this happen (at this level of discrepancy), and does it happen often?
See the report here [https://www.hudoig.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017-FO-0005.pdf](https://www.hudoig.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017-FO-0005.pdf)	
From the landing page at [HUD website](https://www.hudoig.gov/reports-publications/audit-reports/hud%E2%80%99s-fiscal-years-2016-and-2015-restated-consolidated-financial)

A $500b discrepancy has been found (for years 2015 & 2016, under Obama administration).

It is also interesting to note that this document was prompted by an Independent Audit Report was issued on 15 November 2016 by Office of Inspector General which initiated the reissue of the Financial Statements for the two years, not by the current administration - but after the 2016 election results.

Regarding the discrepancies stated in the report - is this level of inaccuracy common?

And secondly, what is the routine from the OIG with regards to such independent audit reports - i.e. how often and in what instances are such reports conducted?

Finally, what is the implications of such a finding in a practical sense - do we have any prior examples to compare this to, and what was the outcomes of such findings?
