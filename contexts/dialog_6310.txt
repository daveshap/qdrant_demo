MILES: This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
GORDO: People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
JAKE: It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
MILES: Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
JAKE: Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
MILES: We never had a problem with that before.
JAKE: Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
MILES: What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
JAKE: We're getting a little old for running.
MILES: Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like twenty-five to life" pissed."
JAKE: I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
GORDO: Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
JAKE: No, not whatever." You're either in or you're out."
