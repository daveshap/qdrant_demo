So today I decided to ask a girl out for coffee the first time
She said that she didn't know what my plans were but that she already has a boyfriend. Also that she's still probably down for coffee. I declined because I didn't want to interfere with any of that. I'm glad it wasn't bad.. Though I struggled to get the words out which was probably hilarious. And apocalyptically cringe worthy. 

All in all, 9.9/10 would recommend just taking the plunge. Psyche yourself up, do whatever you have to do. I won't lie it stung a bit, but a few minutes later I was back. Maybe it'll be slightly awkward when I see her again but I'm past caring. Next time I like a girl enough to embarrass myself for, I'll be posting againüëç

Edit: Honestly it feels like some of you are more hurt than I was. And I'm sorry about that. This is a tough situation and everything can't have a Hollywood ending.. But we move on:)
