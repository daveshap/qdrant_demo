CASTOR: Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
ARCHER: And how much will your fun" net you this time?"
CASTOR: What's it to you? I declare it. Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
ARCHER: You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
CASTOR: What're you gonna do with me gone? You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
ARCHER: Mention my family once more and you're dead.
CASTOR: You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
ARCHER: You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
CASTOR: Don't count on it.
