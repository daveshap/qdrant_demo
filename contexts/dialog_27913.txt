KIKI: It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower. Click — click — click.
ELOISE: She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
KIKI: Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
ELOISE: You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
KIKI: Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
ELOISE: You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
KIKI: Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
