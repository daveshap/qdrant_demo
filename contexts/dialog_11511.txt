KRINGELEIN: What's the matter?
FLAEMMCHEN: Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
KRINGELEIN: You loved the Baron, didn't you?
FLAEMMCHEN: Yes --
KRINGELEIN: So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
FLAEMMCHEN: Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
KRINGELEIN: He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
FLAEMMCHEN: I didn't like Preysing right off.
KRINGELEIN: Then why did you have anything to do with him?
FLAEMMCHEN: Money!
KRINGELEIN: Yes, of course, -- money!
FLAEMMCHEN: You don't understand that do you?
KRINGELEIN: Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know -- I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
FLAEMMCHEN: What?
KRINGELEIN: You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
FLAEMMCHEN: Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
KRINGELEIN: Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
FLAEMMCHEN: Later?
KRINGELEIN: When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
FLAEMMCHEN: Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
KRINGELEIN: Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
FLAEMMCHEN: Oh yes, of course.
KRINGELEIN: Do you like me better?
FLAEMMCHEN: You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
