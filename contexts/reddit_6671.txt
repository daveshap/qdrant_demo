Why do recruiters keep ghosting me and sending me spam?
I know recruiters are busy people, but it takes 30 seconds to look at someone’s profile and work out their level of experience and their job history.
I’ve had recruiters that reach out wanting to “know what you’re looking for” but giving no info about any specific opportunity, I’ve had recruiters offer me positions I am in no way qualified for, I’ve had recruiters ask for a CV and a time to call but never respond to my messages.
In one extreme example I had a recruiter reach out to me, after a brief text exchange he asked for a copy of my CV and for a good time to call the next day. I sent the CV and suggested a reasonable time and never heard anything. Six weeks later I got a new “I am working with some great clients” message from the same person asking for the information I had given him in the previous message.

I’ve seen recruiters complain about jobseekers and the way they are treated, I get you guys are VERY busy but to ghost job hunters or to send us messages that are effectively spam does not help. So why do you do it?
