My work expects me to literally sit and do nothing most of the day. How do I handle this?
I work in a machine shop doing CNC grinding (essentially computer controlled machines that grind metal parts to bring them to certain sizes), and up until now, the night shift I work on has been allowed to read or use our phones while the machines are running. Well, they've decided to change that recently. They have decided that they are going to watch the cameras to make sure we aren't doing anything non work related while the machines run. 

My complaint is that the machines I run have anywhere from 30 mins to 4 hours to complete one part; usually it's about one hour. I work a 10 hour shift. There is literally nothing work related I can do in that time; cleaning takes 15 mins and doesn't need to be done every night. I've already read the books we have about the machines and the grinding processes about 15 times over when I first got hired. The machines don't need any human interference while they're running, but we do have to be near them so we know when they're done. 

The argument from the higher ups is that we're getting paid to work and not anything else. The conclusion I've come to is they're expecting us to sit there literally doing nothing while the machines run. I don't know about anyone else, but I cannot sit around doing absolutely nothing for an average of an hour at a time; it is mind numbing and essentially virtually impossible (I also have ADHD on top of this). How do I handle this going forward? I want to be a good employee and not get fired, but I also don't want to be treated like a robot since that isn't what any of the employees are.
