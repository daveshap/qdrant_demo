RAY: This Jimmy's?
MAGGIE: You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
RAY: Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
MAGGIE: Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
RAY: He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
MAGGIE: -- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
RAY: Who did?
MAGGIE: You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
RAY: A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
MAGGIE: Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
RAY: Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
MAGGIE: I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
