I think I need someone to kick my ass.
     Well not literally. I just think I need a good kick in the rear so get me motivated. So I am nearing the end of my first year and I have made very little progress. I have some home life issues that have been affecting me but I don’t want to talk about that here, that situation is improving. 

     Now though, I’m at the point where I have no more reasons not to be reading for my masters/dissertation but I continue to just sit on my ass. I have a really clear idea of what I want to study and have a number of specific questions and research ideas, so I don’t have the excuse of just not having a clear direction. My department is great and everyone is friendly and helpful, so can’t say that there is an issue there. I have a good work space, I have good support, I’m not too worried about my finances, I’m not undergoing an identity crisis. I have previous research experience/publications, so I can’t say I am lost in the sense of not having experience to get started. I have, at this point, no good excuses for why I’m not working on my research. If I were describing my behavior from an outside perspective I would say that I’m just sitting around basking in pity and wasting the opportunity that I’ve been given. 

Can somebody please tell me how stupid I’m being and what an incredible regret this is going to be for me if I don’t stop being lazy?
