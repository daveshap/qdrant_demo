Copy Ubuntu Server 18.04 to other Ubuntu Machine Am having Ubuntu Server 18.04 core with LAMP and other supporting packages installed. I want to migrate all of its content files and installed packages to a other machine with the same Ubuntu Server 18.04 core. I want this new machine to perform exactly as the older machine.Please note: I don't know what other packages are installed in it, how can i perform this?
