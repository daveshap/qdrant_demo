Advice on masters programs? (Specifically UCONN)
So I'm a junior currently at U of MN and I've suddenly realized I want to go into student affairs this semester. 

I have a History and Native American Indigenous Studies double major and a Deaf Studies minor and will be graduating with honors unless something goes terribly wrong in the next three semesters. 

I currently work for TRiO as a peer mentor where I create programing for first year students who are low income, first gen, minority background, or disabled. I really love my work and want to do something similar for my career. 

I know I for sure want to attend a grad program in New England for family reasons and have been looking into University of Connecticut's program. I was wondering if anyone had any reviews or opinions on programs in the area. I was originally considering HGSE at Harvard but I realized the program wasn't the right match for me.
