Is there such a switch? I am looking for a single 12V DC switch which has an on-off-on actuator that will do the following: two 12 volt+ input pins completely separate from each other, each with its own two loads. In other words, when switch is in up position, only ONE power source in with two loads going out. The same would be true for the down position. The two power sources should never share the load together. I am wanting to run two 12V devices from one switch using two separate power sources. I hope this makes sense! :-) Smiles
