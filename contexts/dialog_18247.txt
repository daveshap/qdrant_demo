BOBO: I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
MR. JOHNNY: I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
LORETTA: What about the wedding?
MR. JOHNNY: My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
LORETTA: How near is she to death?
MR. JOHNNY: A week. Two weeks. No more.
LORETTA: Then let's set the date.
LORETTA: How about a month from today?
MR. JOHNNY: Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
LORETTA: Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
MR. JOHNNY: Alright. A month. In a month.
LORETTA: A month from today?
MR. JOHNNY: Yeah.
LORETTA: I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
AVA: Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
GREGORY: No, I'm going.
AVA: The Shawfish?
GREGORY: Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
AVA: Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
GREGORY: I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
