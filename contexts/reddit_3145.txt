How can I consider my boss's mental health?
I'm planning on leaving this job for another soon. Boss doesn't know that, thinks everything is mostly fine, and I'll still be in the area when I switch so he'll likely realize he was part of the issue. He's not a bad guy, just a bad boss and not someone I would ever choose to spend any time with.

What I worry about is that he's already experiencing some mental health issues in his position alone (he's relatively new to the position, got promoted after 15 years when his boss left and I came in to his old position a year later). He stresses constantly and doesn't seem to like much about the job in the first place. Now a coworker that we both work closely with is leaving, which will increase our burdens significantly. I want to leave as soon as possible and - based on interest I've gained so far - won't be leaving too long after this coworker.

I worry that he will have some sort of mental collapse. The question is not whether or not I leave; I can't make my life choices based on potential outcomes out of my control. The question is: is there anything I can do to ease me leaving, to lessen the shock once I tell him and the burden once I'm gone?
