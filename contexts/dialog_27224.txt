MERYL: So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
TRUMAN: I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
MERYL: So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea? I'd better call your mother when we get there. She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this.
TRUMAN: Now what?
OFFICER: Leak at the plant. They had to shut her down.
TRUMAN: Is there any way around?
OFFICER: The whole area's being evacuated.
TRUMAN: Well, thank you for your help.
OFFICER: You're welcome, Truman.
