SOMERSET: Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month. He says, quote, I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one
MILLS: A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
SOMERSET: Who pays the rent on time.
MILLS: I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
SOMERSET: This is the job. It's not an Easter egg hunt.
MILLS: There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow. I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
SOMERSET: It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
MILLS: Oh, blah, blah, blah. The guy's insane.
SOMERSET: It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
MILLS: Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh? Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
SOMERSET: No.
MILLS: Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
SOMERSET: No. He's not depending on luck. You've seen that. We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day. To the day! Because he wanted us to.
MILLS: We don't know for sure...
SOMERSET: Yes we do. Here...
SOMERSET: This quote... his first words to us. I looked it up. It's from Milton's Paradise Lost. Long is the way
MILLS: And so what?
SOMERSET: Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
MILLS: Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
SOMERSET: Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic. The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year. To connect tubes to his genitals. To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints. He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
MILLS: What does all that matter anyway? It's not our job to figure him out, is it? All we have to do is catching him.
