PEARL: ... see there ain't just two parts to a person. There's three. Body-Soul and Spirit. The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on. Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
PATRICK: But the place burned to the ground.
PEARL: The blood is still there. We just gotta figure out where.
CINNABAR: In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something. Covered with blood.
PEARL: My God. My dress. We have to find it. And burn it. And shut the door.
BONES: I don't understand it. You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas. I always looked after you. You had a piece of everything I had.
JEREMIAH: I didn't want a piece of yours, I wanted my own.
BONES: And the hell everybody else, right?
JEREMIAH: Wait, Jimmy. Think about it. You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
BONES: No brother. I wouldn'ta. I never done a man - any man. Let alone a brother like that. Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked. Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad? You about to find out.
