Regretting taking part-time summer job?
I am currently 18 and just finished my freshman year of college. I had accepted a part-time position as an grocery online order shopper at Giant Eagle and am kind of scared of the current situation. The problem is that this is my first job and I was hoping for experience to add to my empty resume. 

Is it worth the risks? Should I test the job out to see if it is safe enough? Maybe, Iâ€™m just nervous.

Any advice?

Thanks!
