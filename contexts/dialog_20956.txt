TAYLOR: She comes along too.
LUCIUS: Zira doesn't want your female.
TAYLOR: I want her.
LUCIUS: If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
TAYLOR: Fine. Just let her out.
ZIRA: I told you not to bring the other one.
LUCIUS: He wouldn't leave her.
ZIRA: All right... Get in...hurry. Put this on.
TAYLOR: Listen-
ZIRA: Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
LUCIUS: Gorilla hunters ...
ZIRA: Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
