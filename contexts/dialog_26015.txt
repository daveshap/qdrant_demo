MIKEY: When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank. What did you do in high school?
CONSUELO: I did not go to high school.
MIKEY: Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
CONSUELO: We had to work. My family was poor.
MIKEY: Must've been hard being poor.
CONSUELO: I'm still poor.
MIKEY: Hmmm. But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
CONSUELO: No, Mikey.
MIKEY: But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
CONSUELO: I'm always working.
MIKEY: But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
CONSUELO: This is work.
MIKEY: But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
