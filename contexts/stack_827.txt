The \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10\" option not available I am currently running Windows 10. I have 3 more local drive partitions namely D, E and F along with C drive and System Reserved G drive. I want to install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS in C drive (which also has Windows 10) which has around 75GB free space out of 150GB. My computer uses BIOS and not UEFI.I am not getting Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 10 option, so I saw some videos on Youtube and saw that they are shrinking the space of C drive. But I am only getting 4440 MB available to shrink but I have 75 GB free! I want to have at least 20-25 GB for Ubuntu.How can I increase the available shrink space of C drive?Also, can I install Ubuntu in F drive which is of 180GB size? I can move the files from F drive to any other drive for that matter. Will I still get the option to load either Windows 10 or Ubuntu in the boot menu?
