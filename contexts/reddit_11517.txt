I got mugged for the first time today.
I was walking to meet with my gf, then we would go to school. I was going to the bus stop, when a man pulled a knife on me and said "Give me your phone now", so i gave my phone to him without hesitating, then he asked for my wallet (It was in my backpack) and I proceeded to take it, he got impacient and told me to give my backpack to him (with all my notebooks inside). Afterwards he told me to keep walking in the direction I was going, I was in shock, so I kept going to the bus stop, cause I wanted to tell my gf what had just happened. She met me in the bus stop, I was shaking, serious and worried. She spent the day with me and it helped me a lot, but I can't help feeling powerless and humiliated.  I lost my phone and all my stuff, I am having flashbacks about it and I don't know what to do. (English is not my first language, so feel free to correct my grammar).

(Update)

My friends and family have been giving a lot of support, I wasn't expecting this at all. My best friend visited me and we played a bunch of games to make me feel better. My girlfriend has been talking to me all the time and suggested I should go to a psychologist and her mother bought me a new phone (I'll be leaving this one in my house for a while). My aunt was desperate when she found out, she cried a lot and called me to ask me if I was fine.
My physics teacher and my math teacher were very worried about me. My school principal gave me some notebooks so I could easily come back to school. I think I am better now, I'm still afraid of walking in my neighborhood, specially near  the intersection where it happened. And finally, reading all the comments also helped me a lot, so thanks everyone, I think it's all coming together now (no meme intended).
