How to use /setblock to place a chain_command_block with arguments Normally, I just troubleshoot and look for solutions online, so I apologize if this has already been answered. However, I am getting confused on how to use the command /setblock to place a chain command block with the state of it being conditional, facing south, and with an argument. I tried this code:<blockquote>  /setblock x y z minecraft:chain_command_block conditional=true facing=south {Command:\"say south\"}</blockquote>The problem is that it doesn't face south, it faces north, as if it is ignoring the \"facing\" argument. I also tried:<blockquote>  /setblock x y z minecraft:chain_command_block facing=south conditional=true {Command:\"say south\"}</blockquote>This gives me an error, which I assume is because there is a specific order that I am violating. Am I doing this totally wrong? Could someone at least direct me to a response if it has already been given? I have searched and couldn't find anything.
