How do you keep notes with your advisor?
How do you keep notes of the meetings and the things to do with your advisor on research and them she/he updated on it as well in a collaborative way? Iâ€™ve been thinking of having a shared google doc so that we both can add notes to it during meetings. But we have couple of other documents. The method is somewhat good but open for suggestions.
