SLOVO: I'll leave you two alone to talk.
XANDER: Yeah, thanks a lot.
SHAVERS: Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
XANDER: I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
SHAVERS: Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
XANDER: Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
SHAVERS: Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
