My last day.
Today is my last day. I cant deal with my mental health any longer. Its been 27 years of pure hell. I have only been fighting so others wouldnt be uncomfortable if i killed myself. I wont do it any more. I have great things going for me on the outside but inside me it is my own personal hell. I have done everything to try to overcome this and nothing works. For several reasons. I am terrified to die but it has to be better than the hell i live every second of my life.
