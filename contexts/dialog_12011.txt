FATHER: Why should I be afraid?
MICKEY: Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
FATHER: So?
MICKEY: That thought doesn't terrify you?
FATHER: Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive. When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
MICKEY: I don't understand. Aren't you frightened?
FATHER: Of what? I'll be unconscious.
MICKEY: Yeah, I know. But never to exist again!
FATHER: How do you know?
MICKEY: Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
