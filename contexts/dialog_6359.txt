LIZA: I don't see the connection.
JERRY: Come on! Six major earthquakes in the last three years? The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
LIZA: Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
JERRY: Not testing. <u>Using</u>. Nukes are passe. This is the weapon of the future.
LIZA: I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
JERRY: Do you still ride?
LIZA: Not for years.
JERRY: So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
LIZA: Well, I -- Jerry, the point. Get there. What does it have to do with the President?
JERRY: The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line. They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
LIZA: Motive?
JERRY: He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry. We're talking billions. Motive enough?
LIZA: <u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
JERRY: Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
JERRY: You going to warn him?
LIZA: I can't promise you anything.
JERRY: You think I'm crazy.
LIZA: I think you're different.
JERRY: You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>. I can't lie to me, Liza. And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on? You want to go out sometime?
LIZA: No.
JERRY: I better get going.
LIZA: You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry. Just call and make an appointment.
JERRY: What was your horse's name?
LIZA: Johnny Dancer. You've been in my office ten times. How come you never asked me about that picture before?
JERRY: Was waiting till I knew you better. Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
