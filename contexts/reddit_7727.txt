Listing published conference abstracts on CV/Researchgate?
I presented at a conference in May and the abstracts for the conference were recently published as part of a special issue of the society's journal. How/where should I report this on my CV? I've already listed the presentation in my "Presentations" section. What about on Researchgate?

For context, I'm an ecologist. This is my first conference proceedings type of thing so not sure how to handle it. Any advice would be much appreciated!
