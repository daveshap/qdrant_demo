Are Donald Trump's continued ties with business and apparent conflicts of interest unprecedented?
I have seen a lot of criticism of Donald Trump over his continued involvement in business. He is not removing himself from Trump Organization as much as many would like, and he also says he will keep his role as executive producer of celebrity apprentice. Many say this creates a conflict of interest. I'm inclined to agree, but it also raises another question. Is Donald Trump uniquely conflicted in this area, or have any past presidents also kept similar ties with businesses while president or had similar conflicts of interest?
