BILLINGS: You got me beat on both accounts.
MARION: The hell I do.
MARION: Gabriel? Are you asleep?
GABRIEL: We're low on salt. I should go to Pembroke and get some.
BILLINGS: You got salt last week.
GABRIEL: Oh, right. Baking powder, we need baking powder.
BILLINGS: We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.
