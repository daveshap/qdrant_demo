EDDIE: I don't know. I felt like it. I never saw anyone get done before.
WELLES: You enjoy it?
EDDIE: Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that. It was just something I was doing for money.
WELLES: Tell me what happened.
EDDIE: What do you want to know? You saw it, you saw the loop...
WELLES: Nobody saw you bring her in?
EDDIE: There wasn't nobody around. This place was a shit-hole. I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries. Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
WELLES: What did you do with her body?
EDDIE: Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
WELLES: Show me.
