TAUPIN: My condolences.
MORAN: Where were you Tuesday night?
TAUPIN: Home.
MORAN: A neighbor saw your car leave.
TAUPIN: He's mistaken.
MORAN: Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
TAUPIN: Do you?
MORAN: All I need is time.
TAUPIN: I've got all the time in the world. Except right now. If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
BRENNA: Someone beat you.
TAUPIN: Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
BRENNA: Grave robbers?
TAUPIN: Probably.
BRENNA: Who?
TAUPIN: People like that rarely leave business cards.
BRENNA: Does Carl Smith?
TAUPIN: I don't know what you're talking about.
BRENNA: I think you do. Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
TAUPIN: You have an active imagination.
BRENNA: I've been to Church Hill.
TAUPIN: Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you. I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.
