I want to die
I want to die.
I want to stop thinking.
I want to stop hurting.
I want to die.

I just had to tell someone. Anyone. Because I can’t tell anyone else.


Edit: I didn’t expect this post to be so huge but appreciate everyone’s response, help and stories. I kinda made it through the night and talked to my therapist. The thoughts are still there loudly as ever but I don’t think i will commit suicide within the next days. Thank you everyone for reaching out to me. I hope you guys find hope and something to make your day better. Really. Thank you a lot. Reading all the comments and talking to some of you people helped me immense in distracting myself. I wish you the best. (I’m still here for anyone who wants to talk and wants to suffer together tho) please continue to help others in need
