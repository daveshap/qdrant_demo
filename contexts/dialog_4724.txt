PRINCESS: Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
WALLACE: A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
PRINCESS: Peace is made is such ways.
WALLACE: SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
PRINCESS: I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
WALLACE: She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
