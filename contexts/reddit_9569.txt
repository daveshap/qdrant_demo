You're welcome [RANT]
Happy awards season everyone. Fuck this time of year.

So here's a shout out to everyone who busts their ass day after day without so much as a thank you. High five to everyone who gives, gives,  gives and rarely takes.  Much love to the people who question the status quo and piss off the "company men." A big hug to everyone who deserves that award or recognition more than the same suckups who win them every year. And the biggest "YOU'RE FUCKING WELCOME" to the lazy bastards who give just enough effort to not get fired, from those of us who carry the weight and give a shit about what we do.
