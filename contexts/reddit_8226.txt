What was the legal authority for the US attack on Syria?
Tonight the US military [fired missiles at a Syrian air base](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/us-said-to-weigh-military-responses-to-syrian-chemical-attack.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) in response to a [gas attack several days ago.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/middleeast/syria-gas-attack.html)

What legal authority, if any, existed for this strike, both within US law an international law?  [In his statement](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/trump-syria-statement-transcript-236976) Trump referenced the Chemical Weapons Convention and the "urging" of the UN security council.  Do either of these play into the legal analysis?
