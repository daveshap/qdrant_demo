ALTHEA: -- The argument had nothing to do with it.
MUMFORD: I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
ALTHEA: I had ordered some books. The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written.""
MUMFORD: Uh-huh. What are they?
ALTHEA: Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
MUMFORD: One hundred books?
ALTHEA: It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
MUMFORD: What happened?
ALTHEA: We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
MUMFORD: You must have been concerned.
ALTHEA: It's happened before. I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it. I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
MUMFORD: Doubtful. What did he say?
ALTHEA: He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer. He liked to acquire things."
