GRADY: You stay there.
CRABTREE: What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
CRABTREE: Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
GRADY: Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
CRABTREE: Sometimes we have to improvise.
GRADY: Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
CRABTREE: James? My James? What's happened?
GRADY: Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
CRABTREE: Kidnapped? By who?
GRADY: His parents.
CRABTREE: Good God. Let's go rescue him.
GRADY: Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
CRABTREE: Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
GRADY: It's a little late to call Admissions.
CRABTREE: Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
GRADY: Maybe... I don't know.
