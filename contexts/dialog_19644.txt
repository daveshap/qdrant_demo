RAKONIN: Your Highness.
SWANA: How do you do, my friend.
RAKONIN: Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
SWANA: What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
RAKONIN: No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
SWANA: My jewels?!
RAKONIN: I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
SWANA: Why do you bring this up after so many years?
RAKONIN: They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
SWANA: Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
RAKONIN: This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your Highness, they are going to sell them!
LEON: Did I hear something about jewels?
SWANA: Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
