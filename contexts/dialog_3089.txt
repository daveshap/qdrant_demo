BRUCE: That kid is amazing.
CHASE: I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
BRUCE: Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
CHASE: The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
BRUCE: Don't believe it. I'm just skin deep.
BRUCE: Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
CHASE: Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
BRUCE: But...
CHASE: Well, I met someone...
BRUCE: Fast work. You just moved here.
CHASE: You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
BRUCE: He sure did.
CHASE: What?
BRUCE: I said I'm sure he did.
