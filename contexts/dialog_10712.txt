REBECCA: Funky"?"
ENID: What, is she black now?
REBECCA: I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
ENID: What are you talking about?
REBECCA: That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
ENID: You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
REBECCA: Just promise you'll do it.
ENID: Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
DAD: Have you seen my blue spatula?
ENID: Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
DAD: Not if I don't find that goddamn spatula.
