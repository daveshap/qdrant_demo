BUTTERFIELD: Like the look of these? I made them myself, to set him free.
DOROTHEA: Why did you wait so long?
BUTTERFIELD: I didn't have the skill to resurrect him. I had to teach myself. And that took time.

BUTTERFIELD: If he was just a man like me, then no. But he's not.
DOROTHEA: What is he?
BUTTERFIELD: Maybe he'll show you.
