PAUL: Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
PAUL: The spice! It's in everything here. The air, the soil, the food... It's like the Truthsayer drug..... It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me. But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness. I can see it... I can see it.
JESSICA: Is he....?
PAUL: You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
JESSICA: He knows.
PAUL: You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach... I'm something different, something unexpected! I'm a seed. I am so much more... You don't begin to know me...
