BUFF: Hey, man.
TIM: Hey.
JEFF: They let you out?
TIM: Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
JEFF: You lied to me.
TIM: You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
JEFF: No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
TIM: Wow. You did that for me?
JEFF: Yes.
TIM: Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
JEFF: Why? Because I give a shit?
TIM: Oh, shit.
JEFF: Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
TIM: Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
JEFF: Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
TIM: I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
JEFF: You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
TIM: Good, good. I, I hope he does.
JEFF: The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
TIM: Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
JEFF: I don't know.
TIM: You don't know?
JEFF: No.
TIM: Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
JEFF: No.
TIM: No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
JEFF: What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
TIM: Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
JEFF: Just go home, alright?
TIM: This is my home.
JEFF: Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
TIM: They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
JEFF: They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
TIM: What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
JEFF: Will you just put the gun down?
TIM: No.
JEFF: Just put it down.
