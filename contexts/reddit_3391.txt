I’m surprised at how normal it seems to be to expect sex relatively fast
The other day I read a comment from a guy saying that if a girl hasn’t had sex with him by date 5, he assumes that she’s either not interested in him or not interested in sex in general and moves on. This seemed like quite a leap to me, but I marked it as an outlier and moved on. 

Today, there was a whole thread about it where many people agreed that it was a huge problem to not have sex/sexual contact by the 5th date. Is this view really that common? 

I’m someone who usually likes there to be a good emotional connection/building of trust first, and to me it seems a little wild that this is supposed to happen by the 5th date. If the dates started with the person as a total stranger,  I feel like you’re still just at the tip of the iceberg with getting to know them by 5 dates. 

I don’t know, I was just shocked by this consensus, and it seems like a wild leap to say that someone’s either asexual or not interested if there’s not sex by 5 dates. I will also say that as a woman, many guys will see you as “easy” for putting out too soon in their eyes, so it seems like a damned if you do, damned if you don’t kind of situation.

Edit: after reading the replies it seems like as a woman, it can be easy to feel like a guy’s just in it for the sex/not in it very seriously if he pushes for it too much/too fast, but as a guy, it can be easy to feel like the girl is not interested/not in it very seriously if the girl’s not having sex after a bit. What a mess
