ROSTAGNO: Hola, bienvenido
GENNARO: What's this I hear at the airport≈† Hammond's not even here?
ROSTAGNO: He sends his apologies.
GENNARO: You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
ROSTAGNO: He had to leave early to be with his daughter. She's getting a divorce.
GENNARO: I understand that. I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now. The insurance company - -
ROSTAGNO: Hammond hates inspections. They slow everything down.
GENNARO: Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down. If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
