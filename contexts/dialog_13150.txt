MAURA: To our family.
WILL: To our family.
MAURA: I wish I knew more about her.
WILL: Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
MAURA: Not really. She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland. I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
WILL: Or what she was worth.
WILL: God rest her soul.
MAURA: I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment. She didn't even know who I was. It's just... tradition.
