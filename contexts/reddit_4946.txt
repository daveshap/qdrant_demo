Does anyone else hate themselves for not being happy?
I haven’t gone to a doctor, so I’m not entirely sure I am depressed. I haven’t been happy for a long time, and I get mad at myself for simply not being happy. I hate myself so much, especially for being depressed, but I don’t know why. I have no idea why I’m like this, but I hate myself so much. Idk what to do with this. I’m really hoping one of you knows what I mean.

EDIT: it’s like I hate myself for hating myself. I’m not sure if it’s because I feel weak or what.
