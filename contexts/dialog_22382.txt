SAM: He's going back.
VINCENT: Not necessarily. He could go off road at any number of places. He might not even be in the country anymore.
SAM: It's Paris. The route's too indirect for anything else. A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now. He's going to Paris. Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
