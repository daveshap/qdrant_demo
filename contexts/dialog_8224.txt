BRILL: Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
SENATOR ALBERT: Well then who can?
BRILL: Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
SENATOR ALBERT: What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
BRILL: The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
SENATOR ALBERT: What are you saying?
BRILL: Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
SENATOR ALBERT: Law enforcement?
BRILL: FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
SENATOR ALBERT: Are you sure about this?
BRILL: I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
SENATOR ALBERT: Oh my God.
BRILL: Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
SENATOR ALBERT: With what?
BRILL: With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
SENATOR ALBERT: Neil, thank you for your help.
BRILL: Anytime.
