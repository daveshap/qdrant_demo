Family Sharing iPhone - Unique Question about purchases I want to know if someone in my family share group still has an app downloaded on their phone. Is there a way to tell if they have deleted the app from their device?  I know all about hiding apps and how they cannot be deleted and all that. I get all that.  For example, I know about an app I told my kid he cannot use.  Well, its always going to show up on his downloaded list - but is there a way to see if he has put it back on his phone or not via family sharing.   (kid has adult privileges in family sharing, he is a teenager and I don't use any of the other parental controls nor do I want to)
