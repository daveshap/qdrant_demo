How to interact with my uneducated relatives if my view of life after studying in the USA has completely changed and totally differs from them.
I grew up in a second world country which is now basically a third world one, people are mostly doing bad, poor,  uneducated, very conservative. Country is religiously diverse, however my ethnicity and relatives(around 500 people) are muslims and extremely conservative and soviet type of thinking(don’t excel, don’t study, don’t think differently, etc.) 
Now, I was always a boy, who was sensitive, weak but enjoying the books. My father managed to send me to the USA at the age of 15 to come back with a bachelor’s in robotics. This is sort of background. I totally differ from teenagers in my homecountry and think differently than most of the people home in terms of dietary guidelines, political views, tolerance opinions and religious points. I do not think that women are worse than men. I do not think that LGBT community needs to be tortured and slaughtered. I do not think that animals are treated the way they should(i am a vegan). I have long hair and like to tie it in a bun. I do not like to fight with other males my age for the status of dominance or any other reasons, however I am not physically weak anymore. Etc., etc. 
Now, the question is how to convince myself that I am no better in any way than them and interact with them as if i consider them equal to me intellectually? I know I might sound arrogant and i want to know what to do about. How to properly talk with my people in order to not get my ass kicked?
What to not say?
Should I mention that I have learnt a new language( I will be in Costa Rica so they are going to be hear about it).
Thanks for attention!!!
