How concerning should Trudeau's proposed $29.4 billion deficit be?
PM Trudeau [put out his first budget today](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-budget-2016-main-1.3501802) and it calls for a number of new spending measures, with an estimated deficit of $29.4 billion.  That's about [1.47% of Canada's $1.997 trillion GDP.](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/gdps02a-eng.htm)

This is substantially higher than the [$10 billion or less that Trudeau promised when he was campaigning.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-liberals-infrastructure-deficits-1.3205535)  Is this cause for concern, and could Canada be looking at a return to the [bad old days of the mid 1990s debt crisis?](http://business.financialpost.com/uncategorized/lessons-from-canadas-basket-case-moment)  Or is this a manageable deficit that won't have strong negative future impacts?

*edit:*  I made a stupid error, Canada's GDP is 1.997 *trillion* not billion.

Also, all dollars Canadian.
