STARKS: I'm not sure.
WAITRESS: You don't have anywhere to stay?
STARKS: I don't think so.
WAITRESS: Well, where are you from?
STARKS: I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
WAITRESS: Of course you don't know.
STARKS: Why of course"?"
WAITRESS: Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
STARKS: Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
