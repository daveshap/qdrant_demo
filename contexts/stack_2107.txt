Not a decade, but a term for a 9 year span Thanks for the help in advance; first time posting here.I'm curious what the most appropriate single word is to describe a 9 year time span, or a 9 year anniversary. A search on Google didn't turn up much, but it did help me find this information in the Wiki page for \"decade\": \"...Other words for spans of years also come from Latin: biennium (2 years), triennium (3 years), quadrennium (4 years), lustrum (5 years)\".Following this pattern, the most appropriate form of the word I could come up with is novemnium, seeing as novem is Latin for 9. Is this the correct structure/spelling, or are there better alternatives to this problem?
