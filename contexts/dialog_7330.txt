NICK: It's Merle, Sal.
SAL: Merle? ... Merle's alive? How do you know?
NICK: I saw him last night. I thought I was dreaming. I thought I was out of my mind.
SAL: Merle gave me this?
NICK: Yeah.
SAL: But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
NICK: Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in. We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
SAL: Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
NICK: It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
SAL: Phantom Mary?
NICK: Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
SAL: No.
NICK: Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
SAL: Yeah!
NICK: Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...
NICK: Biederman! Where's Biederman!
LIEUTENANT: Here.
NICK: You Biederman?
LIEUTENANT: Biederman, yes.
NICK: I got you on this flight, Biederman. Is that right?
