VADA: There's still a big spot on the floor.
HARRY: Okay, we need wallpaper paste. Hey Cece!
VADA: Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
HARRY: Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
SHELLY: Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
VADA: Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
HARRY: She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
VADA: Was it a nice funeral?
HARRY: Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
