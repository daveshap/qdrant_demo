Word/phrase to describe the kind of joy that you feel when someone you like or love shows you an act of kindness or love In my country, we call it \u201ckilig.\u201d When a guy, for instance, unexpectedly smiles at a girl who happens to have feelings for him, chances are the girl will feel so jubilant she would scream inside and smile. Joyous, jubilant, and happy are too general to describe that specific feeling (you feel toward a person you like) that I want to describe using a \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d word or phrase. Can you suggest some terms?
