SERAFINE: Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
ANDY: So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
ANDY: Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
SERAFINE: So's Woody Allen. No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes. You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
ANDY: That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard. Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
SERAFINE: A la votre.
ANDY: This looks familiar...
SERAFINE: Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc- I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
