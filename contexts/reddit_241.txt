how can you tell if someone likes you
i have a really close friend that always joked about me and him dating and i would joke back and he told me many things like we’re going to be married and have kids and we’re going to end up together whether i think so or not and i always found it as like a joke but then he started talking to another girl and i realized how jealous i got because 1. she hates me and uses everything in her power to prevent him from seeing me and 2. i really did like him a lot and he was my closest friend and seeing him get dragged down by her is sad but i am confused very very confused about him because even though he’s with her he hangs out with me in secret and still talks like we’re going to be married and hookup and i’m like bud, you can’t be saying these things because your gf is NOT gonna be happy but he keeps doing it and i like it but i have to act like it’s bad because i don’t condone cheating and then i’m really trying to move on like it’s horribly painful being attached to him so i’m trying so hard to move on so i start talking to other guys and i’m talking to another guy(P) who is quite popular and we’ve been getting closer and closer and one day my old friend sees me and P and he pops up out of literally no where and says “where are y’all going” and P said “to have sex” because that is top tier comedy to teenage boys and my old friend, i’m gonna call him C, so he goes “oh ha ha yea ha ha” real awkwardly and i was like okkkkkkk P let’s go and we go to walk away and C goes woahhhhh bro i didn’t know you wore a chain and keeps talking to P cuz they’re like acquainted and we try to walk away again and he keeps pointing out random things like shoes and hoodies and just keeps talking so i’m like listen C we gotta go and we finally walk away and sit at a lunch table and C comes up again and starts talking to me who he “isn’t allowed to be seen with at school” and i’m like listen bud you’re gonna get in trouble with your girl and that’s that, well about a week later P goes silent like he ignores me won’t talk to me and it hurt and i thought i did something wrong but i find out from C’s friend that him and P hung out on the weekend and now P is just dead silent and i highly assume C talked trash about me so P would drop me and it’s so fucking annoying because i just want to move on, so again i start talking to another guy who is kinda friends with C, we are becoming friends it’s all good then C sees us together and bam this guy stops talking to me too and i’m just confused and thinking C is a jealous little bitch who can’t let me go but won’t be with me and then C’s best friend says i’m going to marry C and his gf (who i have class with) is threatened to hell by me because C “tells her things” and she “knows whats going on” which i got no idea what this girl means but i just need to get some backup that other people think he likes me too so i can confront him and not be absolutely and completely off the mark looking like a clown
