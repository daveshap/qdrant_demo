5 Most Overdone Essays and How to Avoid Them
Hey everyone,

Based on your feedback, it seems like a lot of you are curious about what the most common essay structures are and what are topics to generally avoid for top schools. You know, I’ve always found it fascinating how rapidly the admissions process changes every year, and how behind the general public is at catching up. The essay advice I see online now is about 5-6 years late. It’s 2019, nobody’s writing about dead pets or mission trips to Africa anymore. 

The following represents some of the essays that I have found to be the most overdone ranked from most common to least. One disclaimer I want to make is that essays, while vital, are not the only factor for a student's success. There are also ways to make these work, though I generally tell students not to try since they’re more difficult targets to hit. Lastly, these reflect my own experience, and I’ll bet that another reader in another office might have a different set of essays he/she/they are tired of reading.




**The Most Common Essay Structure, Period**

This essay outline has become the most popular over the past 3-4 years or so. I’m not sure why, but it goes something like this:

1. First standalone sentence that’s supposed to “grab the reader’s attention” I guess. *The electricity in the room was palpable.* 

2. Following that, the first narrative paragraph explaining/revealing the context and situation. *Got it, so you’re at your state debate tournament.*

3. Montage paragraph describing your journey from the beginning to this moment. *You joined your debate team and were elected team captain.*

4. Jumping to the present and wrapping up your story. *Hurray, you won an award and/or placed well.*

5. End with a personal takeaway that doesn’t look any different than the last hundred essays I’ve read about your sport/club/instrument. *You weren’t confident in yourself initially, but now you learned to accept yourself and are thriving as a result. You were scared to be in a new environment, but now you feel comfortable and have assimilated into a new team.*

Now fundamentally this structure makes sense and performed well years ago. It builds suspense, it weaves in and out of time like an action movie. The problem I find is that many of these essays 1) follow this structure exactly with no variation and 2) have nothing of substance to say. It gets tiring. Instead of having exactly this outline, I would recommend that students try to build upon this or use this as a launch pad. 




**First-World “Woe-is-Me” Essays**

Nobody’s writing about dead pets anymore, but the general idea is still showing up. Many middle-class to upper-class students make the focal point of their Common Application about issues they face that a reader is just not going to care about. The larger problem is that students will write about these mundane problems with complete and utter sincerity. Examples include minor maladies or ailments, “financial issues,” difficult teachers etc.

There are two problems with this approach: 

1) You’re operating under the assumption that gaining sympathy from your readers will help you gain an acceptance. This is not going to be true when you are in these social classes. Exceptions do exist, but only for applicants with extreme familial and financial situations. Most of you writing these essays do not originate from such a background.

2) We’re not stupid. Students will often write about financial inconveniences or having a lack of educational resources even though they grew up in a nice, upper-middle class suburb with a solid school system. We can generally tell what your income is based on your activities and we know your region from previous cycles. At best, your reader is confused about your story and background. At worst, they think you’re exaggerating your circumstances.

Generally, writing about difficulties you’ve faced is completely doable as long as you have something interesting to say and can relate to your reader. I just don’t want to read 650 words about how hard it was growing up with braces, especially when millions of children across the globe don’t have access to dental care.




**“Quirky” Essays with No Substance**

I blame all those wacky viral essays on Business Insider (the most useless site ever) or whatever.  

If you ask anyone in this subreddit, everyone “knows” that it is important to be unique and differentiate yourself. What makes you special, what can you bring to campus etc. The problem is that many of these essays tend to focus more on “Hey look at me, I’m different!” rather than having something substantive to say.

The core issue is that students tend to come across as inauthentic. Being genuine and sincere in your essays is one of (if not the most) important things colleges look for, and writing about oatmeal or staplers or some other random object really makes me question whether I like you or not. 

So that’s the logical reason. From my experience, sometimes admissions officers just won’t like you because you come across as plain weird. You might think your Hearthstone Twitch channel or yo-yo skills are cool, but a lot of readers just won’t care.




**Tragedy**

Unfortunately, tragedy is very common. I’ve read hundreds of essays about friends’ suicides, parental deaths, abuse, bullying, assault etc. The issue from an admissions perspective is that 1) there are so many similar ones that it’s difficult to differentiate you from others in the pool 2) generally, you spend the entire essay talking about other people rather than yourself 3) students often have nothing new or innovative to say about said tragedy. I know this is unfortunate, but this is just the nature of seeing these essays year after year for a long period of time. People don’t care about sob stories anymore on American Idol either. 

Personally, I think that tragedy, if included, should not be the focal point of your essay. Weave it into a larger structure, and make it more about yourself and how the circumstances you faced have changed your perspective. Plenty of students nail this part and perform very well in the overall process as a result. 




**Food/Recipe essays**

There’s two common food essays I’ll see:

1) Metaphor using a particular recipe (lasagna, dumplings etc.) to highlight an applicant’s different qualities through layers or steps. This one’s more common, and just lazy at this point. 

2) Recipe or special food that has been passed down in the applicant’s family (usually grandparents) through cooking together

This surprised me when I first started reading applications, but it makes sense—regardless of culture or class, everyone loves food. 



Lastly, a lot of you have asked me about the Costco essay that “got” a student into 5 Ivies. Look, if you are not also a Hispanic + African-American applicant like her, then I would not consider the essays or resumes of those who are as an appropriate resource. Use previous applicants to your advantage only when they match your own profile. Personally, I thought the essay was a fun read, somewhat refreshing albeit a little insincere and flowery, and would not consider it in the top tier of essays I’ve read. 



Anyways, hope this was helpful. I really liked a few of the other suggestions (what exactly does “fit” mean at an elite school AO, common myths etc.) and really wish I could include everything. More coming in the future!
