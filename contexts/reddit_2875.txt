WOC: How do you get people to respect you in the workplace?
I'm a young WOC who just joined the workforce a few years ago. Due to my background and personality, I tend to be a bit more quiet, and my approach is not as warm. I'm good at connecting with people 1-on-1, and I'm good at making small talks, because I'm a genuinely curious person. I think I have a sharp mind and I'm quite opinionated, but I don't necessarily try to prove that. In group settings, I tend to be an active listener and ask questions, instead of voicing my opinions and draw attention toward myself. I basically just hang back and gather information before making comments. I'm learning that this is a big disadvantage, as my colleagues and even acquaintances tend to cut me off or not acknowledge my input. I don't make as big of an impression in groups, and people tend to dismiss or forget about me, which has hindered my professional and personal life. What do you suggest I do to get people to respect me?
