GUMP: Whatever for?
JACK: Jenny Greenteeth said: Follow the raven in her flight...""
GUMP: Aye. Said to follow it to the edge of night. But is this the right bird?

GUMP: Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
JACK: Beware.
GUMP: Sounds like the bird we want. All right lads, follow yon raven!
