Advice for preparations for a lockdown?
The country I'm currently in has yet to do a lockdown, but we're expecting the government (or at least the university) to issue some form of restrictions. For those who are already on lockdown, any advice on what should I, as a PhD student, and we, as a lab, do in preparation for a lockdown? What are the things that I should do in order to stay (somewhat) productive?

Currently, our biggest concern is our mutant mice colonies, and we have been advised to stock up. What did you do in your labs?
