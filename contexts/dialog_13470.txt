BEN: It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
JANEY: Ben--
BEN: Yeah?
JANEY: You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
BEN: You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
JANEY: You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
BEN: Gotcha.
WENDY: Hi mom.
ELENA: Hi Wendy.
ELENA: I saw you on your bike today.
WENDY: With Mikey?
ELENA: Who?
WENDY: Nobody.
ELENA: Mikey Williams?
WENDY: We were just riding around.
