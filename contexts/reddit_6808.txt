How to turn down an agent without ghosting and how to explain vacation next March?
I have an agent who called me on Monday to introduce some positions. One of them requires 2+ years of retail operations experience in a supermarket, which I don't have so I declined it since my only experience is working as a cashier at Target for two years. 

The other position is similar, working as an assistant manager in a bookstore, but also requires 1+ year of similar experience in a bookstore. 

I already responded to an e-mail she sent in which she included the job descriptions for both positions and I turned her down due to lack of experience. However, she insisted that I at least try and submit my resume for both positions. 

In addition, I have already planned a vacation of 2 weeks to a month next March. Do you think that would be detrimental to getting these positions in the first place? The onboarding process should take about 3 months for both positions if that makes a difference. Would it be a good idea to just say I'm not looking for a new job for right now since I am planning on a vacation in the near future? 

The agent has been calling me for the past two days as well, but I haven't had a chance to answer since I've been working pretty long shifts both Monday and Tuesday. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or advice!!
