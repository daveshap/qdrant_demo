KULOK: Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
MACKELWAY: No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
KULOK: I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
MACKELWAY: You did.
KULOK: Maybe we should back off a bit.
MACKELWAY: I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
KULOK: No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
MACKELWAY: Oh.
KULOK: There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
MACKELWAY: That's true.
KULOK: Then there's the other issue.
MACKELWAY: What's that?
KULOK: You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
MACKELWAY: I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
KULOK: And nobody else can do that?
MACKELWAY: Not the way I can.
KULOK: That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
MACKELWAY: Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
KULOK: I just need to go a little slow.
MURMAN: [Lionheart, what happened?]
MACKELWAY: Something came up, Murman, my man.
