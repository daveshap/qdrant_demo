Reason to believe layoffs are coming. I'm a recent hire and this is my first non-entry level job in the field.
The writing is on the wall and, even though I also have reason to believe the position (in general) is safe and I have been exceeding expectations, I would be a fool to not at least start thinking about the possibility. If I am laid off, I will probably have between 6 and 9 months of service.

I moved across the country (US) for this position, starting fresh with nothing after college. Basically I need advice on how to best leverage a short time at an impressive position in case I'm laid off.
