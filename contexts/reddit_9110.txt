Broke down crying cause I’m paying for the bus in 95% pennies
It’s so embarrassing and I just felt so much hatred and jealousy for people who don’t have to go through this. I’m struggling bad and I can’t afford anything. Job cut my hours extremely so I’m SOL. I’m emotionally tired


Edit:  wow omg first off thank you guys for the love and support. It means the world to me. I never expected this many people to be on my side. I just made a quick post with tears coming down my face, expecting nothing. Thank you I’m gonna cry but happy tears.
