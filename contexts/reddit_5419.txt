Where to start in underwriting
I’m a woman in my 30’s with a bachelors degree in agribusiness that I’ve never used, looking to change career paths (currently work in the veterinary industry) and have seen a lot of jobs posted for underwriting. From what I’ve gathered, this type of work would be right up my alley.
The problem is that all the job listings I have come across require previous underwriting experience—and there’s not really a certification program or class that gives you that equivalent experience.
So my question is, if anyone has any experience in this business, where did you start? And is it possible to jump in from a situation like mine?
