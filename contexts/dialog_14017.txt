JULIE: Ray, I can't...
RAY: Can't what?
JULIE: I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
RAY: I understand something.
JULIE: It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be. It just isn't.
