XANDER: I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
GIBBONS: If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
XANDER: Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
GIBBONS: One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
XANDER: I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
GIBBONS: We're not after car thieves here.
XANDER: What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
GIBBONS: That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
XANDER: Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
GIBBONS: My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
XANDER: I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
SAM TANNICK: Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
GIBBONS: I think we should send him whatever he wants.
SAM TANNICK: You what? A wire transfer of this size?
GIBBONS: If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
SAM TANNICK: You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
GIBBONS: He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play. I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
SAM TANNICK: Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
SAM TANNICK: Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
GIBBONS: So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
