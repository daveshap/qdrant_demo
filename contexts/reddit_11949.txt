College applications are creeping up on me.
I don't feel like I've accomplished as much as I thought I had. When it all goes down on paper, everything I've done looks like a lot less. To add to that, I only have a month until my most important application is due, and I still have multiple essays and a video to throw together for that. I really feel like there's no way I can do it. I feel helpless right now.
