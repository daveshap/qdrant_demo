Pre-College/College Access
Hey everyone! I am getting ready to start my degree in the fall for Student Affairs. I just had a summer job working for a pre college enrichment program that basically allows high school students a collegiate expereince on a college campus. This ranges from Prep courses, academy courses, and summer college courses (for credit). After expereincing this and seeing the range of possibilities I realize pre college/ college access programs are my primary areas that I would like to pursue, in addition to academic advising, admissions, and First-Year Expereince as alternative s. 

Within Pre-College/College Access, I know there is : TRiO, Education Opportunity Programs, college access non-profits, Summer Bridge programs, and seasonal Pre-College programs (summer programs/ dual enrollment). Within this, I would like to consider working with underrepresented student populations, including first gen students.

My questions are first if there is any scholarly literature from practitioners on these matters, second, are there people with expereinces in pre college programs for high school and /or middle school students, and lastly, what are some recommendations in terms of functional areas to get involved in since my campus does not have an area available like this?
