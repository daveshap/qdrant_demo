FRANCES: Oh! Are you really?
SYMINGTON: Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which...
FRANCES: Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
SYMINGTON: Please sit down...
FRANCES: You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
SYMINGTON: I see.
FRANCES: Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
SYMINGTON: And what's that?
FRANCES: Normal. Average.
SYMINGTON: All right. Will you please sit down now? Symington says.
FRANCES: ...Did you really say that?
SYMINGTON: Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
FRANCES: This whole thing is a joke!
SYMINGTON: Stay calm, please.
FRANCES: No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you? Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better... and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable... then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, Doctor?""
SYMINGTON: I'll have someone show you to your room.
FRANCES: Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
