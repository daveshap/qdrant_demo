FAUST: Yes? What is it?
ROBY: Jay, we've got a problem. I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
FAUST: Why, what's wrong?
ROBY: The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
FAUST: What do you mean?
ROBY: It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases. I'll just read it to you the way I got it: ... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... " And that's all it could translate."
STANDARD: Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
BROUSSARD: No, I want to go in.
