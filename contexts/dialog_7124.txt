REED: Clean.
BOB: What do you mean, he's clean?
REED: I mean I've checked everything. Women. Liquor... Finances. I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
BOB: No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
REED: The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob. He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
BOB: What about the wife?
REED: Clean.
BOB: Check his kids.
REED: Clean.
BOB: Nobody's got clean kids.
REED: We've got nothing, Bob. This won't work.
BOB: If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up. Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months. The whole thing is under control.
REED: You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
