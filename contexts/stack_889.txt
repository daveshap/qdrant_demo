Persistent xinput settings on 16.04 with Compiz I've tried several different methods to make a permanent change to my mouse button configuration to disable the wheel button (xinput set-button-map 10 1 0 3 from the command line - which works but doesn't last). However, whichever method I try (found many different by searching), it does not even survive locking the screen, let alone logging off and on again, suspending or rebooting.Does anyone have a definitive method that is proven to work?Thanks!
