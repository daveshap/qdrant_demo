CLAIRE: They called here after you left...
MIKE: She's okay. Everything's okay...
MIKE: I don't know you...
CLAIRE: This is me, Mike. There's nothing else...
MIKE: You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this? A fuckin' joke?
CLAIRE: Okay, then let's make it easy. It was a mistake. Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
