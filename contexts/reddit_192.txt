Hello, im 13 and i need advice because I see things others don’t and I don’t know how to tell my family
So lately I have been seeing black cloud my vision during class and it is really strange but that's not all of it. Randomly, sometimes during conversations, I get a strange feeling when I look at my hands and other people. They don't feel real. I don't know why. I'll even respond but it's not me speaking... Or it doesn't feel like me speaking. It's like someone is taking over my body. I sometimes see black when I'm moving quickly or when I focus on one thing. I don't know how to tell my parents and my counselors at school recommend I should get a doctor and that I should tell my parents but I don't know how.
 Edit: my mom came home and apparently my counselor told her about it so she booked a doctors appointment tomorrow and she is telling my dad, I'm scared *•* 
It’s been a year since this post and I have been diagnosed with severe depression just recently.
