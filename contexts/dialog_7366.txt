WILLY: Bye. Thanks.
WADE: Remember, get the seat fixed.
KIMBERLY: Michael called yesterday. He wants to take Willy for the summer.
CASSY: What did you say?
KIMBERLY: I'd think about it.
KIMBERLY: Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
CASSY: He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
KIMBERLY: I think he wants more than your cookies.
CASSY: Kimberly!
KIMBERLY: Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting. If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'. Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
