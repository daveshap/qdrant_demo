Got my annual performance review 6 months early
I only got hired into this position in April, and wasn't expecting a performance review until at least next April for that reason. However, in this role apparently the PA comes every October.

*And so does the annual raise.*

Guys. $0.54 an hour more, and my boss said I was doing "exceptionally well"!!! I'm in a two person department, and I currently don't have a coworker. Even so, he said all he's heard is good things!

I'm just excited, and wanted to share. Have a good day, fellow reddit(po)ors.
