RICK: I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
FERRARI: No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
RICK: I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
FERRARI: Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
FERRARI: The bourbon. The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
RICK: You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
FERRARI: Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
RICK: Practically no one.
FERRARI: If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
RICK: So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
FERRARI: I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
RICK: And the carrying charges?
FERRARI: Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
RICK: I'll tell him when he comes in.
FERRARI: Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
RICK: Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
RICK: That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
FERRARI: Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
