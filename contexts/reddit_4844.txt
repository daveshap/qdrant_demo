I’m so fucking lonely man i’m getting real bad real quick
I beg all my friends to do something every day but no one has time for me, i don’t even know what to say i have no hope left at all. All i want is to be able to have someone to at least try and be happy with, i’m really close to the edge here idk if i’m gonna start cutting or kill myself or what. I don’t even want anyone here to try and help because i know no one can help me with this i just need to express how i feel.

Edit: i appreciate the people trying to help me, but i really genuinely did not make this post looking for help, please stop trying to offer me advice. I realise i made it in the wrong sub, it is a post to tell myself how i feel, nothing anyone can say can help me. I am so deeply lonely and heartbroken by losing not only someone else, but also the progress i made with that person that i am really, really beyond help.
