what’s wrong with me? why can’t I move?
I haven’t been able to get out of bed, quite literally, in 2 months. Every passing day that I lay in this filth, it gets harder and harder to even want to move. I’ve given in to the belief that I am worthless and useless and incapable of progress. 

I have tried several times ti get out of bed and clean myself and clean my surroundings and respond to calls and messages. Every time I try to move it is like something heavy and dark is pulling me down. Some force greater than gravity. I can’t move. 

I feel absolutely disgusting and I smell horrible. You can imagine what you’d smell/feel/look like after 2 months of not cleaning yourself. I can taste blood in my mouth which I am assuming is my gums bleeding from not brushing my teeth. I know how awful this is. You don’t have to tell me. Even with all of this...I am still unbothered. I suddenly don’t care about myself at all and I am wondering what happened to me. 

I came home from a work trip 2 months ago, threw my suitcase on the floor in my room and just went to bed. Haven’t gotten up since. Never even unpacked. I have since lost my job because I just stopped showing up. 

Now I am living in a filthy room due to my neglect. There are dirty clothes all over the floor...I can’t even see the carpet anymore. Food...leftovers...wrappers...junk all over the place. Roaches I suspect due to the leftover food. I don’t care and that’s the worst part. 

I only eat one small meal a day. I don’t even need to step on a scale to see how much weight i’ve lost. I can feel my skeleton. 

I can’t cry even when I try to. I feel completely void of emotion. 

But I want to change. I want to move forward with my life but this weight I carry is so heavy...I am so overwhelmed with the amount of things I need to get done...thinking about all the effort and energy (I don’t have) that it’ll take....

I’m so tired. God...I am so damn tired. 
Please...someone help
