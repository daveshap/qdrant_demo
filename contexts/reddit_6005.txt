What should I put on my resume if I completed all the requirements for my degree but wont get it conferred until February?
I was told by an advisor that my college would automatically start the conferral process of my degree but just found out I have to submit a form for the process to begin. The earliest degree conferral date at this point is in February. What should I put on my resume between now and then as far as "education" goes?
