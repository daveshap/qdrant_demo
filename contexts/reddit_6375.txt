Having trouble finding a job? Teach English abroad!
I left a comment on here the other day about teaching English in Asia,  and got a ton of messages about it.   

Just wanted to let you know that if you're not able to find a job where you are,  teaching English abroad is a good opportunity to make an easy living,  and possibly pay off some debt. 

I'm currently living in Korea,  and there are plenty of jobs here.   You just need to be a native English speakers,  with a university degree,  physically healthy,  and able to commit to a year abroad.   

China and other countries have lower standards,  but you don't make as much.   

I'm happy to answer any questions you may have!
