NANCY: Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
ELAINE: Kristen specializes in strangeness. I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
NANCY: Did she always have nightmares?
ELAINE: They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
NANCY: I'm serious.
ELAINE: Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
NANCY: Just some answers. There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen. All good kids, smark kids.
ELAINE: I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me. If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
NANCY: I'm sure you would.
ELAINE: Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
NANCY: I'll need to take her things.
ELAINE: The maid packed a suitcase. Teresa! Teresa?
NANCY: I'll get it. Please, I don't mind.
ELAINE: First door up the stairs.
