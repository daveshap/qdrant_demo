BUD: Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
SHELDRAKE: You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
BUD: Yes, sir.
SHELDRAKE: I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
BUD: Naturally.
SHELDRAKE: Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
BUD: I see.
SHELDRAKE: The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
BUD: Don't mind what?
SHELDRAKE: You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
BUD: Very clever.
SHELDRAKE: Now I'll have to borrow your key.
BUD: Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
SHELDRAKE: What do you mean, sorry?
BUD: You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
SHELDRAKE: I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
BUD: Especially not Miss Kubelik.
SHELDRAKE: How's that again?
BUD: No key!
SHELDRAKE: Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
BUD: I dig.
SHELDRAKE: So what's it going to be?
SHELDRAKE: Now you're being bright?
BUD: Thank you, sir.
SHELDRAKE: Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
BUD: No I didn't.
SHELDRAKE: But this is the key to the executive washroom.
BUD: That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
SHELDRAKE: What's gotten into you, Baxter?
BUD: Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
SHELDRAKE: Now hold on, Baxter --
BUD: Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
DR. DREYFUSS: Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
BUD: Sure, Doc.
DR. DREYFUSS: How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
BUD: Well, I have things to do --
DR. DREYFUSS: What's this -- you packing?
BUD: Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
DR. DREYFUSS: Where are you moving to?
BUD: I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
DR. DREYFUSS: Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
BUD: Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
BUD: Can you use a bottle of champagne?
DR. DREYFUSS: Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
BUD: No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
DR. DREYFUSS: Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor. By the way, whatever happened to her?
BUD: You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
DR. DREYFUSS: Happy New Year.
SHELDRAKE: Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
FRAN: All set for what?
SHELDRAKE: I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
FRAN: Atlantic City?
SHELDRAKE: I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
FRAN: Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
SHELDRAKE: I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
FRAN: Baxter?
SHELDRAKE: He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
FRAN: He wouldn't.
SHELDRAKE: Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
FRAN: The nerve.
SHELDRAKE: That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
FRAN: I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
SHELDRAKE: What are you talking about?
FRAN: I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
