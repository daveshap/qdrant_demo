GRIERSON: David, David, David ...
DAVID: I'm fired? Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
GRIERSON: Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
