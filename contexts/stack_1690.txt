What determines the direction and cause of electric field exerted on test charges? -I understand when there is an on-going electric field, if it is produced by a positive charge, the direction of electric field is away from it etc. And, if we get a +ve test charge, it repels it, and the force is also the same direction as the field. However, I can't understand why and how we know the main electric field is + or - charged? What causes it? And, if electric field is produced by electric charge, how come the test charges don't change or affect the main field? (Sorry, if I make no sense!) For instance, what causes and determines the direction of electric field in a DC power line?
