How do I stop being jealous of my two good friends
Hi I am F(19) and have two awesome friends let’s call them Red and Yellow. They are smart, beautiful without trying and social people. Red and Yellow for lack of better terms are busty in the right places and Red is really athletic. They both have boyfriends and many people ready to chase them. They also both have tons of friends while I only have them really that I talk to.

I don’t have many friends, not as curvy, and during many social event I have noticed people frolicking to them admiring their beauty and makeup and I usually just get a hi op.

I have never had a bf and constantly feel like a third wheel and insecure about myself when in social situations but when I am just with them I feel very loved.

I really hope to get rid of this jealousy cause I know i is not a good attribute to have. How can I do that in a way where no one gets hurt?
