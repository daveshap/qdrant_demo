SHERIFF: Nice night for a drive. Morning really. I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
JOHN: Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
SHERIFF: Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra. What with that ruckus you had with Toby. Oh yes, I heard all about that.
JOHN: Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice. If I hadn't defended myself- -
SHERIFF: Just cool down, son. I ain't accusing you of anything. Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
JOHN: Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
SHERIFF: Nope. No problems up the road.
SHERIFF: That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
GRACE: Yes. Yes it is.
SHERIFF: Taking a little trip?
GRACE: I had a fight with Jake. I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose. I'm going to take a bus to my sister's. I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
SHERIFF: Is that right? Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit. I know I've had my fill of this town. Sixteen years I've been the law and order here. So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place. Help people, I guess. Keep the peace. Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me. Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them. Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal. I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna? A murder?
GRACE: I . . .
SHERIFF: Why don't you step out of the car, son?
JOHN: I don't understand what the--
SHERIFF: Just step from the car. Nice and slow.
JOHN: Sure, Sheriff.
SHERIFF: Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
JOHN: What for?
SHERIFF: I think you might just want to do as I say.
JOHN: There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
SHERIFF: And as soon as I see that you're on your way.
GRACE: John . . .?
JOHN: Grace! Just . . . let me handle this. Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk. If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it. Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
SHERIFF: I could do that. 'Course we'd have to go back into town. There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened. A whole crowd of witnesses. That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
GRACE: John . . .
