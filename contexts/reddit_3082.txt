Entry-level job asking for 5+ professional references that I don't have, what should I do?
I recently interviewed for a Medical Office Associate job (the person who checks you in and out when you go to a doctor's office) at a local hospital and the next day I received a generic email from HR via Checkster asking for 5+ professional references (supervisors or peers, no family or friend's) as part of the hiring process. I clicked on the link and it said that I had been short-listed for the position and they needed to do a reference check as the next step and gave me 2 days to complete it. 

This step in the process wasn't mentioned in the application or the interview, so I was not prepared for it at all. I am not in contact with previous supervisors or coworkers, nor did my previous positions involve any sort of email correspondence, so I wouldn't be able to provide an email address if I had the references. 

I'm kind of at a loss for what to do now. Life had been a little rough up until recently where I was homeless and living out of my car for a month. I'm trying to get back on my feet and this job would be an amazing opportunity for me. The work/education history I provided on my resume is accurate; I just don't have a personal relationship with any previous co-workers/supervisors where I could hit them up and ask them to complete a reference check. Any advice on how to move forward?
