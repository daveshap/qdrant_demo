Rejected for a job I really wanted, feeling demoralized, any tips on picking yourself back up?
So I have a decent job but it's at an incredibly small office (seriously, I'm the only employee at the moment) with no room for growth so I've been looking for a new job on and off for about a year, more seriously on for about 3 months now. About a week ago, my friend referred me to a great job at a pretty awesome company, in the city I'm looking to move to. I had a phone interview the next day, recruiter really liked me, they scheduled me for an onsite interview about 24 hours later.

The interview was an hour and a half (not with the recruiter, with 3 other people) and I thought I did pretty well. My friend who referred me said I had a good shot. Recruiter really liked me. I was trying to not get too excited, but I was feeling pretty good. Got a call yesterday being told that I didn't get the job. Recruiter said he really doesn't get very much feedback "in these kind of situations" when I asked for some, but did say that there were a ton of other referrals and it was very competitive, and that he would like to stay in contact with me.

I don't know why this is getting me so down. This was the first really good lead I've gotten in my job search, it's hard to believe I'll get another one. Does anyone have any tips on staying positive when something like this happens? I know that things like this happen all the time, but I dunno, I just feel really demoralized right now.

tldr: Got a job interview that I thought I did well on for a job I think would've been perfect for me, didn't get the job. How do you keep chugging even when you feel demoralized?
