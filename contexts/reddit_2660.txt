Teaching is an extremely difficult job that doesn’t pay well financially or emotionally. Should I leave education and follow my dream of becoming the first lawyer in my family? Or should I fight the good fight and stay in education?
After battling constant foul language, poor behavior, obscene amounts of cell phone usage during instructional time, and lack of parental support, I’m done...or at least I think I am. I expected to encounter behavioral issues as an educator in a Title 1 high school, what I didn’t expect was the blatant usage of unethical practices to increase or stabilize the graduation rate. I also didn’t expect the open conversations regarding SPED students and the need to pass them along to avoid being held accountable for not having the proper documentation on said students. 

I made the decision to not sign my contract for the upcoming school year and I am now facing a career crisis. Should I take the LSAT this fall and give Law a try or should I continue my attempt at being the change I want to see in education?

Just a little background: I recently finished my 4th year of teaching, 8th year in education. In my 4 years as an educator, 2 of those years were spent at the elementary level and 2 at the high school level. I also worked for an Ed nonprofit for 3 years and earned a masters in education from an Ivy League Ed school between my first two years as a teacher and my last two years. 

Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts, especially those who’ve made this change.
