which port to allow through ubuntu firewall I'm networking Win PC's with a ubuntu computer.  ubuntu has no problem seeing, accessing files and printing through the Win PC.  However, Win PC was not allowed to access the ubuntu computer until I disabled the ubuntu firewall.  After that, all is well.I want to enable the firewall and have installed gufw to allow limited access to the ubuntu computer.  WHICH port or ports do I let through the firewall.
