Pages loading too long on new router (Ubuntu 18.04) I have replaced my router with a new one. Internet speed is the same, but I have problem that certain pages load for too long. Google searches appear instantly, for example, but Youtube and Facebook need 10 seconds or more to load. I can't even access Messenger on Facebook. When I play video on Youtube it runs smoothly, but I have to wait very long for page to load.enp2s0: flags=4163 mtu 1500 inet 192.168.10.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.10.255 inet6 fe80::f036:3f4e:b7d4:d8eb prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20 ether ac:e2:d3:7e:89:4e txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet) RX packets 743620 bytes 1063295359 (1.0 GB) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 376777 bytes 36479304 (36.4 MB) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0
