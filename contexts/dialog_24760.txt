CARTMAN'S MOTHER: What?
KYLE'S MOTHER: Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
KYLE: I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
CARTMAN: It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
STAN: Dude!
CARTMAN: What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
KYLE'S MOTHER: Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: What is Terrance and Phillip?
KYLE'S MOTHER: Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage. Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
PRINCIPAL VICTORIA: Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
