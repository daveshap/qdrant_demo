Do any third party time stamping signature services exist? I'm wondering if there exists any trusted third-party service that I can submit a file, or just a signature of a file, and get back a signature of that file signed with the timestamp of when it was signed.Does any such service exist?I'm not looking for something complicated like a block chain - just a simple service that uses GPG or something similar.
