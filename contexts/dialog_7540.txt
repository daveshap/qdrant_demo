SONNY: He wanted to kill me!
MORETTI: It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
SONNY: I want a helicopter to get outa here! And a jet to take us to... ... wherever we want to go. Outa the country, so no little jets. A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
MORETTI: I don't know, Sonny. I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out. I got superiors, unnerstan? They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
MORETTI: Sonny, be reasonable!
SONNY: I want to see my wife. I want you to bring her down here.
MORETTI: Okay, what do you give me?
SONNY: What do you want?
MORETTI: The girl hostages.
SONNY: Nothin' doin'. I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
MORETTI: I'll see what they'll do.
