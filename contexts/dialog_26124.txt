MAJOR MANDRAKE: What's the gun for, General Ripper?
GENERAL RIPPER: Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major. I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
GENERAL RIPPER: That's right, Major.
GENERAL RIPPER: I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Oh, it's not my radio, sir. I picked it up in the communications center.
GENERAL RIPPER: I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Yes, sir. General, can I ask a question?
GENERAL RIPPER: Certainly, Major Mandrake. You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
GENERAL RIPPER: That is correct, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
GENERAL RIPPER: You know the regulations well, Major.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music? It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
GENERAL RIPPER: That's a good question, Major. Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
MAJOR MANDRAKE: Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
GENERAL RIPPER: And if that were true?
MAJOR MANDRAKE: But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
GENERAL RIPPER: Because I thought it proper, Major. Why else would you think I'd do it?
