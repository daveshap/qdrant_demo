I hate this era/time of dating and how everything is tied to online.
I hate this new age of dating everything is connected or linked directly to social media. The idea that even in a bar, club, or populated area full of real people everyone phones are out trying to show off online. I hate online dating and people inability to be honest when not desiring relationship and just want causal sex. Im tired of people first question being do you have an IG, Snapchat, or FB. I’m tired of not connecting with people in real like. I’m tired of filters and plastic surgery, and option being so big that people never want to settle down because they are always look for the next big thing. I’m sick of fake post, and vacation photos people can’t afford. I’m tired of only seeing people through a filter they create. And lastly I’m tired because i feel like I’m alone because i have no social media, and when i try to date traditionally it seems like a lost cause. I don’t want to swipe on tinder any more, or be admired simply because i look beautiful in photos.

I know it sounds stupid but.... I’m just sick of this ear of dating...
