Going on month 6 of unemployment. Had 3 interviews and no offers after sending off around 300+ applications. I am geographically disadvantaged and dead set on finding a job related to my studies/passions, however student loan debt and other financial needs are pressing. Any help appreciated.
I'm 28, and recently completed a master's LLM in Public International Law, dealing primarily with human rights and business practice. All the jobs related to this field are located in Washington DC and NYC, but I am stuck at my parents place in Birmingham, AL with no income, and no way to fund trips to these cities so that I can network. I am confident in my networking skills, and my work skills but I keep getting rejection notices, without any constructive feedback. What would you do in my situation?
