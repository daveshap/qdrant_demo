ELVIS: Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
CLARENCE: I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
ELVIS: All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
CLARENCE: Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
ELVIS: Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: I'll take that gun"
CLARENCE: That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
