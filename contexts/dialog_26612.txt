BILLY: Does this mean I can't take a shower?
RISA: No. It should be dry by now.
BILLY: What time's he coming home?
RISA: When the game's over, I guess.
NICOLE: The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
MASON: What's a ditty again?
NICOLE: It's like a song.
MASON: Oh.
MASON: What's vermin again?
NICOLE: Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
MASON: Nicole?
NICOLE: Yes.
MASON: Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
NICOLE: Don't you usually like to sit at the back? To wave at your Dad?
MASON: I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
NICOLE: Okay.
MASON: Nicole?
NICOLE: What, Mason?
NICOLE: That's right.
MASON: Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
NICOLE: Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
MASON: The people in the town?
NICOLE: Yes.
MASON: So he was mean?
NICOLE: No. Not mean. Just...very angry.
MASON: Oh.
NICOLE: Should I keep reading?
MASON: Okay.
BILLY: What are you thinking?
RISA: Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus. He won't want to go. He never does. He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
BILLY: That's because he misses you.
RISA: Yes.
BILLY: It's natural.
RISA: Your kids never cry.
BILLY: Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them. Behind the bus.
RISA: They can look forward to that.
BILLY: Sure.
RISA: Just like we look forward to this.
RISA: You're leaving.
BILLY: I better get back.
RISA: Good night, Billy.
BILLY: Good night.
NICOLE: Are you sure?
BILLY: Yeah.
NICOLE: It just seems...kind of weird.
BILLY: Why?
NICOLE: I don't know.
BILLY: Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity. Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
NICOLE: No. I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that. I really liked her.
BILLY: And she really liked you. She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
NICOLE: What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
BILLY: I'm not sure.
NICOLE: Oh. Right.
NICOLE: Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
BILLY: Goodnight, Nicole.
SAM: What took so long?
NICOLE: Nothing.
SAM: What's that?
NICOLE: Mrs. Ansel's clothing.
SAM: Does it fit?
