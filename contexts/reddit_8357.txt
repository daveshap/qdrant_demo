What are the legal merits of Atty General Sessions' argument that the DACA program is unconstitutional?
Today, Attorney General Jeff Sessions made an announcement that [the Trump administration is ending the DACA program.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/us/politics/trump-daca-dreamers-immigration.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0)  In [his remarks](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-sessions-delivers-remarks-daca) accompanying the announcement, Mr. Sessions remarked that "it was inconsistent with the Constitution’s separation of powers."

In those remarks, Mr. Sessions further quoted at some length prof. Jonathan Turley who was quoted as saying:

>“In ordering this blanket exception, President Obama was nullifying part of a law that he simply disagreed with.….If a president can claim sweeping discretion to suspend key federal laws, the entire legislative process becomes little more than a pretense…The circumvention of the legislative process not only undermines the authority of this branch but destabilizes the tripartite system as a whole.” _(elipses original to Sessions' statement)_

What are the legal merits of the argument made in Mr. Sessions' remarks?
