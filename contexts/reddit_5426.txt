Helpdesk to Technical Support
From my understanding Helpdesk doesnâ€™t necessarily require a lot of technical knowledge and generally escalates the process. 

Technical Support seems to be broken down into different departments like Hardware, Software, Network, etc. They take escalated tickets from Helpdesk.

It seems like a degree may not be needed for Helpdesk, but for Technical Support it looks like either a degree or certifications or both are needed. If I want to pursue a Technical Support position, is a degree needed? Will certifications suffice?
