COLONEL: You're Walker, right?
DANNY: Yes Sir.
COLONEL: That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
DANNY: You liked that?
COLONEL: Oh yeah. I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
DANNY: Sir?
COLONEL: I don't buy that hot dog shit. So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
DANNY: Hale-what?
COLONEL: You'll love it. No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
DANNY: Sir, I --
COLONEL: Too late for apologies, Walker.
DANNY: I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir. I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
DANNY: How's everything?
EVELYN: We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet. Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
DANNY: That might not have been such a good idea. They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield. The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
EVELYN: I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes. Do you think that's why we're meeting. To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
DANNY: I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to. Rafe was...he was lonely. He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty. The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
DANNY: Sorry.
EVELYN: He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret. Now that's all I have.
DANNY: Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
EVELYN: Well...sure.
DANNY: From the air?
EVELYN: So beautiful!
DANNY: Hang on.
