CHRIS: Oh, hi. I'm glad you made it. Did you bring anybody?
KNOX: No.
CHRIS: Ginny Danburry's here. Look for her.
KNOX: But, Chris...
CHRIS: I gotta find Chet. Make yourself at home.
NEIL: Charlie...
CHARLIE: It's Nuwanda.
NEIL: Nuwanda, what is going on?
CHARLIE: Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
PITTS: Well, of course not. It's just that... You could have warned us.
CHARLIE: I thought I'd be spontaneous. I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
NEIL: Where'd you find them?
CHARLIE: They were walking along the fence past the soccer field. Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
CAMERON: Do they go to Henley Hall?
CHARLIE: I don't think they're in school.
CAMERON: They're townies?!
CHARLIE: Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something. You afraid of them?
CAMERON: Hell no, I'm not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we're dead.
