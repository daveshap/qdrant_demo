Is it possible to detect muonium at the end of the experimental area of a particle accelerator by exciting its electron? I've been wondering: if the muonium atom is very similar to the hydrogen atom, can I detect it (at the end of the experimental area in a particle accelerator) by exciting and then unexciting its electron with a very precise laser beam (assuming that we know the values of muonium energy levels by QED)? And would the photons emitted by the laser interfer with the rest of the experience?Thanks
