HUMPERDINCK: Rise and report.
YELLIN: The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
HUMPERDINCK: Double it. My Princess must be safe.
YELLIN: The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
HUMPERDINCK: Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
BUTTERCUP: Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
BUTTERCUP: Every ship but the four you sent.
HUMPERDINCK: Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
