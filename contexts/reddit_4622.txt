my boyfriend is the only thing keeping me sane and i think he is getting tired of me
im in a long distance relationship with the most beautiful boy ive ever met. i love him so much and things were great. but lately my mental state has been deteriorizing more and more. lately i started to have severe panick attacks. when im feeling bad talking to him makes me calm down. but lately i can feel im draining his energy everytime i hit him up to talk about how much i hate myself and how much im sorry. im not telling this to him because it would be guilt tripping as fuck, but if he leaves me i will be left with literally nothing, and just the thought of it makes me fucking scared.

 i dont know what to do. i wanna get better for him, but it seems impossible. nothing i tried has worked, and im desperate.
