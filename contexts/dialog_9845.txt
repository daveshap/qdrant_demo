THE KID: I'm sorry...
FORD: Shut up, you dummy. Who did this to you?
THE KID: These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits. I think Armani. They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
FORD: Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
THE KID: Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that. I kicked their ass! Well, I tried. There were two of them you know...
FORD: Jesus, how could you be so stupid? Come on, we're going to a hospital.
THE KID: I tried to help you...!
FORD: And hey, I appreciate it...
THE KID: Where's my father? Have you even looked?
FORD: Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
THE KID: Liar! You don't care! About anything.
