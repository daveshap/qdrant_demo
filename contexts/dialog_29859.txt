DESMOND: I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
CABLE: Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a J. Edgar" coming up I think I said
DESMOND: Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
CABLE: You're lucky I am not wasting you.
DESMOND: Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be Federal". With or without the semantics of all this
CABLE: A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
DESMOND: That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
CABLE: Out back in our morgue.
CABLE: It's 4:30. We close at five.
DESMOND: We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
