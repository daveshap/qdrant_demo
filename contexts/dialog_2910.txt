NICK: What did you pay Nilsen?
CATHERINE: Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
NICK: What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
CATHERINE: What if I call you Nicky?
NICK: My wife used to call me that.
CATHERINE: I know, Nicky, but I like it.
CATHERINE: Cheers. My friends call me Catherine.
NICK: What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
CATHERINE: Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately. You don't have any coke, do you? I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
NICK: There's Pepsi in the fridge.
CATHERINE: It's not the same thing, is it?
