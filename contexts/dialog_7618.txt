DONNIE: Dr. Monnitoff?
DR. MONNITOFF: Donnie.
DONNIE: I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
DR. MONNITOFF: So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
DONNIE: So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
DR. MONNITOFF: Theoretically.
DONNIE: -- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
DR. MONNITOFF: A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
DONNIE: So... that's it?
DR. MONNITOFF: The basic principles of time travel are there. So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
DONNIE: Like a DeLorean.
DR. MONNITOFF: A metal craft of any kind.
