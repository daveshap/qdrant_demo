1st Mars landing story-Read in eighties Trying to remember a \"first landing on Mars\" story.  Read in the eighties, short story, not a novel. Basically the story has an Apollo-style crew, I think, two guys in a lander and one in an orbiting craft.  The two guys in the lander come out and what they see is an Edgar Rice Burroughs kind of landscape.  The guy in the mothership is convinced, of course that they are hallucinating.  Finally one of them takes off his helmet. His buddy on the surface sees him walking around with no ill effects, but the guy in the mothership reports that his suit telemetry says he's dead.  Finally, the second guy takes his helmet off too.  The end of the story has the two heading to the towers off in the distance while the other crewmember mourns them as dead.
