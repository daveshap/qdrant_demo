RICHARD: I can't ...
HANNAH: Thou must.
HANNAH: It's a gift, Richard. This law school is a gift from your brother.
RICHARD: Did he have to die for me to get it?!
HANNAH: It's meant to make us stronger. Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur. God has chosen thee to survive ...
RICHARD: What about happiness, Mother?
HANNAH: Thou must find thy peace at the center, Richard. Strength in this life. Happiness in the next.
