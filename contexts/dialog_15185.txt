LUDWIG: Oskar!
OSKAR: Ludwig?
LUDWIG: This is filed incorrectly!
OSKAR: Here too! They're all in a dreadful muddle!
KAFKA: Gabriela! -- you did get away.
GABRIELA: I knew you walked this way to work. I wanted to find you before they did.
KAFKA: -- I've just come from the Castle. It's over.
GABRIELA: Over? It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
KAFKA: Gabriela ...?
GABRIELA: Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss. It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
