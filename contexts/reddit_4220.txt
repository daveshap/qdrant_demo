Post-Date Depression
Does anyone else get this? I have been on three dates with this guy and I think he’s great. I went over to his apartment last night and we had a wonderful evening.  I guess I get kind of a “high” from being with someone who is interested in me romantically and then I feel kind of a “low” the next day. I think I am sort of anxious in the dating phase because I’m not sure where it will go and I hate wasting time.
