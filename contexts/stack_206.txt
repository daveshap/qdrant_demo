MBP connects to WiFi but not to internet This happens periodically, but I still don\u2019t know why....very frustrating.2011 MacBook Pro, High Sierra 10.13.5. 10 other devices in the house using WiFi no problem, between Galaxy S9, 3 iPads, an HP laptop and numerous smart TVs.... this has happened at home as well as on the road and I know that it is my MBP, but usually I manage to fix it- not this time. Have reset both SMC and PRAM. Have deleted WiFi service and re-added it. Have manually entered IPv4 addresses and DNS servers. Probably did some other things that I don\u2019t remember anymore... Restarted numerous times. Don\u2019t know what to do anymore... usually it comes back by now, but no such luck. What else can I try?  I have even been in Terminal running some commands to try to clear my caches etc...When I ping a DNS server in Terminal like Google\u2019s, 8.8.8.8, I get responses, but I have to manually set my IPv4 address and subnet mask to 255.255.255.0. When everything is configured like normal, i.e. IPv4 using DHCP and IPv6 configured automatically, I do not have a self-assigned IP address, but it does show me having an IPv6 address, which is weird and don\u2019t recall seeing that before, usually it is an IPv4 address. When I get my IP address in terminal, it is not a class C, starting in 192, but rather a class B starting with 169 and the subnet mask is then 255.255.0.0, which I never see.  I also cannot boot into Safe mode for some reason. When i get to the logo screen and the progress bar underneath, the progress bar gets halfway and then the screen goes dark and it powers off. I can boot into recovery mode and if I use the Get Help Online section and open Safari, I GET ON THE INTERNET JUST FINE.... so what the heck gives?? Doesn\u2019t make any sense... Please help...Thank you!
