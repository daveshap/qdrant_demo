HARDING: I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
MCMURPHY: Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
HARDING: She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.

MARTINI: Me. Hit me!
