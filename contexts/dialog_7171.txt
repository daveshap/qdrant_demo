JOHN: Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
SARAH: Gasparilla?
JOHN: He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
SARAH: Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
JOHN: That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
SARAH: We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
JOHN: Captain Rhodes and his Red Coat Bees. They could sting, sister. We know you came up against 'em. We been watchin' you since you landed. Couldn't help. I'm sorry for that. We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the end of everything.
