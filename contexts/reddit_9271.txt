Just got my direct deposit and cried in my car when I saw it
I got a  promotion at work. I went from waiting tables, to being a trainer while serving, to now being a key holding assistant manager. The hours suck and I have a lot of things about my new position don’t enjoy, such as working 50+ hours a week and being on a rotating schedule. But I get $16 an hour. That’s huge to me. Ever since I graduated college in 2010, I’ve struggled and not even made it paycheck to paycheck. 
I’ve been in this new position for almost two months.  I have a little over $2,000 in my daily account that I’m using to pay my bills and my debts. Most importantly, I have my first emergency fund with $550. It’s worth all the hard work I’m putting in to make myself stable, for the first time ever.
