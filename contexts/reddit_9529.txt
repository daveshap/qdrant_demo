So far this year I've paid off my wife's LASIK surgery and just yesterday paid off our refrigerator
Over $3300 in debt gone, and now I have $235/month to snowball toward the last $10,000 of my student loans.  Hopefully with a few more adjustments to our spending, I can pay those off around the time my wife's law school student loan payments start coming due November 2019.
