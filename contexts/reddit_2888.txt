I keep changing jobs and I love it... but should I?
I switch jobs quite frequently. My first post-college job I was there for 2 1/2 years, my next job I was there for 1 year, and after that I've only been working at this company for 6 months and I'm already ready to move on. I've been making large salary jumps and I make a lot of money for only being 25 years old, which was always a big reason I would change jobs. But I also get very bored at different jobs very easily. Additionally, all my job changes have been in-line with my career goals.

That said, even though I *really* enjoy starting at new companies and enjoying the challenges that entail those changes, I also feel guilty for not keeping the same job for at least a couple years. Can someone help me with how I should feel about this?
