EARLY: Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
ADELE: I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
EARLY: Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn... ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
ADELE: What'll we do out there?
EARLY: Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
ADELE: You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
EARLY: Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
ADELE: Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
EARLY: I heard that.
CARRIE: What did he sound like on the phone?
BRIAN: Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
BRIAN: I like that.
CARRIE: I still think we should have met them first.
BRIAN: Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
