JEHUDA: Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
SZPILMAN: You're amazing, Jehuda.
JEHUDA: No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
SZPILMAN: So, what's the news?
JEHUDA: The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
SZPILMAN: I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
JEHUDA: Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
SZPILMAN: Jehuda, give me something to do.
JEHUDA: You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
SZPILMAN: But I want to help, I want to.
JEHUDA: You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
SZPILMAN: There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
JEHUDA: There are always notices going up.
