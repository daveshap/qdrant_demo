ANTHONY: This morning.
DIGNAN: Where was I?
ANTHONY: You were asleep.
DIGNAN: He told you and you let him do it.
ANTHONY: He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
DIGNAN: If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?

DIGNAN: I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
ANTHONY: If you say so.
DIGNAN: If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
ANTHONY: I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
DIGNAN: Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
