KEOUGH: We are here on official business.
HECTOR: Cocktail?
KEOUGH: <u>No</u>!! What's with digging the holes?
HECTOR: They come on land and they're brazen. They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
KEOUGH: Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!
HECTOR: Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
KEOUGH: No!! Out!
KEOUGH: You listen to me. The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
HECTOR: And you like me.
KEOUGH: I do <u>not</u> like you.
HECTOR: Deep down, gut check. I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
