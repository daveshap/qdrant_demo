A classic: Unrequited Love
Dating is an adventure into the unknown with some of the highest hopes we humans are capable of.

You start off completely neutral, ready for anything, mentally prepping yourself for all possible outcomes.

But sometimes, the moment you meet someone new, it's instantly and unequivocally clear: you are in love.

This person takes over your thoughts. You seem to have lost control and desire one thing only: to love them unconditionally.

You know it's unhealthy, and yet you can't help yourself. It transcends everything you do, blinding you to the likely and painful truth: it's not mutual.

Unrequited love is one of the most painful outcomes in dating, and it's all too real. 

To all my unrequited lovers out there, you may feel alone, but you are not, I guarantee it. Find solace in this, and never lose hope â™¥
