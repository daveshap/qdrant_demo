NICKY: I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
GINGER: Oh, you're right, I know. It's... well, I was just -
NICKY: What? What?
GINGER: Nothin'.
NICKY: What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
GINGER: I don't -
NICKY: Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
GINGER: Yeah?
NICKY: Yeah.
GINGER: Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank... could help me get my jewelry out? There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
NICKY: Let me think about that.
GINGER: Okay.
NICKY: See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
GINGER: Mm-hm.
NICKY: You know?
GINGER: Yeah. 'Cause, you know, He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
NICKY: Hm.
GINGER: He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
NICKY: Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
GINGER: He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
NICKY: No, he wouldn't. I would have. And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously. Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
GINGER: I didn't. I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
NICKY: You did. You're right.
GINGER: Exactly.
NICKY: You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
GINGER: I did what you told me to.
NICKY: Yes, you did.
GINGER: 'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
NICKY: Yeah. Boy, he really fucked himself up out here - - didn't he?
GINGER: Sure did.
NICKY: Everything went to his head.
