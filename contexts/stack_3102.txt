Turning on headlights near light speed If i turn headlights on in a car at v = 0.99*c, will the headlight speed be 0.01*c? I know speed of light is always the same but it really confuses me? My question is, does space contract so much at that speed that even light at just the speed of 0.01*c will appear to be 299792 km/s? It seems to me space contraction and time dilation make the slow light appear to be normal light at normal light speed. Can someone explain to me please?
