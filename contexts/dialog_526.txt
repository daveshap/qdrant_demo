ZURIA: She costs a hundred thousand lire.
SANDRO: You're kidding!
ZURIA: No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth, if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... But you had something you wanted to ask me?
SANDRO: I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fiancâ€š.
ZURIA: Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
SANDRO: Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information ...
ZURIA: As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
SANDRO: Is that possible?
ZURIA: Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
SANDRO: Is that far from here?
ZURIA: About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
SANDRO: Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
ZURIA: Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
SANDRO: You really must do me this one favor.
ZURIA: Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
SANDRO: Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
