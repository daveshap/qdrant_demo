Declare table as not replicable How can I make sure that a certain table is not selected as an article in a publication? So that this table is never replicated (even by error).The replication for the database is setup by different people and one particular table should never be included in the replication. Can we make that table non selectable in the publication wizard (the step where the articles are added to the publication) or is there any way we can use the database schema to define that this table is not available as article in a publication?Type of replication used: merge replicationThanks!
