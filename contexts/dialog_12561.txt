NEIL: Let's follow 'em.
NEIL'S FRIEND #1: What for, dickweed?
NEIL: It's fun.
NEIL'S FRIEND #1: Grow up, Dreyer.
RITA: You've done a really great job with the house. It's great!
JULIE: Yeah. There's still a lot I want to do. It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here. Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
RITA: So you don't have anything concrete?
JULIE: No, I told you. A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
RITA: Have you just plain asked him?
JULIE: I've asked him what's wrong.
RITA: And?
JULIE: The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything. He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
RITA: I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
JULIE: I've tried to get him to agree to one. I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
RITA: Don't drive yourself crazy. It's probably nothing.
