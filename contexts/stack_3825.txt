Statistical methods for analyzing results of preference study I've chosen to compare the results of three different machine-learning models outputting the mouth animation of a talking 3D model for my thesis using a user preference study.Users will see two videos at a time, each from one of the models, and indicate which they think look the most natural, or if they are neutral. The videos are synchronized. For each user, one comparison will be made for each sentence (out of a set of sentences) and for each pair of models to be compared.Now, I could arrange the data as simply A vs. B, B vs. C, and A vs. C. Then, let's say A was preferred a majority of the time over B (a majority out of a total of sentences*subjects comparisons between them). What test should I use to see if this is statistically significant? Could I even just compare them all at the same time by treating the \"wins\" as \"points\" to get three sums or means representing \"scores\" and then use a repeated measures ANOVA followed by e.g. Tukey HSD?A lot of methods (Tukey's HSD, Student's t-test...) have the assumption that the score in A needs to be independent to the score in B, but since this is a preference study, they aren't really independent, right? E.g. if there's a total of 20 un-neutral comparisons, if A wins 15, then B wins 5.I would greatly appreciate any insight!
