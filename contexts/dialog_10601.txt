MARGARET: Everyhing go off all right?
CARTER: Fine... I want to talk to you.
MARGARET: What about?
CARTER: Doreen.
MARGARET: She's nothing to do with me.
CARTER: What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
MARGARET: No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
CARTER: Hold it! Hold it! Who killed Frank, Margaret?
MARGARET: Killed? I don't know anything about it.
CARTER: Really.
MARGARET: I must go. I'm in a hurry.
CARTER: I want to talk to you later.
MARGARET: I can't.
CARTER: Tomorrow morning, then?
