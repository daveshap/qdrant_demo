Inquiring about a potential on-campus offer?
I'm in the thick of the job search. I have been interviewing with quite a few places, and there was one that went really well (at least to me). The interviewer told me their institution is also doing hiring for higher-up positions (like Dean of Students) and it may take a bit for htem to meet with who they need to to discuss about which candidates to bring on campus, and they told me to hang tight and I'd either receive an e-mail from them or someone in HR. Like I said, the interview went really well and I'm fairly confident that I will be selected for an on-campus interview. I interviewed two weeks ago, for reference.

I was just selected for an on-campus interview with a different institution. I likely will not be going there until the last week of June. I am worried about going to the on-campus and having it be a quick turnaround and have them offer me the job the next day or something. The first institution is my "top choice" for jobs, but of course that may change when I do the on-campus for the second institution.

This turned into a ramble. Would it be annoying if I e-mailed the interviewer at the first institution and asked about their process/if they know if I'll be selected for an on-campus? If it wouldn't be, how should I word it?
