Control + W shortcut not working in Finder and Terminal I set CtrlW as a shortcut for all applications in the System Preferences => Keyboard => Shortcuts.They are working in many apps (like Safari), but not in Terminal and in Finder.Is CtrlW a system shortcut?I shouldn't have conflicts with other shortcuts with the same combination of keys, the yellow warning triangle is not shown.
