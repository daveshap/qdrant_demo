I have a job interview for a promotion today!
Send good vibes my way please! ☺️😊😁

Update: thank you so much everyone for the positive messages! I walked in feeling super confident, but.... 

I did not get the job. It turns out that I was vastly unprepared for the interview and I had no idea. The interviewer (internal promotion) explained to me that other applicants had gone to the location of the available job (store site) and spoke with different employees they would be working with, requested detailed financial statements and wrote up 90 day day-by-day plans for the store. 

Looking back now it seems obvious, but having been a temporary employee of that store when they were short staffed I figured I already had an insight to it and the day to day operations. I had asked a senior employee who has had the position I was interviewing for what I needed to do to prepare and he never mentioned any of these things. I know he didn’t do it maliciously, he’s a very scatterbrained person and was hand picked for the roll rather than going though the application process. 

Lucky for me my company wants employees who are eager to grow. The interview turned into a discussion about my current location and what is expected of me the next time I apply for a promotion. 

I was terrified that  I would make a catastrophic mistake during my interview and I did. While being so worried about my future with the company and being black listed if I messed up I had forgotten that the interviewers and managers are good and honest people who want to help their employees grow and succeed. Even if we do fail, sometimes there’s a hand ready to help us back up.
