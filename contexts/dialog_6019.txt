ALFREDO: Did you ever see her again?
SALVATORE: No. And nobody knows where she is.
ALFREDO: It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
SALVATORE: Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!' You remember the story of the soldier and the princess?
SALVATORE: Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him...
ALFREDO: Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed. When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am.
SALVATORE: Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?
ALFREDO: No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder. Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
