ENID: Relax, Seymour, relax...
SEYMOUR: That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face! KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
ENID: So, why did you bring this along?
SEYMOUR: I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
ENID: This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
SEYMOUR: I'm not holding my breath in that department.
SEYMOUR: What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
ENID: Jesus, Seymour.
