STEVE: Think you can get me any of that?
EMMI: Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
STEVE: Mine's the Eleventh.
EMMI: But... he only wrote nine, Major.
STEVE: I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
EMMI: No. Ours was damaged.
STEVE: What's in those files?
EMMI: The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires. Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtw√§ngler?
STEVE: You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
