Is The U.S. Better Off With Or Without Its Central Bank, The Federal Reserve
Adam Kokesh, a Libertarian Party member, has promised that he would [abolish the Fed on the first day he is elected](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/presidential-candidate-vows-to-abolish-federal-government-on-day-1-then-resign).

The LP has accused that the Fed has [failed its intended mission](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/02/09/5-reasons-libertarians-hate-the-federal-reserve.aspx), citing examples such as the [2008 Financial Crash](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/blame-fed), a [low value of the Dollar and other monterary units](https://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/advisor/federal-100-years-destroying-purchase-power-money-015016988.html), and lambasted the cost of [bank bailouts on American people.](https://www.thebalance.com/what-was-the-bank-bailout-bill-3305675)

They also say that the Federal Reserve increases the incentive for [high risk in the financial sector](https://www.lp.org/federal-reserve-creates-dangerous-amounts-of-dodgy-debt/), that the Fed takes away financial power from Congress - which they say is [unconstitutional](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/041515/why-federal-reserve-independent.asp), and [the independance of the agency, mixed with the control over financial systems, makes it undemocratic and dangerous](https://theweek.com/articles/442121/federal-reserves-independence-dangerous-undemocratic-boon-wall-street).

The LP and many Libertarians have proposed replacing the Fed with an asset based system, pointing out successes of decentralised systems such as [blockchain currency](https://qz.com/1284178/almost-half-of-cryptocurrency-and-bitcoin-bros-identify-as-libertarian/) and the effects the gold standard had during the [Industrial Revolution](https://www.hillsdale.edu/educational-outreach/free-market-forum/2012-archive/the-argument-for-returning-to-the-gold-standard-the-lessons-of-contemporary-history/).


However, supporters of the Federal Reserve have pointed out that the bank bailouts of 2008 [have been paid back in full](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/11/17/americas-bank-bailouts-worked/), and that the stimulus and stability provided by the Fed [prevented the 2008 recession from getting to levels seen during the Great Depression](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/economic-intelligence/2015/10/23/the-great-recession-would-have-been-much-worse-without-stimulus-tarp), and provides [stability and insurance in the financial markets.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation)

Throughout U.S. history, it has had 5 periods with [different banking history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States) - three [with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System) central banking, and two [without](https://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-the-free-bank-era-2013-2?r=US&IR=T). How has the system fared, comparatively, with and without central banking, and does this lead to an indicator of pros and cons of these systems?

Is the U.S. better off with or without a central banking system?

Have there been any examples of other countries not having a central banking system? What happened?
