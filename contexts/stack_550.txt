Remote GUI, Windows client, Ubuntu 16.04 server I need a GUI access to my remote Linux machine, from a windows laptop.To this end, I tried 2 methods as of yet:a) installed xrdp and tigervnc. It works but it's damn slow, plus I'm worried by the security issues (see below).b) ssh -X. This allows to have single X11 applications on my laptop, which would suffice, but strangely enough, it is even more slow than the full desktop with xrdp.So, I have a couple of questions:May you suggest alternative, quicker methods?What about security with xrdp/vnc? Can it be tunneled with ssh without further speed sacrifices? If yes, how to do it? If not, can I authenticate passwordless, with some ssh-like encrypted keys?Thanks a lot.
