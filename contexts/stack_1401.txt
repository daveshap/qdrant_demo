Electric Vehicle Charging I have a few queries related to EV charging:(1) When we refer to 'X kW' charger, is it that the charger is taking in X kW power and delivering power = X kW times the efficiency of the charger to the battery OR is it that X kW is what is being delivered and so the actual power being consumed from mains is X kW divided by efficiency.(2) If the nominal voltage of car battery is 375V and one wants to charge the battery at a fast charging station which has chargers rated at 800V, how is the charging going to take place? Is the charger itself going to convert it to (say) 400V before delivering the power or is there already a DC/DC converter inside the car which converts 800V (or any other voltage) to 400V for charging?(3) Does an EV have three different ports for 1-phase AC charging, 3-phase AC charging and DC fast charging or is that a single port can accommodate both single and three phase AC charging and then there is another one for DCFC?
