LYDIA: I've never been in an apartment above a store. You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
ANNE: Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
LYDIA: No, thank you.
LYDIA: Will it hurt?
ANNE: That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
ANNE: ...So he says to me, you'll never find another man like me"...I said
LYDIA: You threw him out?
LYDIA: My parents were divorced.
ANNE: It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say, divorce is the sister-in-law of death"."
ANNE: ...SO...anybody special in your life?
LYDIA: Do I look like I have someone special?
ANNE: Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
LYDIA: Well, there's nobody special!
ANNE: Fine.
LYDIA: I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
ANNE: What?
LYDIA: Meeting ... people.
ANNE: Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
LYDIA: I never really...went through a... dating period.
ANNE: It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
JACK: Will you stand still so I can do this!
PARRY: I'm sorry....I'm just so excited. You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
JACK: In a bar called Hellfire.
PARRY: Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
JACK: No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
PARRY: What are the other reasons?
