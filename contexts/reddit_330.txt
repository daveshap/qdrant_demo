One piece of advice
You’ve been there before. About to graduate high school, but you don’t know what to expect next. 

You have people all around telling you what you should do, but how do you know what to listen to and what to disregard. 

Knowing what you know now, what would be the one piece of advice you’d give to your 18-year-old chills graduating HS in a few weeks?

I’m not the smartest person in the world. I never went to college. I come from a rough household. 

I can’t possibly pass on information that I do not know. 

So, I’m asking you...

What would be the one piece of advice you’d give your kid who is graduating HS?

What do you wish you knew then that you know now???

I sincerely appreciate your support. 

Thank you,
Cory
