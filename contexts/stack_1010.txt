Grub theme terminal-box appearing, why? So I downloaded a grub theme off of gnome-look.org and it works amazingly well! The only thing I don't understand about it is why after selecting what to boot into, a black box resembling a terminal(with no text) will appear in the middle of the screen before moving on with the boot process?In the theme.txt file it mentions a terminal-box and even has font color and types defined, but there's no text that appears. Is this meant to be a box for my boot text to show up on? If so, how would I do make that work?Thanks for your time :)
