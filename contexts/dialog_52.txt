BIANCA: He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
CHASTITY: Is he oily or dry?
BIANCA: Combination. I don't know -- I thought he'd be different. More of a gentleman...
CHASTITY: Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
BIANCA: Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
CHASTITY: All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
KAT: Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
BIANCA: I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
