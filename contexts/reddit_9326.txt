I Just Opened My University Award Letter
And it’s so much better than I expected it to be!! 

I’m going into my fourth year (only 3 semesters left!) of college, and I was dreading trying to figure out how to pay for this last leg. Up until now, I was able to make due with some federal student loans (which have covered about half each year) and a payment plan to pay the rest out of pocket. I’d worked and saved up a ton in high school, and my grandpa gave me my relatively small inheritance fund to help me pay for school (my brother used his to pay for his wedding). 
 
After this last semester though, I was down to $150 in my bank account, a closed up savings account, and a $15k tuition bill staring me down. I work as much as I can over the summer AND during the semester, but there’s no way I can come up with more than a couple grand in that time. I was dreading having to take out private loans because the federal loans are bad enough as is, but the private loan industry scares me. 

My university just emailed me to let me know my award letter was released online. I opened it, and I was floored!! I was offered the usual $7.5k in federal loans — PLUS $8.5k in GRANTS!! This is the first year I’ve been awarded ANY grant money!! And it’s enough to cover the rest of my tuition for next year, plus enough to put in a savings account to help pay for my final semester. I’m so happy! I have this huge weight lifted straight off my shoulders!! 

I’ve got some medical and dentist’s bills that I’ve been avoiding until I had paid off the last of my tuition for this semester, so I’m not totally out of the woods yet. Plus I do have a pretty big bill of loans I owe to the federal government, but I can pay those off when I’m working full time. I just can’t get over this!!
