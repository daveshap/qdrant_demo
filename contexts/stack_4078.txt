Biking on via Appia Antica I'm going to stay in Rome for a few days and I would like to have a bike trip on via Appia Antica one day. I do not intend to have a tour, just rent a bike and ride on my own for a couple of hours.What I need to find out is where can I find a bike rental service nearby and how do I get to the place from Ponte Sisto by public transport.Thank you for information.
