HARRY: I'm late.
HELEN: Me too.
HELEN: How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
HARRY: Yeah. You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
HELEN: That's fabulous Harry.
HARRY: Yeah, it was wild.
