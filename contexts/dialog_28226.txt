CAUCHON: Jeanne, I beg of you... sign! In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you! If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death! Is that what you want??
JEANNE: No... I want to be confessed.
CAUCHON: Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
JEANNE: And may I go to Mass?
CAUCHON: As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
