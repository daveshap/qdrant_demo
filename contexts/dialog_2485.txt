STEPHEN: You okay?
BRIAN: I waited... I would have fucking waited...
STEPHEN: That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
BRIAN: Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
STEPHEN: You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today? What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
