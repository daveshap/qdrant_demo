AMY: Tom? Where have you been... ?
WELLES: Amy, just listen. Take Cindy and get out of the house. Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
AMY: What's wrong? Are you alright?
WELLES: I'm okay. Please, honey, I can't explain. Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out. I'm on my way. I'll be back at the house in three hours. Call me from the hotel when you get there
AMY: ... What's going on?
WELLES: Just do it, Amy, please, go.
