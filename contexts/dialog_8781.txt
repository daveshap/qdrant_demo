MERLIN: It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
UTHER: To kill and be king, is that all?
MERLIN: Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king...
UTHER: You strike me with words as hard as steel.
MERLIN: They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
