AGNES: It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop. Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
MARTHA: Agnes... Agnes...
AGNES: Stay away from me...
MARTHA: Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
AGNES: No...
MARTHA: He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
AGNES: Not your fault...
MARTHA: Agnes who did you see?
AGNES: I hate him...
MARTHA: Of course you do. Who was it?
AGNES: I hate him for what he did to me.
MARTHA: Yes.
AGNES: For what he made me go through.
MARTHA: Who?
AGNES: I hate him.
MARTHA: Agnes, who did this to you?
AGNES: God! It was God. And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
MARTHA: Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
MOTHER MIRIAM: That's enough.
MARTHA: Agnes, what happened to the baby?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She can't remember.
MARTHA: What happened to the baby?
AGNES: It was dead.
MARTHA: It was alive wasn't it?
AGNES: I don't remember.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh, don't do this!
MARTHA: Wasn't it!
