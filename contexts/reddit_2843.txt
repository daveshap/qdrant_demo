I graduate HS in June and don’t know what I want to do. Can I have some advice?
I’m 18 and a senior in high school and quite frankly life after high schools terrifies me.
I’ve already decided I’m not going to college. I can’t stand school, I literally stare at the clock for half the day. Combine this with the fact that I’m just not that bright of a person on must subjects. I’m an average student grade wise (B’s and C’s with A’s in those easy electives).
I’ve never really had a set career that I’ve wanted to pursue. I’m really interested in aviation but I just suck at math and anything science or physics related.
I also tend to be kind of anti-social. I like being alone and private when I’m not in school or at my part time cashier job at a local grocery store. I don’t get invited to the typical high school parties and the such.
I’m kind of lost and need some help. Thanks!
