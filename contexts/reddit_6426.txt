AWS (Seattle) experience? I have an interview today
An internal Amazon recruiter contacted me for a legal role with AWS in Seattle. Always nice to be approached, that's for sure. I'm solidly based in L.A., but this is very tempting. If all goes well, of course.They cover relocation costs, and I already know Amazon pays top of market. The corporate culture at Amazon, however, and especially Amazon Studios, has a terrible reputation. I got to a final interview years ago for the Studios and their arrogance was unbelievable. Not to mention it was a 6 hour gauntlet that forced me to take a day off of work! That said, I'm wondering if maybe AWS and not being in L.A. is a different story?

Does anyone here have direct experience working for AWS or know someone reliable who does? Just hoping to have an idea of what I might be getting into. Thanks in advance!
