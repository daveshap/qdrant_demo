I have a girlfriend, but I’ve realised I’m gay
I’ll get straight to the point, i’ve been with an amazing girl for almost 6 months, and during that time i’ve gradually realised that while I do have love for her, im just not at all attracted to girls and i just can’t see myself marrying a woman. anyone have any advice for what to do?
