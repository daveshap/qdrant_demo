I SWEAR I'M STRAIGHT
Good day fellas. So, there's this girl I'm friends with who likes me but I swear I'm straight. I mean I actually support LGBT rights, I'm an heterosexual ally. It's not the first time someone with the same sex told me the liked in a totally not platonic way and I'm starting to get bothered that I'm turning into a magnet thing or something. That'll be very unpleasant for me to be. I don't want our friendship to be awkward but I really wanna reject her because I cant just tell her to wait(for nothing). Please tell me what to do with this situation and what to tell her. Thank you so much.
