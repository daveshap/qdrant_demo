MRS. STANWYK: John Ultramalensky?
FLETCH: Hi.
MRS. STANWYK: Hi.
FLETCH: I was hoping you'd say that.
MRS. STANWYK: Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
FLETCH: Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
MRS. STANWYK: I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
FLETCH: I ordered lunch.
MRS. STANWYK: You ordered it here?
FLETCH: Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
MRS. STANWYK: Down boy.
MRS. STANWYK: I really should change.
FLETCH: No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
MRS. STANWYK: I mean put clothes on.
FLETCH: Here, take mine.
