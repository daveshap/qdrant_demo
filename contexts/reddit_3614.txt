Difference between being needy & expressing your needs
I find there is a big difference between the two, but society lumps them all into one and guilts people for it. 

In relationships, it’s OK to have needs within reason and anyone you’re in a relationship with that tells you they can’t meet them, just isn’t the person for you and that doesn’t make you needy. 

I think that’s separate and apart from people who use love as escapism and put heavy demands on a person because they hope it will make them happy internally. Another person can’t be responsible for making you happy, but another person can play a role in bringing joy to your life.

I find many women with low self-esteem question whether they are asking for too much and in reality they are asking for the bare minimum. That’s not needy. You’re just dating someone who is unwilling or can’t meet those needs. 

The last guy I dated I said “hey I like to talk on the phone sometimes” and he had excuses why he couldn’t, not even one day. I almost reverted back into my old thinking of "maybe I am asking too much?" No, I’m not and it’s not needy. 

Having needs is not negative.
