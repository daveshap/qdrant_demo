Does "school choice" hurt the public school system?
With "school choice" being a hot button term with the recent confirmation of Betsy Devos, I started some of my own research into the impact of school choice, specifically the voucher system. 

According to [this](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED510451.pdf) study of the DC voucher system, vouchers students did no better in reading or math nor were they more satisfied. However, their parents were more satisfied.

However, I can't find or understand the impact of the voucher system on the public *schools*. Does taking students out of public schools have an impact on the actual school performance itself? Other students performance? Teacher burnout?

Edit: Thanks to the folks that provided data - that's what I was looking for. I'm looking forward to delving into them. 

To those that provided anecdotes, while I appreciate the response, it wasn't really what I was after. I think that kind of thing is against this sub (although I'm pretty new here).
