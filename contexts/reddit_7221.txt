Was this a critical mistake I made at work?
I am 22 years old. I work in a new hospital cafe doing Utility/Inventory. This cafe opened in July, and I have been working there since August. It's my first job. Typically I don't work out front serving food and what not. Since we were short two people today and it was busy, my manager had me serving food today. I have not been trained or prepared to do this. He just threw me out there.

I think I did pretty well even though I was nervous and I had to ask my coworkers lots of questions on how to do things.

However, there was one thing in particular that I messed up on and I am beating myself up over it.

This week at work we are selling tacos and nachos. As I was serving a few people, some of them asked if they could have like their salsa and stuff on the side. As I was putting their food in the containers, I like put the salsa outside the container to itself. Like you have the tacos and stuff in the container with plastic wrap, and I put like the salsa outside the plastic wrap to itself. I now realize that was not the best way to do it.

I didn't know until a coworker mentioned it that we have plastic cups for side stuff to be placed in. I was upset with myself that I ruined a few customers servings. Also for one lady, I accidentally put salsa on her food container and it was dripping on the side. I felt bad about that. I directed her where our napkins are.

I didn't know though. I didn't know that we had those plastic cups. Had I known that, I would've put their side stuff in them. The way I was doing it was kind of sloppy.

Doing things like this is how you lose customers. I would hate to be the reason why customers don't come back.

This was my first time serving and I was not trained to do it.

Was this a terrible mistake?
