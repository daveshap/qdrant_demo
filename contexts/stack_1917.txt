Does the sentence \"taxi is a business card of a city\" make sense to native speakers? Or better alternatives? In Chinese, we often say X is a business card or showcase of a city to indicate that X is often the first thing a visitor will see/experience upon the arrival and X might determine the visitor's first impression of the city.Does the literally translated \"taxi is a business card of a city\" make sense? Or if there is already an alternative in native speakers's everyday English?
