Question for recruiters/HR - Do you ever challenge the low pay offered for some roles?
I say this because I have worked research analysis, insight, management intelligence, business intelligence, etc. 

I have worked in that arena for over 10 years and I am still staggered by the low pay offered for some very highly technical roles. 

I just saw a job that needed:

* Advanced SQL

* R / Python

* Extensive experience of PowerBI / Tableau

* Advanced Microsoft Dynamics 365 skills

Amongst other extensive and highly technical demands, I think including 5+ years in analysis. 

All for a piffling £20-25k

Bearing in mind there are still plenty jobs out there are £35k+ that just need advanced Excel skills or jobs with similar (but not as much) skills for £55k± (sometimes as high as £80k).

Do you ever challenge the employer? Lower their expectations? What do they say?
