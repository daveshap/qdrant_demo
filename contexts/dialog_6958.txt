JENNIFER: Where?
FRIDA: Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
JENNIFER: I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
FRIDA: Holy shit, I'm a freak.
JENNIFER: You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal.
JENNIFER: Hey, did you get contacts?
FRIDA: Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
GREGORY: You hungry?
FRIDA: Starving.
