JACK: I need to know where Tyler is. Can't you help me?
BANDAGED PROPRIETOR: Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
JACK: There's no one else here.
BANDAGED PROPRIETOR: I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
JACK: Look at my face. I'm a member. I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
BANDAGED PROPRIETOR: I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
JACK: You are a moron.
BANDAGED PROPRIETOR: I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
