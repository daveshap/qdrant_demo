HAROLD: But they'll put me in jail.
MAUDE: Really. Just put it there, Harold.
MAUDE: They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company. That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking? Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
HAROLD: Maude, do you think you can help me?
MAUDE: What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
