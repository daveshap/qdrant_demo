MARIAN: I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
MISCHA: And where is she?
MARIAN: She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
MISCHA: So, you come here all by yourself?
MARIAN: Uh, yes. My husband passed away recently ...
MISCHA: ... Oh ...
MARIAN: ... And the children thought I should take a trip.
MISCHA: Yeah.
MARIAN: I'm from South Dakota. Where are you from?
MISCHA: Moscow.
MARIAN: Ohhh. Do you know the East Village?
MISCHA: Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
MARIAN: You mean it's dangerous?
MISCHA: Nah, not dangerous. Not that dangerous. Not during the day.
