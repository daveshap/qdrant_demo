HOLLY: I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
MICKEY: Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
HOLLY: Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you! I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you. Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music. I don't know where you went, went wrong.
HOLLY: Do you mind? I'm-I'm my own person.
MICKEY: Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
HOLLY: Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
MICKEY: Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.
