LENORE'S VOICE: Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
THEO: Who is this?
LENORE'S VOICE: You mustn't hang up.
THEO: Do I know you?
LENORE: I've been trying to get someone -- anyone. For hours ...
THEO: If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
LENORE: You don't understand.
THEO: No. <u>You</u> don't understand! You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates. And I've got no time to screw around.
LENORE: Will you let me explain!
THEO: And what're you whispering for?
LENORE: I can't talk any louder. They might hear.
THEO: Lady, try making some sense.
LENORE: You may be our only chance. I don't know if I can do this again.
THEO: What'd you do! Just pick my number out of the air?
LENORE: They smashed the phone. I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
THEO: Who smashed the phone?
LENORE: They're holding my husband downstairs.
THEO: Sure. And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
LENORE: They gave me pills to make me sleep. They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
THEO: Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life. This has gotta be some put-on
LENORE: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to do this to you.
THEO: You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
LENORE: I don't believe you.
THEO: You're the one who's not to be believed.
LENORE: My name is --
THEO: I don't want to know --
LENORE: My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
THEO: Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
LENORE: I realize you don't want to be involved.
THEO: I am not involved. Keep clicking your little wires. You'll get someone else. Good luck.
LENORE: You won't disconnect.
THEO: Oh won't I?
LENORE: Because you know you'll be killing us.
THEO: Don't lay this on me!
LENORE: Then hang up! Do it!
THEO: Why would anybody want to hurt you?
LENORE: They tortured my husband. Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts. Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
THEO: Where'd they take you to?
LENORE: I have no idea. They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows. The shutters up here are nailed shut.
THEO: Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
LENORE: No -- nothing.
THEO: Okay. The police are gonna need your full name and address.
LENORE: No! No police. They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us. They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
THEO: The cops could trace this call back to you.
LENORE: One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
THEO: What makes you say that?
LENORE: He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club. Claimed we'd run a stop sign. And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
THEO: Who?
LENORE: Elliot -- our driver. The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired. It was so quick.
THEO: Oh man. These people mean business.
LENORE: Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
THEO: Listen, there's an overpass coming up. I may lose you for a minute.
LENORE: No don't. You could lose me for good. Don't go through that tunnel.
THEO: I'm in traffic. There's no place to turn.
LENORE: Please.
THEO: Shit!
