DEHAVEN: I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that. Come work for me. I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
JORDAN: You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
DEHAVEN: I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began. And that's quite verifiable.
JORDAN: I'm sure it is.
DEHAVEN: You'll think about my offer?
JORDAN: You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it. If I spoke with him.
DEHAVEN: Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off. No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige. Don't play politics with me, little darlin'. You'd be up way past your bedtime.
