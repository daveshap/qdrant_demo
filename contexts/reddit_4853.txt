I can’t shake feeling depressed when I have no reason to be
It was a rough morning. My husband (M30) and I (F26) had a meeting this morning to get my 3 year old enrolled in an all day pre-k program for the fall, which is pretty hard to get into in my area, and it just seemed like everything that could have went wrong did. I brought our two kids to the car and my hubby forgot to grab the birth certificate we needed that I’d laid out for him to grab. We thought where we needed to go was much closer than it was so we ended up being late. And it just seemed like a lot of small irritations kept coming up as we tried to get there.

But then we did get there. And honestly? Everything went really well.  Like, we were in and out within 15 minutes and are all set to have him attend in the fall. Yet.. I’m just frustrated. My husband is wonderful, and spent the little bit of time he had before leaving for work trying really hard to help but I just can’t shake this mood even though this all happened like two hours ago. I just feel.. depressed. It’s like my mind starts feeling upset and even when the issue is resolved I can’t shake the feeling and I just don’t feel like doing anything at this point at all. I’m a stay at home mom, so I’m home with my two young kiddos, but just don’t know how to flip how I’m feeling. I guess I’m just looking for some motivation.. this isn’t the first time this has happened and generally my day ends up being pretty terrible when this does happen and I really don’t want that. I just feel stuck. Any advice?
