Is there more to life than a 9-5, 40-hour work week?
Day in and day out, go to work and go home. It seems there's no excitement anymore. I'm too mentally exhausted to do anything after work, but can't do anything before work. Five days out of seven are spent working, and in the weekends - all I want to do is stay in and do nothing, speak to no one. But I can't quit my job since I need to pay the bills and live my life, of which I have none. Is there truly more to life than a 9-5 and 40-hour workweek?
