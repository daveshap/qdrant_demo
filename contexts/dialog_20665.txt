RICHARD: No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad. Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
PEGGY: I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
RICHARD: One... two... three. You are now awake.
PEGGY: Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
RICHARD: Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
PEGGY: That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
RICHARD: I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
PEGGY: God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
RICHARD: Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
PEGGY: Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
MRS. KELCHER: You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
PEGGY: Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
