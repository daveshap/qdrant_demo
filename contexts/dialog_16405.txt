HOLLIS: Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
SAM: Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
HOLLIS: Buddy Deeds--
SAM: Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
