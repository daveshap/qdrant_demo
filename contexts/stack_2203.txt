Why do I keep getting free GTA V money from Rockstar? Is it safe to use? Every time I play GTA V on my Xbox One, Rockstar gives me $500,000. I don't play too often, and I only play about once every two weeks. This kept happening and I ended up getting a total of $4 million. I did not take advantage of this because I thought that was cheating. Anyways, I recently got onto GTA V Online and Rockstar messaged me saying not to cheat or hack and if I do, my account will get banned. I have had this account for about a year and a half now and I don't know what to do.
