GEORGE: How about you? Do you want to go?
LOVETT: Go? Where?
GEORGE: Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
LOVETT: Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
GEORGE: I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
LOVETT: Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
GEORGE: You'll wait till you rot!
LOVETT: Yes. Barney!
