I want to talk about my problems, but whenever I start to type I get mental blocked
I have no one to talk to and I want someone who I can let it all out to without bothering them but I can't seem to muster up any words.

I don't want to suffer in silence, anymore, but I'm also having a hard time finding the time to dwell on my problems. 

I feel pent up, like i'm going to explode or pass out. Trapped. If anyone has any advice on how to get the ol' complaining juices flowing I would appreciate it.
