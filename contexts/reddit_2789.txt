Is seeking therapy after being laid off from your dream job acceptable?
Going to a therapist after being laid off from my dream job

I’m feeling incredibly lost. It’s been 5 months and I’m still having issues coping with having been let go from a job I truly loved. Unfortunately in the industry I’m in, things have been tanking across the board. 

However, is it normal to go to a therapist or seek professional help to move on?
