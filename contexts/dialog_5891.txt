GITTES: Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
PALMER: Perhaps if we could meet your father.
GITTES: There's just one question.
PALMER: Of course.
GITTES: Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
PALMER: I'm sorry. We don't.
GITTES: Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
GITTES: Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
PALMER: We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
GITTES: That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
PALMER: Oh, good.
GITTES: I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
PALMER: I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
GITTES: Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
PALMER: Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
GITTES: We understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
