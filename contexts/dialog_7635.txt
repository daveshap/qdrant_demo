DONNIE: You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
GRETCHEN: What's wrong with you?
DONNIE: What do you mean?
MS. FARMER: Rose.
ROSE: Kitty...
MS. FARMER: Rose, we have a crisis. I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
ROSE: Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
MS. FARMER: Please! Don't say those words. Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
ROSE: Beg pardon?
MS. FARMER: Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
ROSE: But now you can't go.
MS. FARMER: Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
ROSE: Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
MS. FARMER: Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time. Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
