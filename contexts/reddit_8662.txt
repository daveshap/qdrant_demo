[META] How to write a successful submission for /r/NeutralPolitics (2019)
In honor of the seventh birthday of /r/NeutralPolitics, the mods have asked me, a frequent poster, to make a post addressing one of the long-standing issues with submissions: most posts don’t get approved, and a few break the rules in such a way that they can’t be fixed. 

The rules for /r/NeutralPolitics are [well laid out](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines), and /u/huadpe did a great job making a [submission-tip-list last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7u6j4f/meta_some_tips_for_composing_a_successful/), but if you’re like me, you probably don’t check the rules as you're making your post, or you do so sparingly. 

So since /u/huadpe's post is so good (really the post is very specific and quite helpful - I suggest you check it out) and the rules so well laid out, I’m going to take a slightly different and more informal approach from last year: I have 3 general tips for help organizing questions and setting your expectations.

**1: Figure out who said the thing**

Whether you heard it at work/school or read it on the internet, there’s a good chance you first came across an interesting topic as:

> “The left/right/Republicans/Democrats/scientists/ a conservative think tank/ a liberal economist, said...”

As you're laying out the background for the topic in your post, start by sourcing who introduced the topic. You don't necessarily need to give a specific name in in all cases, but I find starting with sources that correctly attribute where ideas came from helps organize the question with relevant background info. Including a source with the person who said something also tells their relative position within an organization and helps assess how serious a move or statement it is. 

**2: You're asking for explanations for things on the internet**

Don’t ask for the impossible. The thing that /r/NeutralPolitics's commenters do best is synthesize multiple internet sources to provide a coherent answer to your narrow questions, but if your question doesn't require outside sources to answer, it's in the wrong place. If a poster can't answer a question with something on the internet, you might instead be seeking speculation or pure opinion from redditors.

**3: Already approved posts offer great instructions for how to frame new topics**

The subreddit's [wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) does a great job covering the specifics of post submissions, but if you're still unsure about how to frame your question, simply look to recently approved posts. You can use approved posts to get a sense of how the subreddit's rules work in action, and then use the same language to frame your own question.

Thanks to /u/nosecohn for help with this post. We want this to be an interactive thread so please ask the mods or me any questions you may have.

Thanks!
