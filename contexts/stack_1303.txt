Adding a ground wire to old 2 wire wiring before extending to grounded wiring. I am remodeling a house and the partially unfinished attic has old ungrounded, 2 wire wiring.  There are 2 circuits.  There is a finished bedroom with one circuit on 3 walls, and a second on the 4th wall. The 2nd circuit extends out into a hallway area and then stops.  I want to extend that wiring into the other side of the attic to make another bedroom and I want it grounded.  I already fished a ground wire from the fuse box up to the end of the line on the 2nd circuit. (I cannot get it to the beginning of the line as there is a chimney and shed roof and a whole bunch of ugly over there). My question is multipart.  Can I start the ground there, or do I have to go back and ground the previous outlets on the circuit ?  (it is wood paneling, not drywall in the room, so I could take it off, albeit a big pain in the arse)  And can I try to use the same ground on the outlets of the first circuit? Do they have to be in a specific order?  Can I extend multiple grounds from one junction box?  I know I can use a GFCI at the beginning of the first circuit. But as I understand it, I cannot use them before the ground wire on the second.Sorry, this question sounds about as confused as I am right now.  Believe it or not, I rewired 2 houses.  But I gutted them to the studs, so it was easy.  And I passed inspections.
