What's the difference between Mellow Mode and Classic Mode? When you start the game, it asks if you want to choose Mellow Mode, which says \"this mode makes the game a little breezier and more relaxed\or Classic Mode, which says \"this mode is recommended for more experienced players\". What are the actual gameplay differences between the two?
