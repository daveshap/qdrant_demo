MICHAEL: My work keeps me young.
ROBERT: Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
MICHAEL: The worst serial killer in history - who? Gacy - right? Killed forty two people. Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
ROBERT: Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
MICHAEL: We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
ROBERT: Noriega is a criminal.
MICHAEL: Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S. Government. So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
ROBERT: Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
MICHAEL: I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
ROBERT: If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
GORDON: You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo? You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
RUIZ: I am a legitimate business. Fishing boats. Tuna. Check it out. Tax records, everything --
GORDON: Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
RUIZ: You can't visit me here. I want my lawyer.
GORDON: The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
CASTRO: Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.
GORDON: We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business. We got you.
GORDON: One chance here, Eduardo. Make us believe you got a boss. No boss, it's all on you.
RUIZ: It's a death sentence. I'll never make it to the trial.
GORDON: We can protect you.
