All you can do is be your best self.
That’s really all you can do. Everything else is out of your control. So be generous, be kind, be brave, text back right away if you can, show you’re interested, be interested, love and hope to be loved in return, tell your crush you like them, ask them out, wear your heart on your sleeve. All you can do is what you can control.

So do it and put your best foot out there. The worst that can happen is that you find out right away that you’re not a good fit for someone - and that’s still a great thing to know. It’s a win win situation!
