College-themed Plane Boarding Passes! [Design]
Hi A2C!  I wanted to share a fun design project I've been working on. As the title says, it's basically plane boarding passes designed in the style of different colleges.

I started this before coronavirus hit, so if you're thinking that it's a bit ironic to design plane boarding passes while colleges are kicking everyone out... you're probably right haha.

Since Ivy Day is this week, this batch of college-themed boarding passes features all of the Ivies. Hope you enjoy!
