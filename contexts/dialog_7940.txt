KATHY: Ed, I'm so happy for you.
ED: Let's get married.
KATHY: Huh?!
ED: <u>Right now</u>. Let's drive to Vegas!
KATHY: But it's pouring. And the car top is stuck!
ED: So? It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert. Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner. I promise.
