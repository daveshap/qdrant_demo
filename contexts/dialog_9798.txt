FLETCH: I'm the Sufi.
GUMMY: Fletch?
FLETCH: Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
GUMMY: What?
FLETCH: Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.
GUMMY: Why are they after you?
FLETCH: Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
