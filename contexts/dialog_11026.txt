FREDO: Goddamn bitch.
DEANNA: Relax, Freddie honey. Come dance with me.
FREDO: Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here. Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
DEANNA: I hate to see you cringe in front of him. How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
FREDO: He's the head of the family.
