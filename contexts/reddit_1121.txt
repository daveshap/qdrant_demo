anyone constantly running conversations with other people through their heads?
so I feel as if i’m an awkward person. I’m not the best at carrying conversation. bad at bringing up topics to talk about. so most of the time i just ramble nonsense during conversations. and i feel as if i sound ridiculous. 


then i sit there. hours later running the conversation through my head. why’d i say this? or why’d i say that? these people must think i’m a weirdo. i could have done this or that differently and maybe they’d think i was normal. 

my mind never stops. sigh.
