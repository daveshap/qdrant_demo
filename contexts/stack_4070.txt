Where do I apply for Schengen Visa? I'll be travelling to Europe from 30th May to 13th June. I plan on reaching Vienna on the morning of 30th and leaving for Prague on 2nd July. From there, I'll travel to Krakow on 5th July. From there on 8th July, I'll leave for Bratislava. And from Bratislava to Budapest on 10th July. I'll leave Budapest on 13th July. Since my time of staying in each country is almost the same, should I apply at the Austrian Embassy since they'll be my point of entry? Also, I haven't purchased tickets for flights yet. Is it necessary or just giving the itinerary of flights I plan to use work? I came across websites offering flight reservations for a nominal fee. Should I use that?
