NICKY: ...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
NICKY: But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
MARINO: Yeah, but they're complaining.
NICKY: Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
NICKY: I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
MARINO: It's up to you.
NICKY: They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.
