CO-PILOT: Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
PILOT: I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
CO-PILOT: Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
PILOT: Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
CO-PILOT: I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
PILOT: I'll bet it's a fortune.
