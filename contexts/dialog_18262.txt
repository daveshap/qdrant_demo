RONNY: Loretta. What's that smell?
LORETTA: I'm making you a steak.
RONNY: You don't have to help me.
LORETTA: I know that. I do what I want.
RONNY: I like it well done.
LORETTA: You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
RONNY: This is good. Uhh...
LORETTA: Loretta.
RONNY: Where'd Johnny find you?
LORETTA: He knew my husband who died.
RONNY: How'd he die?
LORETTA: Bus hit him.
RONNY: Fast.
LORETTA: Instantaneous.
RONNY: When you get engaged?
LORETTA: Yesterday.
RONNY: Why?
LORETTA: Why what?
RONNY: I don't know.
LORETTA: So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
RONNY: No.
LORETTA: Stupid.
RONNY: When your husband get hit by the bus?
LORETTA: Seven years ago.
RONNY: How many men since then?
LORETTA: Just Johnny.
RONNY: Stupid yourself.
LORETTA: No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
RONNY: I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
LORETTA: What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
RONNY: Why you talking to me?
LORETTA: You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
RONNY: She was right to leave me.
LORETTA: You think so?
RONNY: Yes.
LORETTA: You really are stupid, you know that.
RONNY: You don't know nothing about it.
LORETTA: I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't. She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
RONNY: I'm a wolf?
LORETTA: The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away. So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free. Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
RONNY: What are you doing!
LORETTA: I'm telling you your life!
RONNY: Stop it!
LORETTA: No!
RONNY: Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
LORETTA: Because I have no Luck!
RONNY: He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
LORETTA: I am looking where I should to become a bride!
RONNY: A bride without a head!
LORETTA: A wolf without a foot!
