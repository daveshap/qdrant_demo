INIGO: Sir. Sir.
MIRACLE MAX: Hah?
INIGO: We're really in a terrible rush.
MIRACLE MAX: Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
INIGO: Sixty-five.
MIRACLE MAX: Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 93.
INIGO: This is noble, sir. His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
MIRACLE MAX: Are you a rotten liar.
INIGO: I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
MIRACLE MAX: Your first story was better. Where's that bellows? He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
INIGO: He's dead. He can't talk.
MIRACLE MAX: Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
MIRACLE MAX: Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
INIGO: What's that?
