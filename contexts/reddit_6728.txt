Do recruiters send you to interviews knowing you don't have a chance?
I got a couple interviews through a recruiter who told me something interesting.  He said the company told them to send four candidates, but they didn't intend to submit four rockstars - they would send two of their best candidates, and two fillers, to make the best candidates look better.

He assured me I wasn't one of the fillers, but I assume he'd say the same thing to the fillers themselves, so for all I know I was one of those.  Made it to a second interview though, so who knows.

Does anyone else have any experience with this situation?
