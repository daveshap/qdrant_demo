Is this election an [almost] perfect storm for a perfect a third party candidate? Or at least record-breaking voting for a third party candidate.
I do not expect a third party, namely libertarian, to actually win, but it has occurred to me with both parties having record unusually high unfavorability of the presumptive nominees, and many unexpected things happening during the election, is it possible given the environment for a third party candidate to swoop in and take a substantial number of votes, based on general election results from the past of similar election year conditions (if those exist?)

Some quick sources for perceived unfavorability:

The Libertarian Party seems to be the "strongest" in terms of ability to do this, with even in the past, arguably less "crazy" election, their nominee, Gary Johnson, [clinched 1% (1 million) of the popular vote](http://reason.com/blog/2012/11/07/gary-johnson-pulls-one-million-votes-one). This is of course insignificant, and it's wild to think they could get something like 35% of the national vote, but is it possible for them to garner 5-10% from this odd election, given how other elections have played out with third parties in less favorable conditions?

I'm aware that our system is set up to stop third parties as much as possible, but this is also an unique election, at least as of in recent memory.
