HAGEN: Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
PENTANGELI: Did my brother go back?
HAGEN: Yeah, but don't worry.
PENTANGELI: He's ten times tougher than me, my brother. He's old-fashioned.
HAGEN: Yeah. He wouldn't even go out to dinner. Just wanted to go home.
PENTANGELI: That's my brother. Nothing could get him away from that two mule town. He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
HAGEN: You're right.
PENTANGELI: Tom, what do I do now?
HAGEN: Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history. I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43. We were young then.
PENTANGELI: Yeah, I still read a lot. They bring me stuff.
HAGEN: You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
PENTANGELI: Yeah, it worked. Those were great old days. We was like the Roman Empire. The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
HAGEN: Yeah, it was once.
HAGEN: The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
PENTANGELI: Yeah, but only the rich guys. The little guys got knocked off. If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
HAGEN: Yeah, that was a good break. A nice deal.
