I want to get a job working with Math, but have a degree in criminal justice, how could I do it?
In my last year of college I took Chemistry, statistics, and Pre-calculus for my gen eds. I fell in love with stats and really fell in love with math. I graduated with my degree in Criminal Justice and feel stuck, I don't want to work in this field. I've researched jobs such as Data analyst, Accountant, Statistician, and financial planner. But the requirements are all "Finance, Business, Computer science, ect." A far cry from my degree. Is there any way to pivot and get a job working in the field of math?
