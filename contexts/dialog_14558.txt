HENDRICKS: Chief?
BRODY: In here.
HENDRICKS: I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
BRODY: You didn't miss much. Christ, what a mess.
HENDRICKS: Positive I.D.?
BRODY: The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
HENDRICKS: Oh.
BRODY: What about that camera?
HENDRICKS: What camera?
BRODY: That one -- from the wreck. You brought it up, did you look inside it?
BRODY: Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing. Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
HENDRICKS: If there is, develop it!
BRODY: You got it.
HENDRICKS: I know just where to go.
BRODY: Not the drugstore!
HENDRICKS: Of course not, They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me.
BRODY: The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it?
HENDRICKS: Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
BRODY: Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
BRODY: Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
HENDRICKS: Right.
ELLEN: Thank you. I'll tell him.
BRODY: For me?
ELLEN: Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
BRODY: Damn.
MIKE: Is Hooper coming to dinner?
BRODY: Not till next year.
BRODY: Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
ELLEN: Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you?
BRODY: Santos' place.
BRODY: Oww!
ELLEN: Careful. What's wrong?
BRODY: Nothing.
ELLEN: Nothing, huh?
BRODY: That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
ELLEN: Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'?
BRODY: Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
ELLEN: Oh. Want to talk about it?
BRODY: No.
ELLEN: Terrific.
BRODY: Michael.
MIKE: Yeah?
BRODY: You want to come here a minute?
SEAN: Hi Dad.
BRODY: Hiya yourself.
