FREDDY: I beg your pardon?
IGOR: There wolf! There castle!
FREDDY: Why are you talking like that?
IGOR: I thought you wanted to.
FREDDY: No.
IGOR: Suit yourself...I'm easy. Better watch out for the wockers.
FREDDY: What wockers?
IGOR: The wockers with the knockers.
FREDDY: Wockers with the knockers???
IGOR: Go ahead, play dumb! You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
