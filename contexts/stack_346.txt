How do I get 2 Dell monitors to work with my MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2017, Two Thunderbolt 3 ports) OSX doesn't support MST daisy chaining monitors. I've got 2 brand new monitors and a decent mac and Apple wont let me use it due to software limitations.Is there any product I can buy (Amazon preferably) that will let me use my two monitors (not screen mirroring) as I want to? I can plug both displays into the mac but then I can't charge the mac at the same time or close the lid without it going off. Dell U2518D are the displays.
