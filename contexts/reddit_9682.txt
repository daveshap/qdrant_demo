SA Pros - Has Anyone Participated in an Accreditation Visit?
Hi! I've polled the /r/highereducation group about their experiences with accreditation visits at their respective institutions. 

My school's accreditation visit is coming up in 2 years, so I'm curious to hear how it is at other places. Specifically, I'm curious about what the roles look like for SA professionals. 

Any feedback is appreciated. Hope everyone is enjoying the summer! :)
