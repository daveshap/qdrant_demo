KIRK: Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
SPOCK: Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
KIRK: I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
SPOCK: Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours.
KIRK: That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
SPOCK: Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
KIRK: But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
SPOCK: You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
KIRK: You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
SPOCK: I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well. Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
KIRK: I would not presume to debate you.
SPOCK: That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
KIRK: Or the one.
