It feels kind of strange looking good with someone in a photo
The guy I’ve been dating suggested on a recent date that we should get a photo together.

Holy shit it’s a nice photo. I’m surprised how good we look together. I don’t think I ever looked that fitting with my exes. I keep looking at the photo and am just amazed how well it looks like we fit together. 

I don’t know what that means but I wanted to share.
