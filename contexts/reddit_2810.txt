Should you apply for a job even if you don't have *every* qualification?
I did a lot of hiring and firing in one of my previous jobs, and one thing that we'd do on our job requisitions is list a bunch of technologies that people "should know". But, that didn't mean that the candidate needed to know \*every\* technology. We sorta meant it more along the lines of "some" to "most", but definitely not none.   


Here's my attempt at providing some career guidance this week: Don't let job requisitions scare you if they list stuff that you may not have any direct experience with. That said, definitely be honest with yourself. Don't apply for a position that you know that you aren't qualified for. You're wasting your time as well as the time of our interviewers. But, do not let a long list of requirements necessarily dissuade you from applying for a position that you honestly believe you could add value to.   


The worst that happens is you don't get the position. But, you also get practice tailoring your resume to the job opportunity (yes, tailoring your resume is important) and, if you're called into an interview, you also get to practice your interviewing skills - something that I've found a LOT of people need a LOT of help with.   


tl;dr career advice: Apply for any position that you honestly feel qualified for and don't get scared off if you don't meet every one of the requirements.
