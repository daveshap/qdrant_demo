Hiring First Startup Employee
Hey all. First time posting here and hoping to get some direction.  


I am the co-founder of an insurance technology company based in Evanston, IL (smaller city just north of Chicago). Me and the other co-founders have spent nearly 2 years working on this company and are getting ready for our public launch mid March. We've had a lot of success so far pre-launch; we hit our seed round fundraising goals and have all our tech in place for launch. Now we are looking to add our first full time employee in inbound sales.  


We want someone who will be our boots on the ground working side by side with all the co-founders to build a customer base. We also want someone who will eventually transition to senior management  one day and run the entire sales department. I think of this person as being relatively young, highly motivated, and with prior sales experience.  


Any ideas on the best places to hunt for this type of talent? We've posted on indeed, but we've been getting SO many CVs that don't fit the bill. Thanks in advance for any help! Oh and if this sounds like you, and you live locally, please feel free to introduce yourself :-)
