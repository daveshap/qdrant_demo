I haven't hurt myself since September
I don't know who else to share this with. Very few people in my life even know about my propensity for self harm. I've been doing it for 6 years now starting when I was 18. Nothing major predominately on my legs and chest, at my lowest point I was doing it multiple times a week. It's been 3 months officially today since I last did it. It's the longer I've gone since I was 19 or 20. I feel some hope that maybe I'm finally getting better but like I said only 2 people in my life even know and both are reluctant to talk about it and I'm hesitant to talk about this with them because I don't think they would understand why I'm proud of myself for 3 months abstention. I know nobody will probably read this but God I wanted to share it. Sorry this is such a rambling mess.
