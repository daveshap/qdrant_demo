Unemployed and unmotivated?
So I (23F) just graduated college with a bachelors in sociology. I was just going to go pretty much for the sake of my parents pleasing my parents and them not letting me take a gap year while in school, so I had no time to figure out  what I wanted to do before graduating. I gave it some thought over the summer and realized I want to be a family/marriage therapist and have to go back to school but I don’t want to rush just yet because I needed a mental break because I was really depressed those 5 years in college.
In June I was applying to just retail jobs, got a few interviews and didn’t come out with a job. Now I’m in august and I stopped applying entirely since mid July after I had to go to the hospital. I lost all my motivation and was just looking for something part time until I can actually do my career job. I don’t know how to get out of this slump. I really do enjoy fashion and want to work retail but I feel either overqualified or under qualified for having no retail experience. I don’t know if it being summer makes it the worst time to look as well. I’ve had a couple of summer jobs as a camp counselor and a few assistant jobs in college. I will say I don’t follow up after applying to jobs I just wait. I’m contemplating applying to seasonal jobs so I can attempt to have some form of income but I can’t even get myself to do that. So far I’ve been looking at retail and assistant/receptionist jobs but this month is look kinda slow. What should I do?
