Thanks to this sub, I finally learned to take the high road and be honest….
45/F here.  In the past year I haven’t had any action in the dating scene other than a couple bad & brief first dates.  Lately I’ve been feeling like it’s time to “scratch that itch,” as they say, so I turned to Tinder for help.  It’s not something I normally do, but what can I say; sometimes a girl has needs. And Tinder delivered!  Got matched with a very good-looking guy, my age, no red flags in his profile or our texts.  We decide pretty quickly to meet up soon, rather than text endlessly.  

&#x200B;

So we meet up tonight for a drink at a bar near my place.  He looks like his photos and is very sweet, there's instant chemistry, the conversation is flowing.  Before long we’re making out.  I bring him home to my place and things get hot and heavy. For a little while, I’m a happy girl.  But then…

&#x200B;

In the middle of us having sex, he says – and may I just stress here that this is our first date – “I love you so much.”  I don’t reply, and he says it again.  

&#x200B;

Me: “You do know this is our first date, right?”

Him: “I know, but come on, say it back.  It’s just words, it would be so hot to hear you say it back.”

Me:  “Nope.  Not saying it.”

Him:  “But it’s just words.”

Me, shaking my head vigorously as my desire begins evaporating: “NOPE.  I’m not saying that.”

&#x200B;

Suddenly things aren’t so fun anymore.  I’ve been with this type before – the love bomber, or whatever they’re called.  He’s also saying things like “You’re just what I was looking for,” and “I’m so glad we met, I really want a girlfriend again” etc. etc.  Alarms are going off in my head and I’m having instant PTSD from all the previous similar guys I’ve met.  They flood you with affection and say all the things they think you want to hear on the first date, and before you know it, you’re being stalked or emotionally abused or they want to move in together after two weeks.

&#x200B;

NOPE NOPE NOPE.  Bye bye desire.  But he’s still in my damn bed, saying he wants to "do me all night."  So I say I need to go to the bathroom, and I leave the room to go sit on my couch. 

&#x200B;

Even though I already know what I need to do, I log on to r/dating for a boost of confidence.  I read similar posts about all of your frustrations, and your awesome advice to each other.  I know I need to tell him this isn’t going to work. 

&#x200B;

After a while he comes into the living room, confused as to why I left the bed.  At first I say, “oh I’m just catching up on my work emails.”  He tries to kiss me and I resist.  He says, “So… do you want me to leave?”  

&#x200B;

I take a deep breath and explain that I think we’re looking for different things, I was only looking for a night of fun, but not anything more serious than that.  He takes it very well and says “oh okay that’s cool, I’ll get dressed and leave.”  And he does.  He says while walking out, “Hey let me know if you ever want more fun.”  I say I will, but I won’t.

&#x200B;

So I did it.  Instead of lying there all night, watching the clock, agonizing over what the morning will be like, what to do next, feeling bad about not liking him when he likes me (yep that was the old me) etc. etc... I just bit the bullet and was honest.  And it feels good.  

&#x200B;

So, thank you Reddit.  It took me a long time to gather up this kind of courage, but it sure feels good to be up front and express how I feel to a guy.  And to not lead them on, for fear of hurting them.  I know now that it’s ultimately more hurtful to disillusion them.  Or ghost them.  

&#x200B;

Sleep well, everyone!  I know I will.  

&#x200B;

TL/DR:  Met a guy online, he wanted something more serious than I did.  I got up the courage to be honest and tell him how I feel right away, rather than lead him on or ghost him.  He took it well and I feel so relieved.
