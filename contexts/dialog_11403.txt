MR. ROBINSON: Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
BEN: Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
MR. ROBINSON: That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
BEN: I will.
MR. ROBINSON: Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
MRS. BRADDOCK: Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
BEN: Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
