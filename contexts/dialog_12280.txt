HEATHER CHANDLER: You stupid cunt!
VERONICA: You goddamn bitch!
HEATHER CHANDLER: You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
VERONICA: Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
HEATHER CHANDLER: Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
J.D.: Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
VERONICA: S'okay....
J.D.: I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
