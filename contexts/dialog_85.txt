MARCHENA: How can you be so certain? The Ocean is said to be infinite.
COLUMBUS: Ignorance! I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.

MARCHENA: Esdras is a Jew.

MARCHENA: Two minutes... and already you're a dead man. Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
COLUMBUS: I'll try to remember that, Marchena...

MARCHENA: You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
COLUMBUS: I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
MARCHENA: Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
