LINDA: -- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
DR. LANDON: I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
LINDA: I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do? Then What?
DR. LANDON: Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you. They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
LINDA: He has Phil right now.
DR. LANDON: Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
LINDA: Yeah.
DR. LANDON: If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
LINDA: -- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
DR. LANDON: We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
LINDA: I'm listening. I'm getting better.
DR. LANDON: Do you wanna sit down?
LINDA: I need to sit down.
DR. LANDON: Ok. Linda: Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is. He is dying very, very rapidly --
