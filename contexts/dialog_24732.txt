CAMILLE: Well, how did you like the class, David?
DAVID LEE: It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
DAVID LEE: ... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'! Why was that, Miss Johnson?
CAMILLE: Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
DAVID LEE: Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
CAMILLE: You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
DAVID LEE: He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
CAMILLE: You could? How?
DAVID LEE: I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me... You wanna hear another story?!
CAMILLE: Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
CAMILLE: What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
DAVID LEE: My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
CAMILLE: You think about your father a lot, don't you?
DAVID LEE: Yes mam...
CAMILLE: Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
DAVID LEE: What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
CAMILLE: But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
DAVID LEE: But where is my daddy!?
CAMILLE: I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father. Come on, tell me...
DAVID LEE: Nothin'...
CAMILLE: And so you did your job, right?
DAVID LEE: Yes, mam...
CAMILLE: Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
DAVID LEE: What do that mean?
CAMILLE: Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
