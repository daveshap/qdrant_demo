Fat shamed by someone you just occassionaly meet
So, this happened today. I know this guy but not as close that we can be labeled as friends just constantly fat shamed me in my face in front of some acquaintances and friends. So what I did was just ignore him the first few minutes but then I figured out it did not stop him from insulting me saying things like my face is so round and fat and that my sister is way more prettier than me and etc. And i felt so frustrated that I want to just slap him in the face. 

Then I just snapped and jokingly say I don't need his presence and walk away. It stopped him for a while, thanks to my friends who knew that I was getting frustrated they took his attention away from me. 

Reflecting, on what I did earlier made me realize that I should've handled it with respect since he triples my age but acts like a child.

What should I say the next time this happens?
Thanks.
