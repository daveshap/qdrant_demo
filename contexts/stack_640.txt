Ping6 routing between interfaces failing Spent the last two weeks googling every IPv6 gateway and routing example and none seem quite like this. I have three machines setup in the following configuration:Machine A has IP of 2001:cdda:2011::1 on dev eth0.Machine B has IP of 2001:cdda:2011::2 on dev eth0, 2001:cdda:2012::2 on dev eth1, and has all forwarding configured to 1.Machine C has IP of 2001:cdda:2012::3 on dev eth1.Ping6 from Machine A to Machine B, IP 2001:cdda:2011::2 works.Ping6 from Machine B to Machine C, IP 2001:cdda:2012::3 works.Ping6 from Machine C to Machine A, IP 2001:cdda:2011::1 fails. If I manually configure the route on Machine A telling it how to get to Machine C it works, but I am attempting to setup a mobile network where the route from A to C and vice versa is not static therefore I cannot preconfigure this route.Essentially I am restricted from using pre-defined routes or default routes, as the hop from A to B may not be there at all times. (There will always be a router on device ETH0 with access to Machine C via ETH1, it just won't always be Machine B). Does anybody have insight on how to do this?Respectfully, Riley
