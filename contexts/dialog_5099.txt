CRASH: Nuke...tell me something. Did you hit me with your right or your left?
NUKE: My right.
CRASH: Good. Good. That's terrific...
NUKE: What?
CRASH: If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand. ya might get injured. That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
