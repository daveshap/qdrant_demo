ELLIS: ...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway. Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
BELL: When did he die?
ELLIS: Nineteen zero and nine.
BELL: No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
ELLIS: Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'. Diggin' in that hard caliche.
ELLIS: ...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
BELL: Most don't.
ELLIS: You're discouraged.
BELL: I'm... discouraged.
ELLIS: You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
