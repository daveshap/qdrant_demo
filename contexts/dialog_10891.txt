ROYCE: So why're you even considering it? Are you?
JORDAN: Just like you would be.
ROYCE: Spec-Recon. Those guys are world- class warriors. And they will not want you there, Jordan.
JORDAN: I take it you don't either. Feet.
ROYCE: Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
JORDAN: Royce. We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
ROYCE: She's haze grey and underway...
JORDAN: You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits. I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
ROYCE: So dump on me.
JORDAN: This has nothing to do with you.
ROYCE: Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
JORDAN: Get your dick back here. It has everything to do with you.
ROYCE: You're such a ball-breaker sometimes. Especially at night.
JORDAN: Sorry. But after our days... So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
ROYCE: I'll try to keep the door open. If you wash out, I make it so that --
JORDAN: Wai', wait. What happens if it works? Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
ROYCE: I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan. Maybe we should just let it happen.
JORDAN: Which is guy-speak for...
ROYCE: Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth. But I'm trying to be honest, okay? Three years is a long time. Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know. And either do you.
JORDAN: You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
ROYCE: Jordan...
JORDAN: Thank you, Royce. It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
