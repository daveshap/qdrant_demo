I have a Predicament
Okay... I'll make it simple. I've been dating my girlfriend (we'll call her Jahna) for 8 months now, and I love her very much. Buttt my darned brain is screwing me up. It's insisting on keeping a crush on this girl (we'll call her Cassidy) that I liked before I started dating my girlfriend. Any advice?
