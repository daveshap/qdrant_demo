Well r/teenagers, it’s been a fun ride. After today I will officially be 20 years old. To celebrate the milestone, here’s 20 bits of advice I wish I had when I had just become a teenager (turning 13)
1. Being a teenager is hard as fuck; you find yourself in a state of flux where almost nobody will relate at all to you, whether they’re young or old. *This is okay.*

2. It’s gonna take a while for you to find who you really are. You probably won’t start settling on a solid persona until you hit 16-18.

3. What seems permanent right now is most likely just a phase, even though you said how much it really is you forever now.

4. That doesn’t mean resist what you want to do because it’s just a phase. Embrace the weird stuff. Listen to death metal. Watch anime. Paint your nails. Wear crazy neon colors that don’t match. Do it. And take lots of pictures when you do. It’ll be hilarious later.

5. Talk to your crush. Ask her out. It’s okay to be nervous, just don’t be weird.

6. It helps if you get to know her as a person a little bit before making your move, and at least make it *seem* like you have a sense of self-respect. Clean up after yourself, look/smell clean, and for fuck’s sake, don’t seem like you’re desperate.

7. **Make some goddamn friends.** It absolutely sucks to look back on most of your high school experience and realize that all you did was play video games, watch anime, and jerk off the entire time. All that will do is make you feel depressed and worthless. (You’re still gonna feel that way regardless, but at least you’ll have someone to talk about it with)

8. Find some people that you can relate to. If you’re a nerd who likes to talk about anime, science, and video games, try talking to the quiet kid or something.

9. Sit in the *back of every fucking class*. If you’re lucky you can snack, use your phone, and draw dicks on the table all year without the teacher noticing.

10. In a few years. you’re either gonna find a lot of formerly cool shit right to be cringy as fuck, or you’re going to *be* cringy as fuck. Try to be the first one.

11. Learn to laugh at your cringeworthy moments, and learn from your true mistakes.

12. Talk to the janitor. Learn his/her name. Use it.

13. Talk to the security guards. Find out which ones are the cool ones. Trust me, I’ve gotten out of *so much shit* just because I had a security guard cover my ass.

14. Join clubs. If you don’t like them, don’t go, but at least try a few and see if you can get involved. Same goes with after-school activities.

15. If you’re gonna fuck, **get some fucking protection.**

16. If you’re gonna smoke weed, **get some fucking snacks, and do it with people that you like.**

17. If you’re not primarily focused on academics, getting a part-time job to earn some cash is literally one of the best things you can do while still in school.

18. That doesn’t mean “get all ‘C’s and work at McDonalds”. Your academics are important and your performance in school should be a priority.

19. Getting a license and a car is **SO FUCKING WORTH IT.** Your world opens up like ten times over when you suddenly have the capability to drive anywhere you want to go. If you’re the guy/girl with a ride, it’s super easy to cement yourself as the “pack leader” for your friend group. Plus it’s going to set you up for success after you graduate.

20. More than anything, live life how you really want, on your terms. Don’t bottle yourself up and hide who you really are. You’re a special, one-of-a-kind human being and there won’t ever be another person like you ever again. You are made up of the essence of a thousand dying stars, and you have that same power to light up the world with what potential you have. Use it wisely.

And with that, r/teenagers, I bid you farewell. I hope you all have an excellent 6 years of confusion.
