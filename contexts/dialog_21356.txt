UTAH: I'm not armed.
BODHI: But you're not alone.
UTAH: Good guess. There's a gun on you right now.
UTAH: Where's Roach?
BODHI: Around somewhere. Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U. What can I do for you?
UTAH: You gotta tell me where she is.
BODHI: And let my policy expire? Sorry.
UTAH: Look, Bodhi man. People are dead. The ride is over.
BODHI: I say when it's over!
UTAH: The guy you killed was an off duty cop! If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land. They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
