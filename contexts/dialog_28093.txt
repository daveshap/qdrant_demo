LOMBARD: What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
MRS SPITZ: You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
LOMBARD: How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
MRS SPITZ: Do what, Mr Lombard?
LOMBARD: Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
MRS SPITZ: I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
LOMBARD: I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
MRS SPITZ: Then you should not have sought an explanation.
LOMBARD: I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
MRS SPITZ: Yesterday. It all looked normal.
LOMBARD: Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
MRS SPITZ: Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
LOMBARD: So he could have decided to go on a trip...
MRS SPITZ: He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
LOMBARD: Then why aren’t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
