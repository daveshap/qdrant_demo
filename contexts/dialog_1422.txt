JESSE: Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
FRANK: Jim was old enough...
JESSE: He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
FRANK: Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
JESSE: You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
FRANK: Yeah.
JESSE: A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
FRANK: I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
COLE: We'll make them pay for this.
JESSE: I'm out.
COLE: WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
JESSE: Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
