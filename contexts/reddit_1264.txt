Ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of evil in the world?
I'm a bit of a history buff, and I made the mistake of watching some documentaries on the fascists of the early 20th century recently. Naturally they discussed things like the Holocaust, the Red Terror, and other atrocities of that era.  That shit really gets to me, and lately I've found myself being overly sensitive to every terrible thing on the news as a result.  A college girl goes missing, a boy is murdered by his step-dad, etc; you get the drift.  It can be a little over whelming sometimes.  I just don't understand how human beings are capable of doing such horrible things to one another.

Does anyone else struggle to process this stuff, and how do you deal with it?

**EDIT: I've been reading all of your comments for the last day, and I just wanted to thank everyone.  You tend to *assume* people feel the same way you do on common sense issues like this, but actually seeing individual responses and everyone's different ways of coping is very therapeutic.  It's nice to know I'm not alone.**
