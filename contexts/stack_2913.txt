Cosmological redshift : \"time of emission\" vs \"during travel\" Let\u2019s consider a very distant galaxy, suppose it has no peculiar velocity, and let\u2019s assume space expansion; If I understand correctly there would be a redshift due to the value of space expansion at the  time when photons were emitted from this galaxy, then there would be a redshift due to space expansion (and its possible variations) all along the travel in space and time of these photons toward our present point of observation. How do these two redshift values compare? Is the first one negligible compared to the second one?
