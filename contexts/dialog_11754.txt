ANNIE: What?
TOM: You ever just stand still for a minute?
ANNIE: You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger. You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
ANNIE: That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
TOM: Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
ANNIE: It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
TOM: Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
ANNIE: Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
TOM: What's that to miss?
ANNIE: Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
TOM: Does Chicago count?
ANNIE: You lived in Chicago?
TOM: When I was first married.
ANNIE: You were married to a woman in Chicago?
TOM: I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time. You seem surprised?
ANNIE: Well, I, uh... you didn't...
TOM: Just who's been laughing at who here?
