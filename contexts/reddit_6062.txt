Rude hiring process?
I had 3 interviews with a great position in my dream field, and then flew out to meet everyone at the company - before the pandemic.  When I flew out, I was told the decision was between me and someone else, and the decision would be made before the end of the week.  Unfortunately, that was the week everything shut down, and the company emailed me telling me they would need some extra time because they had their plates full with covid-stuff.  Completely understandable.  Three weeks later they got back to me and said they were freezing their hiring process for the time being due to things being crazy, but would be in touch once everything started to settle down.  I responded that I was still very interested in the position, and asked if they knew which direction they wanted to go (I just graduated college, and needed to know whether to move back home to wait for the position or sign a new lease on my apt.)  They never responded to that question.  Now, about 4-5 weeks later, they called and said that things are looking clearer, and they would like to make me an offer.  I did not think this was a big deal, but a lot of my friends and family have been telling me that this behavior was incredibly rude, and they have strung me along.  With the virus impacting pretty much everything, I’m not sure if they were being rude or just incredibly busy.  I’m pretty new to the career-world so is this rude or acceptable?  Is it a red flag that they didn’t let me know they were looking to hire me specifically after things opened back up?
