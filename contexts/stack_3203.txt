During the Imperial Period how were the Butlerian Prescriptions Enforced.? There are plenty of references in the Dune books about meeting the requirements imposed by the Butlerian Prescriptions, but very little about how they are enforced. Examples:A Richesian inventor makes a device, it goes through some kind of    review, it may be deemed legal on Richese but not elsewhere. A world outside the Imperium becomes  technologically advanced. Who goes out and surveys the world's technology and demands the Landsraad and Emperor take action if they are no longer adhering to the prescriptions?The Prescriptions:Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a Human Mind.Thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit the Human Body.Thou shalt not make a machine capable of propagation or regeneration.
