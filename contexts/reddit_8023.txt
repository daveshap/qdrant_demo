Can I ask an employer to give me a salary instead of a tuition waiver? (probably a stupid question)
Edit: yo guys I'm well aware this isn't the best question, downvoting doesn't help ðŸ™ƒ

I know this is probably dependent on the university, but most of the people on my university subreddit are undergrads so I can't ask there

When I was admitted, I was awarded a tuition waiver by my department. Part of the stipulation of the waiver is that if I get a waiver-generating appointment, the department waiver would be void. Because of this, I've just been applying to part-time jobs instead of graduate assistant positions. I applied to this part-time job I really liked a few days ago but I'm preparing my backups just in case I don't get this part-time job.

I looked at the assistantship job board again and saw one that's still posted that I think I'm qualified for. However, they award a tuition waiver. Say I apply to this assistantship and I get it, would it be ludicrous to ask the employer to give me a salary in lieu of a tuition waiver since I don't need a tuition waiver? I just want something that'll help me offset the cost of rent and groceries ðŸ˜­ again sorry if this is a stupid question, I'm first generation and my only friends that are in grad school are first-years like me, so they wouldn't know the answer to this
