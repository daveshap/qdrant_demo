Got out of bed and went to class!
Spent the past few days in a hangover induced,  severe spiral inwards and downwards; today I resided to the fact it was a “stay in bed, I can’t face the world” day.  Figured I’d just do some work for assignments from bed....I knew I wouldn’t. 

So forced myself to get up. And I’m currently at the bus stop on my way to class. 

It’s the little things. 

Hey I just got my bus ride for free  yay.
