NANCY: M'god, I look twenty years old. You have any weird dreams last night?
GLEN: Slept like a rock.
NANCY: Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off. You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
GLEN: No.
NANCY: You believe in the Boogey Man?
GLEN: One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
NANCY: You believe in anything?
GLEN: I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
NANCY: Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
GLEN: Uh-oh...
NANCY: It's nothing too hard or anything. I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
NANCY: Okay?
GLEN: Okay, okay. I think.
