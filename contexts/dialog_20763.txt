WHEELER: We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
ANDREW: Honesty is always best.
SEIDMAN: Do you really think so, Andy?
ANDREW: Yes, Bob, I do. Excuse me? Am I being fired?
WHEELER: Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
JOE: In a word, yes.
WHEELER: We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world.
WHEELER: And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
JOE: But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
WHEELER: ... we've got a committee meeting.
ANDREW: Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
KENTON: Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
WHEELER: Take it easy, Walter.
ANDREW: If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
WHEELER: I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
ANDREW: A carrot?!
JOE: I buy that.
ANDREW: As in, the vegetable?
