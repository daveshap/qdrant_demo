POPPY: She's working as fast as she can, Icarus. It will be ready soon.
ARGON: It's ready now, I know it is.
POPPY: She says it's not.
ARGON: She's lying. She lost the first one on purpose.
POPPY: She did not. The mouse ran down the drain.
ARGON: She let it escape because she wants me to die.
POPPY: Don't be a child, Icarus. She is just another scientist and like all scientists, she doesn't care about anything outside the world of the laboratory.
