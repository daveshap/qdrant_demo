ON/OFF strobing multiple high-power LEDs (500mA+) Goal: I have an application requiring strobing of many (30+) individually addressable, high-power (500mA+) LEDs. Each LED sequentially will be switched ON/OFF at a rate of about 10Hz, switching from one LED to the next in sequence at a rate of about 100Hz. Full ON/OFF would be sufficient, but some means of dimming would be nice.I have three main ideas about how to implement this: A constant-current buck driver (e.g. PicoBuck).A linear voltage regulator / MOSFET approach.A high-amp constant-current driver chip. I have been looking through the Texas Instruments driver catalogues, but I haven't found any multi-channel LED drivers with similar functionality above about 120mA output per channel. So I may need to use a single-channel driver like the TL4242. But if I need to use many single-channel constant-current drivers, how would I go about synchronising them? Could I \"drive these drivers\" with some daisy chained TLC59711 drivers or similar? Is this even vaguely sensible?Is there an obvious chip choice or implementation that I haven't spotted? I'm fine with having a few dozen chips on a breadboard/PCB, if that's the most sensible way to do it.Thanks
