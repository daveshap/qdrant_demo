Is it ever appropriate to ask for a day off during your training period?
I just got a job in the bakery department of my local grocery store. The store's training period lasts 6 weeks. I have a doctors appointment this week (that I can't reschedule), and I am 3 weeks into training. My manager has me scheduled to work alone the day of the appointment, which means my department will be vacant for an hour. I have to take a 30 minute (unpaid) lunch break, and I'm thinking about talking to my manager to see if she would extend that break (which I am allowed to do, according to the handbook). Is that appropriate, or would trying to trade the shift or even asking for the entire day off be better?
