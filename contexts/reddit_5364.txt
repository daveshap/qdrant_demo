Found a job but it’s in a call center and It sucks
I have never worked for a long time because my parents used to tell me how they could pay for my things and that I should focus on studying, I was careless but just until a few years I realized I needed to find a job to contribute to society. I found a call center job  but:

1. The trainer in my call center is treating us like slaves, wanting us to do homework after our shift ends and then requesting presentations for the next day, leaving us no time to rest.

2. Management is constantly threatening us to fire us if we mess it up, I don’t even want to make a mistake because I don’t know the consequences.

3. I don’t socialize with my coworkers, I find them very vulgar and the type of person who likes gossip and I’m just not like that, I’m also not used to people who doesn’t respect diversity and I find myself alone, I don’t talk to people here apart from the hi and bye.

4. I need the paycheck for my things and so I don’t have to rely on my parents anymore. I want to be free but with my parents help that’s almost impossible. I felt miserable without a job and now that I have it...I feel I’m in a very negative environment. 

What can I do to last long and gain experience? I want my parents to know I’m determined to be independent and also be disciplined and be a good worker.  

TL;DR: I found a job in a call centre but management or anyone above agents treats us like slaves and there’s no other job I can find that pays like a call centre in Central America. What can I do to survive, gain experience and not suck?
