CASE: Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
ARMITAGE: You see the couple up in the balcony?
ARMITAGE: That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
CASE: He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
ARMITAGE: Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
CASE: The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
ARMITAGE: Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
MOLLY: A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
ARMITAGE: He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
