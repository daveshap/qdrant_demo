JOE: Get it while you're young. And you better fix your lips. You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
JERRY: It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
JOE: So? It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire. That's life. You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
JERRY: What are you giving me with the omelette?
JOE: Nag, nag, nag. Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
JERRY: Joe -
JOE: What?
