I did it.
After 4 years and 2 weeks of crippling suicidal thoughts, I called to make an appointment for an initial consultation at my university's clinical services. I'm scared for tomorrow, but it's the only thing I'm holding on to at this point

*** Oh wow, the support is overwhelming. Thank you so much, everyone. I'll update again tomorrow after the appointment.
