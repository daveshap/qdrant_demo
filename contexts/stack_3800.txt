Can Principal Component Analysis explain variation in social data due to other factors? I have a set of social data for 30 countries. The data is in the form of percentage change in answers to a survey question, asked at two points in time (i.e. UK showed 20% increase in positive answers to Q1). There are around 30 countries.I hope to use PCA to determine how much of the variation seen in the social data is explained by other factors - specifically Human Development Index, Happiness index and ecological footprint.Is PCA the best way to get my answer? If so, when I plug the data in, do I include the original social data? I've tried that but the first component is always explained 100% by the variation in that data set.Any help would be greatly appreciated.
