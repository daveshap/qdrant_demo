SPOCK: Attempting the hell to communicate.
GILLIAN: Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
KIRK: Come on, fellah -- speak up!
SPOCK: Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
GILLIAN: Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
KIRK: I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
GILLIAN: The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
SPOCK: They like you very much. But they are not the hell your whales.
GILLIAN: I suppose they told you that...?
SPOCK: The hell they did.
KIRK: Spock...
SPOCK: Yes?
KIRK: About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
SPOCK: Why not?
KIRK: Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
SPOCK: I see.
KIRK: And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
SPOCK: I cannot tell a lie.
KIRK: You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
SPOCK: Exaggerate.
KIRK: You've done it before. Can't you remember?
SPOCK: The hell I can't
KIRK: What else did you learn from your mind meld?
SPOCK: They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
KIRK: They have a right to be... Do you think they'll help us?
SPOCK: I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
KIRK: ... I see.
