DOROTHY: Oh, Andy.
ANDY: Don't cry.
DOROTHY: I can't help it. You don't know.....
ANDY: Darling, you can't go through any more of this. Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
DOROTHY: I can't.
ANDY: You've got to get your mind off this.
DOROTHY: You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
ANDY: Go!
DOROTHY: And don't ever try to see me again.
ANDY: What are you talking about?
DOROTHY: Please! You can't get mixed up in this.
ANDY: Do you think I care
DOROTHY: You don't understand. You don't know what's going to happen.
ANDY: I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
DOROTHY: I can't marry you! I can't ever marry you!
ANDY: Dorothy!
DOROTHY: How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children? It'd be fun, wouldn't it? Maybe they'd murder each other... keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done. He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
ANDY: You're talking like a crazy person,
DOROTHY: Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
ANDY: Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you. Don't you understand that? I love you.
DOROTHY: Go away!
