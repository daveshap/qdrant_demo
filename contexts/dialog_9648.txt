ANNE: Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
JACK: You still believe in God?
ANNE: Oh sure... Gotta believe in God. But I don't think God made man in his own image. No. 'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men. No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>Booooorring</u>!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out... ... Not that we have to get married.
JACK: ... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
ANNE: Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
