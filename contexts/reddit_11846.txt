[Modpost] On the policy of reposts.
Hey guys. It was recently brought to my attention that some threads might not get any responses, and if they are allowed to be reposted. The answer to that is, of course, **yes**! Obviously, as more people start joining the subreddit, more posts get pushed to the bottom, but we here in /r/whatsbotheringyou feel that everyone deserves an answer, and that your problems should be acknowledged. If your post doesn't get any comments on it, by all means, feel free to post it again.

**BUT**, in doing this, please do us a couple of favors. Firstly, please **delete the original**. We'd like to avoid the clutter, and removing the unnecessary copy saves us a lot of the work. Secondly, only repost if nobody responds, or if the responds are just trolling.

Thanks for reading, thanks for sharing your problems, and thanks for being there when others need you. You guys are great, and I hope to see you around.

Thanks,

The1RGood
