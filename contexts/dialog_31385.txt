GRADY: Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
JAMES LEER: I had to. Didn't I?
GRADY: Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
JAMES LEER: No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
GRADY: Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
JAMES LEER: Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
GRADY: He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
