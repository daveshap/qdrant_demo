FISHER: My God...
MOORE: He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading Atlas Shrugged
FISHER: Did he try to kiss you?
MOORE: All week long.
FISHER: He kept saying he was protected.
LIZ: What does that mean?
FISHER: Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
LIZ: Like how?

LIZ: The only proof is those bodies.
FISHER: So what do we do?
LIZ: Move the bodies.
FISHER: Move the bodies?
