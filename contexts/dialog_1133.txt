MADAME WEBER: Let us pass, please! Let us pass at once! We're with the Emperor.
FLUNKY: I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
MADAME WEBER: Do you know who I am? This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
FLUNKY: I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
MADAME WEBER: Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
