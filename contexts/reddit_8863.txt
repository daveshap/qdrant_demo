Regarding criminal justice reform, what are the differences between the policies supported by Democrats and Republicans? Is there a viable balance between their approaches?
President Trump recently signed the [First Step Act](https://www.jurist.org/news/2018/12/president-trump-signs-criminal-justice-reform-first-step-act-into-law/) for criminal justice reform. Some Republican-led states with high inmate populations, like Texas and [Louisiana](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/spotlight/2017/04/14/prison-louisiana-policing-the-usa/100432314/), have also initiated reform.

In Democrat-led states, proposals focus heavily on rehabilitation. One example is a [plan for prison reform from Hawaii](https://www.courts.state.hi.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/HCR-85_task_force_final_report.pdf). Excerpts:

"Evidence...confirms that the rehabilitative approach is the only sustainable way to make our communities safe," p. iii

"Hawai‘i should transition from a punitive to a rehabilitative correctional system," p. xiv

"Hawai‘i’s Correctional System Should Incorporate Key Elements of the Norwegian/European Correctional Model," p. 11

The [Norway model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_Norway). (It should be noted that Norway has only 5.2 million people, is not very multicultural, and has a highly educated population. Its people are pretty amendable to its criminal justice model.)

An article on the [Norway corrections model](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/18/prisonsandprobation-norway)  offers some interesting comments:

>"...two of the leading lights of European prison reform....reflect on what has allowed Norway to keep its prison population low and to generate such public support for this approach. Christie suggests that having a functioning welfare state has done a great deal, for this makes it difficult to create "social distance", so that each person feels connected to everyone else and therefore no one gets scapegoated for the troubles that occur."

Can the Norway model of criminal justice be applied to the US? Is there the political will to advance the U.S. welfare state enough to effectively implement something like the Norway model?

Overall, what are the major differences between the policy proposals of the two major parties related to criminal justice reform? Given that state governments and the Federal government are divided between those parties, what's a model of criminal justice reform that suits both of them?
