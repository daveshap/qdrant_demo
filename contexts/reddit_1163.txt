Just one bad interaction can ruin my day. Anyone else?
It can be simple stuff but like the title says one bad interaction with someone can ruin my day. Example, Going out with my brother to a mall, we both suffer from Anxiety, his social anxiety been way worse than mine and all of the sudden we have some employee following us around and checking on us like we are going to steal something. Idk if they judge us for the clothes i wear or because i dnt look people in the eyes, most of the time i even wear earphones cause i dnt want people talking to me. Anyways my brother gets mad and say "WTF he is following us for?" And even if they don't say anything back for that moment on my brain just keep replaying that moment the rest of the day. Or been in the drive thru and asking for stuff and getting the wrong items or missing something over and over same thing happens, my brain just keep thinking about that situation. It gets annoying cause i can be having the best day and all of the sudden something like that happens and there goes my day. Anyone? Leave your story in the comments below.
