Has anyone lost all drive in their career (and life) due to a highly mundane job? Did you get it back once moving on?
My current job is very dull and inefficient, with simple tasks taking all day due to outdated processes. I have tried to address this but the bureaucracy makes this near impossible.

I've found this is really getting to me and I've just lost interest in attempting anything and am now doubting my own abilities. Worryingly this seems to be bleeding into my own hobbies and goals.

Has anyone else been in this scenario? Did changing jobs help?
