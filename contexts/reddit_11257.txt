I'll never confide in anyone anymore
First, I apologize if the text is unclear at some parts but English is not my native language. Lately I've been feeling horrible. There is nothing I can enjoy anymore, I have a brain fog, etc. I told this to my father bc I thought I could trust him but I was wrong. He made a really big deal about what I said to him and told everyone in our family about it. He started yelling at me and telling me that I have nothing to be depressed about and blamed everything on my friends and mobile phone. Now there is a chaos in my house again and everything is my fault. I just wish I never said anything and I don't think I'll ever be able to confide in anyone anymore.
