HAN: Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said! I tell you this time it's not my fault. I'm sure I checked it.
LEIA: No lightspeed?
HAN: It's not my fault. I can't under- stand it!
THREEPIO: Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
LEIA: Well, what now?
HAN: Sharp bank, Chewie. Let's turn this bucket around. You heard me, turn around! Full power on the front shield.
LEIA: You're going to attack them?!!!
