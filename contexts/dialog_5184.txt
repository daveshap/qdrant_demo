LASZLO: No, Captain, please.
RENAULT: No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.

RENAULT: Sam?
ILSA: Yes.
RENAULT: He came from Paris with Rick.
ILSA: Rick? Who's he?
RENAULT: Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
