DR. GILL: -- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest. Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
ISRAEL: That's not possible. I told you.
DR. GILL: There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
ISRAEL: Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
DR. GILL: No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
ISRAEL: -- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
