Determining the acceleration of the Universe from a single star? It Occurs to me we might be able to find an entirely independent method of determining the Universe's acceleration using a single source.If one was to watch a single high source consistently one should be able to simply simply watch for the change in it's redshift with time. I know it would be a small effect (perhaps choosing a high Z source would help).Is such a task feasable? Maybe something like finding a source that could line up with the recoiless resonant absorption (Mossbauer effect) in some crystal would have enough sensitivity? (ie a cosmological scale Pound Rebka experiment)??Anyway, I hadn't heard of it, but maybe someone can tell me why its a bad/good idea. Thanks!NOTE: I get that ultimately one would use several sources for a proper analysis.
