LARRY: Who's there?
KIRSTY: Daddy?
LARRY: Kirsty?
KIRSTY: I got through.
LARRY: Where are you?
KIRSTY: I found a room.
LARRY: What did you say?
KIRSTY: I said: I found a room.
LARRY: I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
KIRSTY: No Dad.
LARRY: You'd like the house.
KIRSTY: YOU'D like my room.
LARRY: Do you want me to come over?
LARRY: Well I want you to see the house.
KIRSTY: I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
KIRSTY: Great.
LARRY: Well come over, will you? See the place?
KIRSTY: Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
LARRY: What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
KIRSTY: It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
LARRY: I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
KIRSTY: I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
LARRY: You will keep in touch.
KIRSTY: Of course. Every day.
LARRY: O.K.
KIRSTY: Take care, Dad.
LARRY: Call me tomorrow.
KIRSTY: I will. See you.
LARRY: Well?
JULIA: Why not?
LARRY: We'll move in Sunday.
