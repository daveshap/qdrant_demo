Why do friends always leave me alone after a while??
    I have had groups of friends that I’ve been friends for years, but after a while they always happen to leave me alone and not wanting to hangout with me. This has happen to me twice. I’ve really haven’t had a friend who will want to talk to me and actually will be my friend. I know that people can change and it just makes me feel worse about myself. Since I probably have a low self esteem. 
    Like the first time it happened to me, they all pretended that I wasn’t there and flat out just left me like nothing had happened. While the second one, they all changed and stopped texting me like I’m the one who is starting the conversation and it’s just not right for me to do all the work. 
     The main issue is that I don’t get why people don’t want to be friends with me. I’m a really sweet person who just want someone to talk to and I will do the same back to you. I’ve had dealt with a ton of people leaving me behind or just left from being friends with me. I feel like I have dealt with too many and I don’t understanding why.
