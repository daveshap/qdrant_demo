PA: Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
GRAMPA: And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do. And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California! This here's my country. I b'long *here*. It ain't no good-- --but it's mine.
TOM: Ma. Pa. Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
GRAMPA: And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
TOM: Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.
PA: Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self. Reckon we could git him *drunk*?
TOM: Ain't no whisky, is they?
MA: Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here. It put the chillun to sleep.
TOM: Don't taste bad.
MA: And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
TOM: That's right. And douse some in it.
