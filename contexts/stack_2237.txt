Which units are most effective at destroying buildings? In Halo Wars (1) I use to enjoy a good hit&amp;run tactic on an enemy base early in the game to destroy their generator(s) with cyclops's.In Halo Wars 2, cyclops's are more anti-tank units then building destroyers.Which units are the best to take down buildings for both UNSC and Banished?
