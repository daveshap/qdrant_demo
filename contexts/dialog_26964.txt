NICHOLAS: How did those... ?
CONRAD: You're part of it...
NICHOLAS: What? Connie...
CONRAD: No! You're one of them. Of course, it makes perfect sense!
NICHOLAS: No, it doesn't! Those keys were put there. I didn't even know...
CONRAD: You're behind this, aren't you? You and your sick friends. Well, make it stop!
NICHOLAS: Listen to yourself. Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
CONRAD: Because you hate me. Because you had to be here, when mom died. Because you had to do it alone. Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too. I'd have been here...
NICHOLAS: Stop this. It's not true...
CONRAD: I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry! How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
NICHOLAS: Stop it!
