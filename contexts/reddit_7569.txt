I want to become a genetic engineer. What master's should I pursue?
So as the title states, I want to become a genetic engineer. I plan on getting a BS in either biotechnology or bioengineering (my state does not offer any degrees in Genetics). Where do I go from here? I don't plan on getting a Ph.D. because I don't think that's my thing and I'm not sure how I would do in that program if I wasn't 100% invested. That being said, I'm hoping a solid master's degree can get me where I need to go. What do you guys suggest?
