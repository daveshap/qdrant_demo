HEYWARD: Where do we go from here?
HAWKEYE: We don't.
HEYWARD: I don't understand!
HAWKEYE: This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
HEYWARD: Then what?
HAWKEYE: Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
HEYWARD: And if we're unlucky?
HAWKEYE: You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
HEYWARD: Any powder?
HAWKEYE: : Only one or two loads.
CORA: Are we safe?
HAWKEYE: Maybe...
CORA: Our father? Did you see my father?
