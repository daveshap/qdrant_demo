Is there a colloquial word/phrase for data that can not be used to show a quality of an object? Let's say I've not shown up for my linear algebra class for four months. I now have to cram for the final in the last two days, which we can say is stressful. Now, this could not be used as evidence to show that the class is difficult.How would I describe that? I could say \"That's your fault, me, -not evidence that can be used to ascribe a quality to a class-.\" How would I restate the content in the --?I think \"That's your fault, you can't take that to mean the class is difficult\" is pretty close, but I think there may be a better way to say it.Thank you!
