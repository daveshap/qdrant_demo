The website tomahawk-player.org maybe has an expired certificate. Should I ignore that? I have an iMac running High Sierra 10.13.6. I wanted to download the Tomahawk music player from the developer site at www.tomahawk-player.org. Safari tells me the connection is not private. It appears their certificate expired 99 days ago. This seems like a long time for that to go on without the owners of the website upgrading their certificate. I just want to know if I should ignore this warning. I'm very hesitant to go there.
