Does anyone else’s anxiety affect the way they communicate?
I always feel like I’m too much and that my ideas don’t matter. In turn this causes me to be timid in the way I talk and mumble I guess? I can’t communicate my ideas clearly or confidently which causes confusion in everyone. I just push my ideas aside and turns out I was right the whole time and I end up punishing myself.

It’s really affecting my work as well.
