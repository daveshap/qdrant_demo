DOM: Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
TED: No.
DOM: Why's that?
TED: I'm usually too tired to be.
DOM: Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
TED: Huh.
DOM: The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
TED: Jesus Christ you're right.
DOM: You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
TED: Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
DOM: People get hurt that way.
TED: Hey.
MARY: Hi, Ted.
TED: You look great.
MARY: Thanks.
MARY: What's that?
TED: Hm?
MARY: On your ear, you've got something.
