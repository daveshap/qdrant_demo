CHARLEY: Working hard?
TERRY: It's a living.
CHARLEY: You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
TERRY: I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
CHARLEY: We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
TERRY: Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
CHARLEY: Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
TERRY: But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
CHARLEY: Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with. When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.
