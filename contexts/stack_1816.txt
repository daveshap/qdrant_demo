\"We choose each other as partners\" or \"as a partner\" [plural or singular] My fiancee and I are drafting our wedding contract.  There are many things it's important to get right in such a document, and grammar should hopefully be among the easier ones.One portion of a sentence in the draft contract currently reads:\"we choose each other as partners for all life's journeys\"Is \"as partners\" (plural) grammatical?  I see an argument for \"as a partner\" (because we're choosing only one partner), but for reasons I'm having trouble articulating, that formulation (with \"partner\" in the singular) sounds funny to me.One way to resolve this would be: \"We each choose the other as a partner...\"  That one very clearly sounds right only when \"partner\" is singular.  But the overall phrasing seems clunky, so I'd prefer not to use that sort of formulation.
