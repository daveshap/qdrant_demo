Can we divide a vector by another vector? How about this: $a = vdv/dx?$ My physics teacher told us that we can\u2019t divide vectors, that vector division has no physical meaning or significance. How about this: $$a = vdv/dx.$$ It says acceleration vector equals velocity (as a function of $x$) times $dv$ \u2018divided\u2019 by $dx$. Here both $dv$ and $dx$ are vectors. How do I make sense of it? Because vector division doesn\u2019t exist in physics right?
