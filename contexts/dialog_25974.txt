ANNABELLE: In high school.
RACHEL: He'll be impressed. The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
RACHEL: The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
ANNABELLE: But Rache...
RACHEL: A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!
