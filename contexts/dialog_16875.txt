SHORTY: I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
MALCOLM: It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
SHORTY: Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
MALCOLM: The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
SHORTY: Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
MALCOLM: I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
SHORTY: You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
MALCOLM: How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
SHORTY: Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
