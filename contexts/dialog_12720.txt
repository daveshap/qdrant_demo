KAHN: Spare a chair?
TAUPIN: Kahn?
KAHN: Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
TAUPIN: Sit.
TAUPIN: How are you?
KAHN: Head still secure to the neck.
TAUPIN: How did you find me?
KAHN: How many places this side of the Atlantic serve lager and lime?
KAHN: Old habits die hard. Waitress! A round of Nitzhic! Peasant drool, I know. But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
TAUPIN: What are you doing here?
KAHN: It is the gathering, my friend. The settling of old scores.
TAUPIN: And have you something to settle with me?
KAHN: Not tonight. Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
TAUPIN: It's good to see you, Kahn.
