BILL: Hello, Tom.
DICKSON: You here again? What do you want?
BILL: What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
DICKSON: Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
BILL: I want to know why .
DICKSON: Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
JANITOR: I haven't any.
DICKSON: You haven't got a uniform?
JANITOR: No, sir.
DICKSON: My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
JANITOR: Why, I don't know.
DICKSON: You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.

DICKSON: Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
MRS. PEMBROKE: Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
DICKSON: Got my letter?

DICKSON: Hello, Helen.
HELEN: Good morning.
DICKSON: Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
HELEN: I don't know.

HELEN: Why - well, I—
DICKSON: Ummm. Stalling, eh? Anything new?
HELEN: Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
DICKSON: Directors, eh? Long faces?
HELEN: Longer.
DICKSON: I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
MRS. PEMBROKE: Mr. Dickson?
DICKSON: Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
