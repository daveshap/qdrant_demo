What did Snoke mean when he said that Kylo Ren was \"unbalanced\"? During the speech when he's chastising and demoralizing Kylo, Snoke says that he is immature. I'm not sure of the exact wording, but he definitely uses the term \"unbalanced\" to describe Kylo. He says that he was hoping for a new Vader, but that Kylo is weak and unbalanced.Snoke could mean one of two things here. Does he mean that Kylo is unbalanced, as in crazy, deranged, and irrational? Or does he mean that Kylo is unbalanced in the Force, somehow having an inner discord between the Light and the Dark?
