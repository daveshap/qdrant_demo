Invert Voltage 0-2V I need to invert voltage from the one sensor.So the ting is that I have DC signal from sensor:0%-100% range of 0V-2VI need:0%-100% range of 2V-0VI have LM324 level indicator and it is showing opposite value, I can not connect opposite inputs on LM because circuit board is done.Any idea how to do it as simple as possible?It is a simple one measuring device, 10 input channels - OP amps, working on a 12V. OP amp is comparing common input signal (0V-2V) and each OP has its own referral voltage. Only case is that it is working opposite showing full tank when is is empty and vice versa. So I need to figure out how to invert voltage from the sensor as i mention above... supply is same for sensor and device 12VDC, and it is common (-), otherwise it would be possible with few resistors
