NIXON: Thank you, Fidel Castro.
PAT: You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
NIXON: I sure am. The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy. And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
PAT: I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
NIXON: Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear. They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
