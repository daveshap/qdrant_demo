How long before you are truly invested?
There is no textbook answer for this, but one thing I have noticed a trend in this sub is people who are still just starting out in a relationship (6 months in or under) and questioning red flags from their BF/GF.

In my opinion, and this comes only from my personal experience and observations of others is that if you are still within a year of getting together, you are still learning about who the other person is. Even if you feel that beautiful deep connection in your soul (Which I truly believe in), this other person is still a stranger to you. You are learning who they are, which is part of the beautiful game of dating and of life. 

&#x200B;

You don't owe a stranger your mental and emotional health. If you see a red flag, feel the strength to take a step back and say to yourself, "I have only been with this person a few months and this is what they are showing me as who they are. Is this who I want to be with?"

Listen to your gut and don't think you owe anyone anything over your own health and safety.
