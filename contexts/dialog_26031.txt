MAX: See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
LENNY: Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
MAX: An ex-cop that doesn't carry. It's embarrassing. I oughta not be seen with you. Hey, Mace. What's goin' on?
MACE: Greetings, gents. So let's hear this week's sad story.
LENNY: They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it? I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately. Have you noticed?
MACE: No. I haven't noticed because I make my payments. So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
MAX: Sucks. Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
