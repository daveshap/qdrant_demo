Accepted a job offer from HR dept, should I email my manager before I start my job?
Maybe I'm overthinking this:
I attended interview 2-3 weeks ago and received both a verbal and written offer from HR agent, which I've accepted a week ago. I'm scheduled to start Oct 21. I also started the onboarding process (paperwork, company portal, etc). Should I trust that HR has notified my manager or should I contact/email him directly? I'm just paranoid that I haven't spoken to my manager since the interview, which was about 3 weeks ago. I'm planning on sending an email next week but don't know what to write. Help?
