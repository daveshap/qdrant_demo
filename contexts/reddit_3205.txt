Company now expects me to work overtime despite receiving a 25% pay cut due to COVID-19 and never receiving any sort of overtime pay, how should I proceed?
Hello all, as for some more context: I currently work a standard 9-5 job where I work on a salaried basis (ie receive no overtime and/or commission). Due to the COVID-19, everyone's salary was reduced by 25%. However, our CEO is expecting us to work overtime, particularly overtime after 5 pm. How should I proceed if there is little to no incentive to work overtime due to the factors mentioned above?
