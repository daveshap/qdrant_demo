A single word describing a piece of literature that contains many figures of speech I'm looking for a positive word. A word that describes a writer and/or a piece of their work... which has the quality of being densely packed with impressive uses of literary devices.Example sentence:He tends to like authors that are ..........He only appreciates songs if the lyrics are .........The word I'm looking for doesn't necessarily have to be applicable to both the sentences above. Either one will do. A single word is ideal, but a short phrase would be acceptable.Once again, I wish to reiterate that I'm looking for a positive word. I realize that this style of writing has its critics and there are words which could be used to attack its over-the-top nature. But I want to describe it as a good thing. So anything with primarily negative connotations is out.
