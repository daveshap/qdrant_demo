Welcome To My Virtual Thanksgiving
To everyone who is hiding to avoid the people in your house, everyone who is trapped where they are, everyone who is alone, Happy Thanksgiving.

It's okay to hide. It's okay to take care of yourself. You can still be a part of something. You can celebrate the way you want to. You can celebrate here, with me. 

Where we can hide in our rooms and have our episodes and get through this day together.


Come and join me. I'll be here all day!




Edit: It's seven hours later but don't worry. My virtual door is still open. No one is late to my Thanksgiving, we just move at our own pace! You are always welcome here!
