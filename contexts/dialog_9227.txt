GRANT: That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
MICHAELS: I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
CORA: Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
DUVAL: Dr. Michaels is right. We have no choice.
MICHAELS: Tell them to take us out.
GRANT: If there's any chance --
MICHAELS: Request removal, Mr. Grant.
REID: But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
CARTER: No...
CARTER: We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
REID: But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
CARTER: Not until the very last second. We must think of something... Something to save the situation.
