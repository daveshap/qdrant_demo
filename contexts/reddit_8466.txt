Question about "globalism" vs Right Wing populism
I've been a little bit confused by the sort of new growing philosophy of the right the past year with things like Brexit, the alt right and Trump- and I'm not trying to pass this off in a judging way.

From what I take it these movements are based on nations regaining a sort of national identity against sort of expansive free trade deals/global alliances like NAFTA or the EU, and this expands into a skepticism of multiculturalism and allowing possibly anti-western cultures like radical Islam from seeping in to Europe or America (I.e refugee crisis).

Now I understand this at a basic level but I guess I don't really get how much of this is conspiratorial vs just a philosophy? What exactly is the main fear of so called globalism?

I've seen a lot of people suggest "globalists" like Hilary Clinton and George Soros are trying to push things like open borders to push toward a one world government and supression of traditional cultural identities, is there actually documented proof that's the deliberate motive behind something like NAFTA or Merkel allowing a million refugees into Germany? (This seems more conspiratorial...http://mobile.wnd.com/2016/12/globalism-and-islam-an-unholy-alliance/)

Or is it a more pragmatic concern, that people want a more isolationist approach because they are genuinely worried about the economic downsides of the TPP or whatever? Was there studies showing Britain leaving the EU was a good decision?

I just find it interesting because it's new political paradigm for me, I'm used to the 2000s when I thought of punk rock Anarcho communists being sort of the lead truther/anti government people, and now it seems it's shifted to sort of the right being "anti elitist"
