I quit my job because I couldn't keep (unknowingly) scamming people and I need to know if I have any (legal) course of action options to help this company stop what it's doing to innocent people?
I quit my job a week ago when I got fed up with being lied to and my co-workers and I found out all the "helpful" products we were selling to innocent people turned out to be what I would call a "scam" but is really just deceitful- the Energy service ends up costing double the kWh, never sent the "giftcards", were putting people in debt- and the "home automation" service they just acquired touts itself as the "number 1 in safety" (I can't find evidence of this anywhere) that binds people into a 5 year contract in which they have to pay thousands of dollars to get out of; plus they do door-to-door sales and their product is one of the worst reviewed things I've ever seen.

 I quit because I couldn't sell these to people anymore, as well as the treatment of my managers towards me and my co-workers, (sexual harassment), and the fact that the company operates as a Pyramid Scheme in which you "level up" after training your team of newly-hired, fresh and naive college students to get a number of points (whether that means selling based on lies/cancellations or not) and then you eventually get promoted to "Team Leader", but not before being manipulated by the top people taking it away from you because you didn't show up to work 30 minutes early. Long story short, the "promotions" lead to nothing but more work.

THREE- yes THREE different "trainers" were arrested with FELONY CHARGES during the course of my 4-month stay with that company for selling fraudulent phones, etc. It sucks because literally everyone did fraud there, that was the ONLY way to get promoted and keep getting "$1,000 paYchEckS" every week.


I apologize for the rant but it was just terrible and I would like to know if anything can be done about this, what course of action I could take (besides the detailed, bad review I left, which is of course buried by the hundreds of fake, glowing reviews on Glassdoor). Please let me know, thank you.
