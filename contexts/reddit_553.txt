What I realized today...
Tomorrow will be the absolute worst Valentines day of my life. Last year this time I was in a perfectly solid relationship.... In the months following things went downhill, mostly because I found someone whom I thought I liked more that my partner. I ended up doing many horrible things and now neither of the two women want anything to do with me. I learned my lesson and I'll never make the mistake again but there's still a part of me that wont give it up. Every day is a living hell. I don't know where I stand anymore in life. Please fellow redditors, help me out. I need some advice on how to cope with Valentines Day tomorrow and how to move on with my damn life.
