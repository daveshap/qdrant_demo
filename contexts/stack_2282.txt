Does the game auto-selects the tuning profile in NFSU2? In Need for Speed Underground 2, one can tune the car's characteristics. But upon entering the tuning screen, one needs to choose among several 'profiles', i.e., Circuit, Drag, Drift, StreetX, and URL.My question: Does the game auto-selects which profile to use when entering a race? Or must I first go to, say the garage, and manually choose the profile to use prior to finding &amp; entering a race?
