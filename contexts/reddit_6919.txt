Any advice for my father (60M) that recently got laid off from his factory job after 25 years?
My dad just recently lost his job that he’s been working at for the past 25 years. He did metal working in a steel plant that has now gone bankrupt. 

He’s asking for advice on what he should do next. He doesn’t have skills really. Has poor computer literacy. No degree or education past high school. He feels like he’s too old to go to school for it to be worth anything. 

He ultimately doesn’t think that he would completely retire, he has too much energy to sit around the house. 

I’m not sure what to tell him or what advice to give.
