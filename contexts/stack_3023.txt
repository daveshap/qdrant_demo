Why is -273.15 \u00b0C the low temperature limit for the universe? According to Ideal Gas Law the lowest  temperature of an ideal gas can be $-273.15 \u00b0C$. This temperature is also considered the lowest temperature in the universe. But it is the lowest possible temperature for ideal gases. What is the proof that it is the lowest possible temperature for real gases and more importantly for all things in the universe?
