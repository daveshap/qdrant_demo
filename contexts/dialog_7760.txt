LLOYD: You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
HARRY: That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
LLOYD: Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
HARRY: Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep. HARRY Dunne.
LLOYD: No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
HARRY: Probably because we've never met.
LLOYD: No, that's not it. Anyway - LLOYD Christmas.
HARRY: Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
LLOYD: I haven't seen you around here before.
HARRY: Home school. Til today.
LLOYD: Home school? What's that?
HARRY: I go to school where I live.
LLOYD: Me too!
HARRY: I think it's just over there.
LLOYD: Is that what I think it is?
HARRY: No, it's a treasure map.
LLOYD: Cool.
HARRY: My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
LLOYD: I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that X". But... I do know something."
HARRY: What?
LLOYD: You're it.
