PEGGY: Hi, Richard.
RICHARD: What are you doing?
PEGGY: Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
RICHARD: That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
PEGGY: Yep. It's going to be a law. I broke up with Charlie last night.
RICHARD: That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
PEGGY: It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
RICHARD: Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
PEGGY: For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
RICHARD: Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
PEGGY: Like what?
RICHARD: Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
PEGGY: What do you know about hypnosis?
RICHARD: Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
PEGGY: Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
RICHARD: No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
RICHARD: You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three. We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
PEGGY: Peggy Sue Kelcher. Or, Peggy Bodell. I'm not sure.
RICHARD: Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
PEGGY: Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
RICHARD: What will they be made of?
PEGGY: I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
RICHARD: Silicon is from sand.
PEGGY: We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
RICHARD: In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
PEGGY: No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
RICHARD: You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
PEGGY: No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
RICHARD: Will you take of f your blouse?
PEGGY: Yes, every day. Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
