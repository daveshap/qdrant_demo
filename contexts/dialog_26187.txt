PONY: Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while" Chorus here. "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be""
SOOZE: That was so great!
ERICA: It's coming along.
PONY: Thank you.
BUFF: Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
PONY: Hey, thanks, man.
JEFF: So who are you?
PONY: What do you mean?
JEFF: Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
PONY: I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
JEFF: Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
PONY: What?
JEFF: Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
PONY: Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
JEFF: Of course it does.
SOOZE: You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
PONY: Mine too.
JEFF: W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
PONY: You know what I'm saying?
SOOZE: Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
BUFF: Wait, what happened to the tree?
JEFF: Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
SOOZE: Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
JEFF: No, I don't.
SOOZE: Yes, you do.
JEFF: No, I don't.
SOOZE: You do.
JEFF: No, I don't.

ERICA: Thinks he is. Well, he is.
TIM: He is?
ERICA: Yes.
TIM: He is.
ERICA: He is.
TIM: And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
