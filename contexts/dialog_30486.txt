WALLACE: To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
REILLY: As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
WALLACE: As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you. ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
REILLY: Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
WALLACE: Do they have to look so...robotic?
REILLY: At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
LINDENMEYER: All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
SID 6.7: True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
LINDENMEYER: It was you, wasn't it?
SID 6.7: It was me, what?
LINDENMEYER: You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you? You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
SID 6.7: I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
LINDENMEYER: My God...
SID 6.7: Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you? In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
LINDENMEYER: What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
SID 6.7: I had something a little different in mind. Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
