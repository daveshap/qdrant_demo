Do you make the federal minimum wage? If so, I'd love to talk
The federal minimum wage is still $7.25. If you're currently being paid $7.25/hour, I'd love to find out how you make it work--do you have multiple jobs? What's your budget look like? I'm a reporter and I'm working on an article(s) focusing on how truly difficult life is when living on a federal minimum wage.
