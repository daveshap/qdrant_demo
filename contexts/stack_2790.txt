Creating sympathetic resonance in a guitar string with an electromagnet I have an idea for a potential new type of reverb and I wanted to know if it was possible/practical.The idea is to have an electromagnet in the middle of a guitar string(s) which will hopefully cause the strings to vibrate. The vibrations would then be captured by a pickup at some other harmonic point along the string. I suppose that the tautness of the string would determine the necessary strength of the electromagnet so I was thinking that the strings would need to be tuned octaves below my desired resonant frequencies. This is because it seems like it would be easier to cause the string to vibrate at a frequency further up the harmonic series from its fundamental frequency due to the smaller distance that the string would need to travel...I suppose this question isn't very clear. Ummm... Questions:Does the strength of the magnetic force exerted on the strings depend on voltage or amperage, or both? Is it feasible with 9V and 100mW?How would I even begin to calculate the amount of electromagnetic energy required to start a string vibrating?Is it more feasible to have an inductor and a permanent magnet and physically connect it to the string, i.e., take apart a speaker and tie the cone to a string?If a body is made to resonate at harmonic frequencies will these smaller vibrations eventually combine to cause the body to vibrate at its fundamental, e.g., if the string is tuned to C3 and I create vibrations at C4, C5, and G5, will it eventually start vibrating at C3? i.e., do harmonics work in reverse?
