Being stood up can actually save the night!
I (31M) have been stood up tonight - the person I was suppose to be seeing never showed up. Second time this has happened in the last six months! On both occasions, however, being stood up was a blessing. On the first one, the venue was showing an NFL match (quite rare in London). At present, I have an opportunity to enjoy good food and good wine on my own, without having an awkward conversation. Dating still sucks, but looking at the bright side!
