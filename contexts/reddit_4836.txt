Terrible heavy physical pain in my chest when I’m sad. Tips to make it go away?
I have not been diagnosed with depression or anything I’m not sure if I have to have been before I make a post here but I’m out of options. I am 2 types of medication that have side effects including depression,anxiety etc all the bad stuff. 

I’ve never got this feeling before I went on them so I know it’s the meds. I tried coming off then and everything stayed the same so I think I’m stuck feeling like this now

Usually something triggers me and I get an awful pain in my chest that I would describe as just so painful and terrible. It’s not an organ pain or something I know it’s a mental one. The only way I’ve figured out to get rid of it was s***h**** but in trying to stop. Does anyone experience this or have tips in general to get rid of it??

Sorry if this does not have enough info, this is my first post here I’m in desperate need of advice or help. It’s getting worse by the day and I will try anything. 


Thank you
