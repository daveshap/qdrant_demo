Does anyone else get super sensitive to noise when they’re anxious?
Whenever I’m feeling really anxious my hearing seems super sensitive and sounds/voices can be overwhelming. When I get like this I get super irritated by people talking and loud noises. Does this happen to anyone else? Sometimes it gets to the point where I want to put in headphones to drown out the noises I can’t control.
