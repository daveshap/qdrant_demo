Grad school or gap year(s)? [long post]
Hi everyone. (this is going to be a long post and I sincerely apologize for this)

Last time I posted about needing some advice about potential grad school options [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/studentaffairs/comments/5in04c/possible_sa_grad_student_need_your_advice/), and some of the comments have been helpful.

So my decision, after talking to my parents and some professors/supervisors about it, was to go ahead with the offer from Rochester (for their Educational Administration w/ concentration in SA and Academic/Career Advising), but deferring my enrollment to January 2018 instead of the original August 2017.

Reasons for deferral:

* 1) I will be graduating in mid-May, and would be returning home sometime in early June (after getting all my things sorted with the lease and the phone/internet plans and all that. Rochester's program would have me attending orientation in mid-August. I plan to come to Rochester at least a week earlier to settle in & everything, so that would have me returning to the US in early August.

So that leaves me with less than two months to rest at home, and after four years of leaving my country to study in the US (& only going home for the summers), I don't think it would be enough. & my grandmothers would definitely be mad if I'm only home for a little while.

* 2) With what's going on after the inauguration and everything, my parents are a little worried about me staying in the US, so they want to see how things are going to be in the next couple of months and see if it gets better/worse.

* 3) Funding wise. Currently parents are supporting my brother on his master's in Scotland, and he would be finishing in Sept/October. Thought it would be better to let him finish first before they start worrying about funding my master's program (since I would at least be on personal funding for the first few months at least while I try to get an assistantship/job).

However, I am also currently looking at opportunities to work in Malaysia in the SA / Higher Ed sector that would accept my BBA degree without my Master's. I've asked a couple of people in the industry, and they said that it is not a requirement to actually have a Master's degree in SA/Higher Ed to work in the industry. But from some of the job positions posted online, I realize that once you want to go higher up the career path, the Master's would be useful/a requirement to have.

So I was thinking if I should just put a hold on my decision to go to graduate school, & work on getting some experiences first back home (OPT is not an option for me to stay in the US, as I am a BBA holder and I won't be able to work in SA, even if I can find one). I've already applied to multiple SA/Higher Ed jobs (in colleges back home, in private education consulting companies, etc), and have gotten some good replies (though most of them are recruiting for immediate positions, but they do ask me to get in touch with them again once I'm back home in June). I also applied for Teach for Malaysia (equivalent to Teach for America, a 2-year teaching/leadership program), which I'm highly likely to get an offer from considering how I volunteered with them two summers ago and that they fast-tracked my application to the final stage without going through the online assessment and everything.

What do you think? Would you recommend taking a few years off to work / find experiences, or to go straight to grad school? I've probably had about 2.5 years of experience in SA (in the Admissions Office), but other than that, nothing much related to Education/SA/Higher Ed specifically.
