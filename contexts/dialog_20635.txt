MRS. KELCHER: What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
PEGGY: Oh. I forgot.
MRS. KELCHER: You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
PEGGY: I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today. Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
MR. KELCHER: Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
PEGGY: That would be impossible.
MR. KELCHER: You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
PEGGY: Mom, is there any coffee left?
MRS. KELCHER: When did you start drinking coffee?
PEGGY: Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
MR. KELCHER: If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
PEGGY: I think I'm way ahead of them.
