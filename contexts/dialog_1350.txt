MATT: But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
INSPECTOR: Then where were you?
DICKSON: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it. But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
MATT: I can't tell you.
