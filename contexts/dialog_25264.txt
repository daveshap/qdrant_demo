NICHOLS: Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
BONES: I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
SCOTTY: Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
NICHOLS: Millions?
