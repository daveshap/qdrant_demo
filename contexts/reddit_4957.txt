I want to kill myself really badly, but don’t have the guts to do so
I hate my life. I hate my lack of confidence. I hate my own beliefs and opinions. I hate everywhere I go. I hate how women just hate me. I hate how everyone calls me a cringelord and a beta male and faggot. I can’t take it anymore. I don’t even care what my family thinks, I just want to die. 

What should I do? Should I ask the doctor to prescribe me ketamine or something? Speaking of my doctor, I’ve been to 4+ therapists in my life, and NONE of them helped me. I feel like I have no where else to go. What should I do?
