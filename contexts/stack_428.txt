How can I dualboot Ubuntu 17.04 with Lubuntu (to extend battery life)? I know this is not exactly considered a smart move by tech-savvy people like you guys, but I travel a lot and I noticed that using Lubuntu's lightweight environnement helped with battery life. A lot. And sometimes all I need is a word processor, nothing else. I tried installing LXDE desktop but ended up with a very messy desktop...(I'm not an expert).My dream configuration would include the option to choose between OSs at startup and a shared partition.
