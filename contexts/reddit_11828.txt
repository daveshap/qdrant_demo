I have had this mental fog for the last year or so
just like the title says, I have been feeling for over a year now like there is this mental haziness or fog in my head keeping me from being as quick to think of things, pay good attention to people's conversations/lectures at school or thing deeply and this has been really bothering me. My memory has also been getting much worse. I don't know what could be causing this or what to do =\

Edit: I should have mentioned I am 22 years old and male
