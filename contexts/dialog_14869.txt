JIM: How much more?
MARTIN: I don't know if I should talk about this.
JIM: Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
MARTIN: If you buy what you read in the paper.
JIM: You have other information?
MARTIN: I didn't say that. All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
JIM: Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
MARTIN: Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer. I wasn't really part of the operation, you know. I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse. There were all these Cubans coming and going. They all looked alike to me.
MARTIN: Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
JIM: Was he there often?
MARTIN: Often? He practically lived there. It was real cloak and dagger stuff. They called it Operation Mongoose. The idea was to train all these Cuban exiles for another invasion of Cuba. Banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from Dallas, through New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.
