Surviving a fall into a balloon-filled pit My brothers and i have been debating this question for years. If an average person fell at terminal velocity into the center of a pit that is 1 mile deep x 1 mile in diameter, and the pit is filled with typical latex-based air-filled round party balloons (not helium-filled), would they survive the impact?  Each balloon is independent of the other balloons.ThanksEdit: this only concerns the impact, not the subsequent events that occur after the person has stopped.Edit: there are several ways to die from the impact - too abrupt of a stop (do the balloons give enough?), not enough of a stop (would you fall through the balloons? Do they pack densely enough?), static electricity (?), heat (?), etc.
