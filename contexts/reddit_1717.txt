People need to stop saying recruited athletes took their spot in college
These kids worked their butts off to become top tier athletes so that they could earn a spot on a D1 or top tier university's team. And these schools have elite athletic programs with large followings of fans, so they have to make room in their class for these athletes or they wouldn't have a competitive team. They earned their spot in these colleges, albeit a different way than most, (sometimes harder if they still have really good gpa / sat score) and its just a shitty thing to say to them that they took someone else's spot.

Edit: (parantheses)
Also, my argument is not for or against atheletics in universities, it's something that's already there and plays a big role in universities
