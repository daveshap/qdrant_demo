Grad School Interview Attire
Hi folks! Just wondering if anyone has any hot takes on what to wear to the interview days for Grad School? I'm already accepted to the programs on the stipulation that I can secure an assistantship, so I would be meeting both employers and faculty during these days.

Let me know what you or other folks wore, or what you would prefer an applicant to be wearing. I'm mainly concerned about about being under-dressed if everyone is wearing suits/blazers and I am not.
