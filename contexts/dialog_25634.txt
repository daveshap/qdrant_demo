SHERMIN: This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
JENNY: I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
SHERMIN: You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
JENNY: No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
