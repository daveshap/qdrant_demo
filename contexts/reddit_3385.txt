One of the most attractive things in a man...
...is the ability to run his own household. Honestly, I‘ve dated all types of men.

There was the one guy who was very sweet and kind but came from a Greek island so had been raised by the stereotypical Greek mum. One of his uncles had lived with my date‘s grandmother until the day this uncle married his wife. And his wife was only deemed acceptable after her cooking had been tasted. This uncle never had to cook his own meals in his life. My date had been culinarily spoilt by his loving mum as well which led to him somehow thinking that it was sufficient for himself to put onions, Frankfurter sausages and ketchup in a sauce pan to make pasta sauce.

Then there was the guy who was great at cooking but never ever bothered with tidying up. It was so stressful. I am not the tidiest of people but every 10 days to two weeks I‘ll give my flat a proper tidy and clean up. I clean my bathroom weekly and my wee vacuum robot vacuums every other day. But this guy‘s flat and house were just...they looked like he‘d just moved in, several years after he had. 

Then there were the guys who could neither cook nor clean, one’d keep plastic cups full of put-out cigarettes around for ages before throwing them out and always order in or eat out. One‘d have months worth of fizzy pop plastic bottles piling up (in Germany we get cash for them, so returning them to the supermarket is actually great!). 

And finally, I dated one guy who was actually able to look after himself. He meal-prepped every Sunday: veggies usually with chicken breast or other healthy meats, or pasta or more or less anything. He‘d cook all his own food, clean and tidy his place to a decent normal level, wash and iron his work clothes...sadly I‘m not dating him anymore but honestly, his ability to run his own household smoothly was just so attractive. Maybe I’m just judgmental but it just gave me an impression of self-sufficiency and autonomy and I KNEW that dating him would mean I‘d have an easier time sharing the household chores equally. Rather than me doing most of the chores as women in straight relationships are likely to do. Him running his own household in a healthy manner was just a very mature and manly behaviour that made me very happy. Maybe I‘m weird.

Edit: Okay, this has blown up. Some people ask me why did I break up with the last guy, or why did he break up with me.

Other people have asked me about where I dated these men and where they were from. One guy was Greek, one was Cypriot Greek, one was half-English/Asian (will not disclose nation), one was Australian (the tidy guy at the end) and one was German. I dated the German in Germany and all the other ones in the UK. I actually forgot another guy, half-English/half-French, who also ran his own household perfectly well.

Edit 2: Here‘s a speculation on why that guy stopped loving me, [click](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gwlctn/one_of_the_most_attractive_things_in_a_man/fswqeya/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
