How to end a relationship with a staffing agency?
Seems odd but I don’t wish to move forward with my current recruiter. Things have changed at the office I work at now and I don’t want to waste the recruiters time. Is there an easy way to end it without burning any bridges? I feel awkward and bad for wasting their time as I know it’s their full time job and have been working with them for over a month.
