Does CBP know about extensions? I have been on J1 visa for 6 months so the dates on my visa are 01 FEB 2017 to 01 AUG 2017 but I got an extension of 6 months (which makes it to a total of 1 year).Does CBP know about this extension, or do they consider it as overstay since my visa dates are 6 months but my departure is after 1 year?PS: I have 'D/S' written on my I-94 stamp.
