Does anyone get horrible, horrible heartache that literally is so physically painful?
When I'm sad, like really, really, sad, I get these sharp pains in my heart that are continuous and jerk tears. It hurts so much at times that it spreads throughout my body and I flinch and curl up in pain while my tears uncontrollably drop down my cheeks. My stomach hurts, and my whole body begins to ache, my head starts to pound and that's when I find comfort in the idea of ending it all - that there's a way out. Thinking about it gives me comfort. Writing letters to everyone gives me comfort. Until it feels real and it all comes back and I miss people that I love. I miss the way things were and I miss when i didn't fuck everything up. I miss when I was loved unconditionally.
