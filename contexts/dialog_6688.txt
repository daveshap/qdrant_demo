JOEY TWO TONS"": What'd you guys find?
UNIFORMED COP: Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
JOEY TWO TONS"": And the other car?
UNIFORMED COP: Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
JOEY TWO TONS"": Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
UNIFORMED COP: No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
JOEY TWO TONS"": Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
UNIFORMED COP: A Wallet. A hotel room card. Some cash.
JOEY TWO TONS"": What hotel?
UNIFORMED COP: The Holiday Hotel.
JOEY TWO TONS"": What room number?
UNIFORMED COP: I don't know. I didn't look.
JOEY TWO TONS"": Go look.
DANIEL: Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
SAMI: Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
MARCEL: How about Canada?
RAYMOND: What are we going to do, take a taxi?
