Emulating an SD-Card with a microcontroller (or Raspberry Pi) some background to my story to begin with: I went to a store and asked for a bluetooth fm transmitter for my car and the guy sold me something that only plays from an SD card and I didn't even bother to check it. So I'm sitting here trying to hack it into playing audio from bluetooth. I thought that it would use an ic to read from the SD and export audio into another ic that sends the sound to the fm antenna but as it turns out it uses a single ic for everything (even for driving the little LCD screen). So I thought that I could emulate an SD card with a microcontroller or even better a RaspberryPi and dynamically change the contents of the \"SD\" on the go. I remembered that when I was trying out online streaming sound my software created an mp3 file that continued writing the currently streaming audio and in that way it kept playing. So if I could \"stream\" a file like that into the emulated SD card and have my little FM transmitter play it I could actually create a little radio station for my car.Is something like that possible? How could I emulate an SD?
