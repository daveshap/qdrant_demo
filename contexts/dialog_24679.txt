KAT: So, tell me, how’s unmarried life?
JEFFREY: I have regrets.
KAT: Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
JEFFREY: Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
KAT: It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
JEFFREY: Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
