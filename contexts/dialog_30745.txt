NORMAN: I've got the conference next week. I want you to feel safe.
CLAIRE: I do, I do. I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
NORMAN: Think I may have cracked it.
CLAIRE: Really?
NORMAN: I think so. Maybe.
CLAIRE: You are so brilliant.
NORMAN: Yep.
CLAIRE: Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
NORMAN: You know what that does to me.
NORMAN: Ohmigod. You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
CLAIRE: You're kidding.
NORMAN: He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
CLAIRE: Wow.
NORMAN: And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, Doctor Spencer
CLAIRE: Well, that's nice.
NORMAN: ...especially Spencer's Theorem...""
CLAIRE: Oh, no...
NORMAN: ...of Perpetual Distances." Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop. "I'm afraid you've mistaken me
CLAIRE: That's...
NORMAN: ...for my father.""
CLAIRE: I'm so sorry.
NORMAN: Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
CLAIRE: That's just mean. Oh. Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
NORMAN: Did you tell her?
CLAIRE: What? No. No.
NORMAN: You didn't?
CLAIRE: Norman, you are so funny about that. No, I didn't.
