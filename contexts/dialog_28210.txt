CHARLES: My dear Aulon... That's fine...
AULON: Jeanne's been badly injured! She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
CHARLES: It's a miracle she's not dead!
AULON: We have to do something before she tries it again! I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
CHARLES: Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
AULON: But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
CHARLES: Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God? Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught. Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no. And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no. Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
AULON: No. I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
