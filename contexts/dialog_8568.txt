LANDO: .... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
LEIA: You're part of the mining guild then?
LANDO: Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
LEIA: It's a lovely outpost.
LANDO: Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city. It's connected by a transfer shaft.
CHEWIE: Barks at Han.
HAN: Not now, Chewie. Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
