Best Planner: App or Hand-written?
I'm a fourth year graduate student in a Chemistry PhD program. I didn't really use a planner before graduate school, and now I feel so lost at work without it. Seriously had a breakdown in the middle of the summer when I lost my old one and tried using a regular notebook waiting for a new planner from Amazon. 

I do it hand-written because I feel like I remember my schedule better, but sometimes it's really inconvenient since it's usually at my desk. I would like to use an app/electronic calendar, but all the apps I've seen are very rigid. They want a time and date for everything, but a lot of times I just want to write down the task as a To-Do that can be flexible or as something that is done through out the day without planning every detail (example: if I'm running a purification for a protein, I dont want to necessarily write out every step of my purification, just to know that I'm running the purification on that day). 

I know this a personal preference thing, but is there anyone out there who could suggest an app (Android/Windows)? Or is anyone out there who advocates for the hand-written option?
