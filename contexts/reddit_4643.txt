Feeling very suicidal and really need some support please.
Hi. I'm not really able to explain everything right now, but I have an enormous amount of mh problems that I've had for as long as I can remember. I crashed a bit today again - keeps happening a lot recently - but I found myself thinking to take all my pills and overdose to die. This is not okay, and I haven't felt this bad for years. I'm not going to do it, but I feel like I really want to. I have no irl support nearby, as I'm stuck in a country I'm not from and cannot go home. And obviously lockdown doesn't help. I have tried to commit suicide in the past so I know I am capable of it, but I don't actually want  to. I just want to not hurt so much, and I want to go home. All the stress I'm experiencing is quite literally breaking my body and brain, physically and emotionally. I know it could always be worse, but I am absolutely desperate. I have no idea what to do. I am hyperventilating and crying nonstop and having a complete meltdown. Please help.
