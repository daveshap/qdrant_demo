PORTHOS: Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted. I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
ARAMIS: Be quiet, you fat fool. Can't you see I'm praying?
PORTHOS: I just said you're praying! Are you deaf too? I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
ARAMIS: There are more important things than tits.
PORTHOS: Really? If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
ARAMIS: Forgiveness.
PORTHOS: Forgiveness?
