JIMMY: Louise! Where are you? Are you alright? Honey...
LOUISE: Hi. I'm okay. How are you? Long time no see.
JIMMY: Louise, honey... Where are you? You sound funny.
LOUISE: I am funny. I'm real funny.
JIMMY: Are you in town? This sounds long distance.
LOUISE: No, I'm out of town. I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy. Deep shit Arkansas.
JIMMY: Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here! I come back, nobody knows where you are. Is Thelma with you? Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts. I don't envy her if she is.
JIMMY: Where'd y'all go?
LOUISE: Fishing. Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me. This is serious. I'm in trouble and I need you to help me. Can you do that?
