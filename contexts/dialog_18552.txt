BROWN: Hey, Barney.
BARNEY: Mr Brown, sir --
BROWN: It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
BROWN: Yeah, there's a good girl. Have you had a look at this hoof? She was limping badly. I think there might be a stone in it.
BARNEY: Yeah, yeah, I did.
BROWN: Good man. And is she all right?
BARNEY: Yeah.
BROWN: Good. She's a good girl. Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl. And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
BARNEY: Yeah.
BROWN: Are you all right, Barney?
