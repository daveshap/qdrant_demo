How long should I wait to contact recruiter again?
This monday, my recruiter called me to say that my information was being processed. I am supposed to receive a call at some point to schedule a drug test, after which I'd be given a start date. I was told to call her back if I didn't get that call by wednesday, but when I did so, I got no response. I tried again on thursday, and once again got no response, and since her voicemail box hadn't been set up, I left a text message to call me back when possible. I'm a bit concerned about what is happening. Should I wait to try calling back again in a full week, or should I do so sooner? 

I presume that because of the pandemic there is significant slowdown in the hiring process, so I understand the delay, I suppose I posted this to simply relieve my stress a bit.
