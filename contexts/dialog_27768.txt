ERIN: You're in with them.
RANDALL: It's not what you think.
ERIN: You killed her!
RANDALL: No.
ERIN: Stay away from me! Stay away!
RANDALL: Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
RANDALL: They killed her because she found out.
ERIN: About you.
RANDALL: About them. You've got to leave it alone.
RANDALL: Sweetheart...
ERIN: Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
RANDALL: I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
ERIN: I don't believe you.
RANDALL: Please. Come inside.
ERIN: I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
