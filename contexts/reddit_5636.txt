Was Just Terminated Due to Poor Performance (Illinois)
Hi all,

I saw this coming from pretty far away, and I did my best to prepare for it mentally, financially, and professionally. I am not surprised by the outcome, and I've more or less come to terms with the fact.

My workload was too high prior to COVID, and it just got worse with the pandemic, and I could no longer maintain a reasonable workflow. My employers ended up taking away 75% of my clients in the end, and I tried to utilize that time to ramp up my effort in a job search. We'll see if that paid off at all. 

The environment was toxic, and every day was filled with anxiety worrying about defusing the next problem. It had all gotten to my head, but everyone advised me to stick it out and not quit so I could at  least apply for unemployment. To those people, I thank you. 

That being said, I am now in the position where I need to apply for unemployment, and wanted to ask for any advice from people who know Illinois' unemployment system. I was fired due to poor performance, do I have to approach this application from a special angle, or do I need to state honestly that I was fired due to poor performance? Not sure if this is important information, but during the phone call my manager stated that I will received 2 weeks severance, and my prorated vacation days.
