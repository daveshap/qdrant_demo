Two black, two white, two ground, one red wire in bathroom receptacle: huh? I'm going through my house (built 1940s) and replacing a bunch of receptacles with GFCIs. Most of the receptacles that I've opened up have one black and one white: I hook them up to the hot and neutral sides, pack it back in to the box, mark it ungrounded, done.We have a square metal junction box in the bathroom next to the sink (mounted on the wall, no less) that I want to throw a GFCI in, but I can't figure it out. Flipping each breaker on the main panel and a subpanel, I couldn't even stop power to it (?): I had to flip the main breaker to do so.  When I open it up, it has:two whites pigtailed to one white, connected to the upper terminal on the receptacle (neutral)one red connected to the upper terminal (hot)two blacks pigtailed to a stranded white, connected to the lower terminaltwo grounds pigtailed to two more grounds, one connected to the box, one just hanging freethe receptacle says 15A on it, but the wires are all solid 12 gauge (except for that stranded white one going from the two blacks to the lower hot terminal)the tab between the upper and lower hot terminals is intact, so both plugs are always hot (neither seem to be controlled by a switch)I tried hooking up a 20A GFCI in the same configuration, but with the loose ground attached, but no dice. Any ideas what's going on here and how I can safely attach the GFCI? (Bonus points for actually being grounded!)My next steps are going to be to crawl under the house to see if I can figure out where the wires are coming from/going to, I guess. Any input is much appreciated
