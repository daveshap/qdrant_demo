BUFFY: I'm going out the front.
PIKE: Are you nuts, Buffy? There's a hundred of them out there. They'll rip us apart.
BUFFY: You're staying here. Some of them might not come after me. If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
PIKE: You say that like it's a bad thing.
ANDY: Buffy, this is crazy. What do these guys want?
BUFFY: Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
BUFFY: Good thing one of us was prepared.
PIKE: Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
