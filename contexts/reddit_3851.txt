Don’t assume it’s going somewhere because the first date went well
This has happened to be twice now where the date goes so well I’m like for sure this is gonna go somewhere and then it doesn’t. A person can drop all the hints like saying hey when can I see you next or maybe we can check out this restaurant together one day...but straight up that means JACK SHIT. Don’t fall into the first date trap where it’s going well and all signs point to positive because you never know what goes on in the other persons brain after the date that makes them change your mind. So for everyone who gets upset when contact ends after a first amazing date remember this is just the universe’s way of saying there are people out there for you and I’m showing you that but this just isn’t the one so let me save you some time and end this after one date. Happy dating to everyone don’t get dejected and stay hopeful :)
