I finally have an emergency fund!!
I am 22 years old and have been on my own for years struggling to make rent from shitty check to check jobs. 

Over the last 3 months I have gotten better employment and have managed to save some money, Finally!!

I feel 1000 lbs lighter. I feel like the shit can hit the fan and I won't freak out, I can cover it. Flat tire? Gotcha. Fridge gpes out and ruins all my food? I'm not gonna starve. Get sick and have to take time from work? I have an extra paycheck saved just in case of that. 

I found when I plan for the worst, and expect the worst, when something less than savoury happens I have the tact to handle it with grace instead of letting it ruin my day, week or month.
