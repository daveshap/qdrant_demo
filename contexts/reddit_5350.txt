Have gone above and beyond for over two years, make one mistake and end up suspended/hours cut. Advice?
Long story short: I've been with this place for two years. I show up early and leave late every night. I do more than what's asked of me. My coworkers/manager notice, but have gotten lazy because of it. 

My bosses rarely ever come to my location. We're not considered much at all, compared to the others. Everything we have is outdated. Everything we do we put together ourselves, often on our own dime. My department is specifically suffering as our software hasn't been updated in over a year and I only get reassurances, rarely any results. 

We had a company meeting recently, of which I was late. Not on purpose, I just forgot. As punishment I was given a menial task to be completed along with someone else that was late. I ended up doing it all alone, but after my boss saw it. The other guy wasn't there. 

A week later I missed another meeting completely. Not on purpose. I'm dealing with anxiety and depression right now and I just can't do appointments. I canceled every doctor's appointment I've needed in the past couple of months because of it. 

The bottom line is that I feel taken advantage of. As much as I do for that company, I make one mistake and my hours are being cut to the point where I can't pay my rent anymore. Not to mention the money I have to pay to update software at work because *they* won't do it. 

I might have some kind of meeting with them. Should I bring any of this up? Should I bring up the depression? Should I just quit??? I don't know what to do.
