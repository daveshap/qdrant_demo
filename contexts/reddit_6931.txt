Out of work after 14 years
Hi all:

I’m sure mine isn’t the first or last post of its type.  Regardless...

After working at my company for 14 years in IT, I was informed that my (along with many other positions) were eliminated and I was let go as part of a workforce reduction.  I didn’t do anything wrong and I was told I’d be leaving in good standing.  My immediate boss also offered to write a letter of recommendation for me.

I’m getting almost 5 months of severance pay and the company is offering a professional placement/recruitment service to us who were let go for no charge for 6 months.

I know people make it through this all the time.  I know this often leads to bigger and better things for people and it really was time for a change at work.  I was stuck at my old job.  And I do have leads and heard back from one company already that my resume was moving up the chain

The fact is though, this is scary as hell.  We all play out worst case scenarios in our heads in these situations.

Anyone here been through this?  What are some tips and tricks to cope aside from the painfully obvious?
