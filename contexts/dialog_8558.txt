YODA: No, no. This will not do. Anger is what you feel.
LUKE: But I feel The Force flowing!
YODA: Anger, fear, aggression! The dark side of The Force are they. Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight. Beware, beware, beware of them. A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
LUKE: Price? What do you mean?
YODA: The dark side beckons. But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
LUKE: Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
YODA: No, no. Easier, quicker, more seductive.
LUKE: But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
YODA: You will know. When you are at peace ... calm ... passive. A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense. Never for attack.
LUKE: But tell me why ...
YODA: No! Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
