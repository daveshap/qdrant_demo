How Do Several Trees Merge Into One Hometree? According to Pandorapedia...<blockquote>  \"The name Hometree is misleading, as the structure is actually comprised of a grove of intertwined trees of the same species that have grown together, providing for mutual strength and structural reinforcement.\"</blockquote>Just to recap, a single Hometree averages 150 meters tall--a modest enlargement in comparison to the 115.5 meters of Earth's coast redwoods--but there is no info on width, which would help it immensely deal with the issue of height if the Hometree was Terran.Does anyone have a clear idea on how several small trees merge into one larger tree?
