KATE: Are you out of your mind?
JACK: I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey. We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
KATE: Annie goes to a great school.
JACK: I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
KATE: Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
JACK: This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world. Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
KATE: I can’t believe you want to move back into the city. I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
JACK: No, this is the center of the universe. If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else? Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
KATE: Jack.
