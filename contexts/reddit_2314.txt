Bombed my interview
So I had my Yale interview today. We were supposed to meet at Starbucks this morning at 9 am. So I arrived around 20 minutes early and was sitting in my car doing some last minute research and listening to music.

 I was listening to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9jdIawyCJ0 really loudly right before the interview. A woman waiting in the car parked next gave me the look of death about halfway through the song. Assuming they heard my vulgar music, I turned it off and walked to the interview. 

The same woman who glared at me and heard my music walks into Starbucks three minutes later wearing a Yale sweater. Let's just say the interview was awkward after that. Fuck it boys. I'm somewhere between ashamed and entertained. Hopefully my music choice does not impact my admissions.
