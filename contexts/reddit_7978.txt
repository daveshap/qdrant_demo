How hard is it to live in/near Central LA on my PhD stipend?
I recently got in to USC for a PhD program. My funding package comprises of a $32k yearly stipend (before taxes) + tuition + insurance. Please keep in mind, for tax calculation purposes, that I am an international student who's going to be in US for the first time. Here are my questions -

1) Will it be possible for me to rent a single occupancy room and not be net cash-flow negative? I don't mind staying away from the campus as long as there is metro connectivity.
2) What are the cheaper (but not shady) areas of town? I've heard of Koreatown and Crenshaw. 
3) How's the bicycle scene in and around central LA?

I'm not completely averse to the idea of a roommate, but I'd prefer to stay alone if possible.

Thanks in advance!
