14F and having an awful time.
Hi.

I’ve recently realised that i’m scared of talking to anyone. i’m a sensitive and emotional person and even someone raising their voice at me can upset me.

i’m at the point where i don’t put my hand up in class anymore, am scared about my friends/ peers judging me and even afraid of talking to my parents about stuff.

i hate having to feel like i don’t have a voice - it’s really shitty. there’s so much i have to say but everyone at school knows me as the ‘good girl’. also, there’s a lot my parents don’t know that i’m keeping from them and i feel so alone. i don’t feel as if my friends would understand and would turn me away because i would be ‘self-centred’.

I don’t want to keep it bottled up inside me anymore but i don’t know where to turn.

(my pm’s are open if anyone wanna talks).
