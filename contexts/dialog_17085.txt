BOWMAN: How long do I have?
CRAWFORD: Twenty minutes max.
GRAHAM: The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
BOWMAN: That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out. At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins. It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
GRAHAM: He doesn't have anything to cut with.
