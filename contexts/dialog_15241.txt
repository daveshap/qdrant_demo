TELLY: But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
CASPER: Yep.
TELLY: I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
CASPER: Yeah me too nigga.
SUSAN: You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
LINDA: Yep.
SUSAN: You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
JENNIE: Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
RUBY: Hell yeah, they don't know.
JENNIE: Like where are your erogenous zones?
RUBY: Mine?
JENNIE: Mine are like my neck and my chest.
LINDA: Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
RUBY: Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
LINDA: Oh shit.
RUBY: And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
SUSAN: Right.
RUBY: And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
SUSAN: Yeah.
RUBY: He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
