ANDERTON: Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
BURGESS: So give him a tour. He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
ANDERTON: If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
BURGESS: He's not. He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
BURGESS: Lara called me.
ANDERTON: What?
BURGESS: She's worried about you. And, quite frankly, so am I.
ANDERTON: I'm fine.
BURGESS: I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
ANDERTON: I go running down there.
BURGESS: In the middle of the night?
BURGESS: What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
ANDERTON: I'm fine, Lamar.
BURGESS: You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
ANDERTON: We won't let them.
BURGESS: No? How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
