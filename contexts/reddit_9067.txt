The Federal Reserve will soon be raising rates. Is this correct choice? Should it have happened sooner or later? What effects can we expect?
Yesterday, Janet Yellen, the head of the Federal Reserve, [announced](http://fortune.com/2016/12/14/fed-interest-rates-6/) that for only the second time in nearly a decade, the Fed's [benchmark rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate) will be going up, citing a strengthening economy and a need to finally tighten access to credit. 

This announcement comes after years of anticipation of rates rising and [worries](http://www.theworldin.com/article/12774/back-future?fsrc=scn/fb/wi/bl/ed/) that given low rates, monetary policy may be becoming less and less effective. The rise in rates also exists in the context of [growing concerns](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-14/the-next-recession-is-coming-big-deal) that another recession is on the horizon. Inflation [may finally be on the upswing](http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) and private debt [has been increasing](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/private-debt-to-gdp), indicating that a rise in rates may even be overdue. 

Was this the right time to raise rates? If not, is it too early or too late? What does the Fed hope to achieve through this rate rise? What effect do such rate increases have on the average American? On the global economy?
