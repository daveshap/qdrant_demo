ANNIE: I'm home!
ALVY: Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
ANNIE: Oh, it was... really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
ALVY: Yeah?
ANNIE: And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
ALVY: M'm.
ANNIE: And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
ALVY: Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
ANNIE: M'hm.
ALVY: G-go on, I'm interested.
ANNIE: Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
ALVY: M'hm.
ANNIE: And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
ALVY: Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
ANNIE: M'hm.
ALVY: That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
ANNIE: Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
ALVY: You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
ANNIE: Yeah.
ALVY: I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
ANNIE: In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
ALVY: Sinatra?
ANNIE: Yeah, and he's strangling me...
ALVY: Yeah?
ANNIE: and I keep, you know, it's-
ALVY: Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
ANNIE: She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
ALVY: Whatta you mean? Me?
ANNIE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
ALVY: Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
ANNIE: Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
ALVY: Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
ANNIE: Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
ALVY: Will it change your wife?
ANNIE: Will it change my life?
ALVY: Yeah, but you said, Will it change my wife"!"
ANNIE: No, I didn't. I said, Will it change my life
ALVY: You said, Will it change..." Wife. Will it change..."
ANNIE: Life. I said, life.""
ALVY: She said, Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy."
ANNIE: And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
