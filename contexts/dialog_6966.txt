FRIDA: He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
JENNIFER: There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
FRIDA: And he was ripped limb from limb?
JENNIFER: I'm sure they were exaggerating.
FRIDA: Why would they exaggerate?
JENNIFER: To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
JENNIFER: So did you do it?
FRIDA: Did I kill him? Of course not!
JENNIFER: No, did you fuck him?
FRIDA: No. I don't think so.
JENNIFER: You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
FRIDA: I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
JENNIFER: Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
FRIDA: I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
JENNIFER: I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
FRIDA: I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
JENNIFER: What? Why the hell did he do that?
FRIDA: He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
JENNIFER: And then?
FRIDA: I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
JENNIFER: At least your PMS is over.
FRIDA: And my bra finally fits again.
JENNIFER: I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
FRIDA: My vision got worse again.
JENNIFER: Are those Mark's?
FRIDA: No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
JENNIFER: Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
FRIDA: He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
JENNIFER: Rule one: always wear make-up.
FRIDA: I wonder if he's married.
JENNIFER: He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
LLOYD: I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
PETER: That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
LLOYD: Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
PETER: Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
LLOYD: No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
PETER: I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
LLOYD: Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
