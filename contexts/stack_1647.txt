Implement an 8 input AND gate with least delay I'm trying to implement an 8-input AND gate using CMOS technology with the best number of stages and least delay (I have attached the schematic in the link given). Using logical effort I have so far figured out that I should try to create a 5 or 6 stage design. I'm not sure how to find out the different configurations for a stage. Can you give me some hint or source from where I learn more about how to find the different design configurations?
