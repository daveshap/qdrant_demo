MOTHER: You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
DENISE: Oh.
MOTHER: Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
DENISE: What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
MOTHER: He tried to burn the house down, said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
