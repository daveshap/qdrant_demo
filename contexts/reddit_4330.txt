If you’ve forgotten/been unable to brush your teeth in a long time.
If you’ve been unable to brush your teeth in a long time you may have developed mild gum disease. If that’s the case brushing for the first time will lead to bleeding and discomfort.

If you’re really struggling just buy some mouth wash, the cheapest I’ve seen is 70p for a normal bottle. Using this just once a day can be a start.

When you can start brushing your teeth Use sensitive toothpaste such as sensodyne toothpaste. It will hurt a lot less and claims to repair damage. 

If it hurts, stop! When I’ve been at my worse I had to build up from mouth wash to 30 seconds then adding 10 seconds each time until I built up to 2 mins and then flossing.

If you start to floss, use sensitive floss and don’t do it straight away after a long time, it can make the bleeding worse. Work up to flossing.

I tried to find this advice a few years ago but no one is really open about it so I thought I’d share. Good luck!
