RUBY: Yep.
LINDA: But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
RUBY: Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
SUSAN: Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
RUBY: To come?
SUSAN: Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
LINDA: Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
RUBY: Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
LINDA: Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
RUBY: Yeah I get bored.
LINDA: I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
