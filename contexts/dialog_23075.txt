STU: Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
TATUM: For once, Stu, drop it.
STU: Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
STU: And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
SIDNEY: Are you serious?
STU: My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
TATUM: This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
SIDNEY: I don't know...
TATUM: Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
STU: Remember, there's safety in numbers.
SIDNEY: Yeah, okay... whatever.
STU: Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
