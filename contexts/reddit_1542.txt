I'm dying in two months.
Hey people. 

So I made a post a while ago, about how I discovered cysts in my lungs that were life threatening. Two days ago, I was told that the disease has spread, making transplant inviable. I'm very light on the details, because really, I just don't wanna know about it too much about it myself. I consulated one of the best diagnosticians in my country. It is what it is, no point knowing what to google to find reports and probabilities, ya know? 

So yeah. I've graduated from maybe dying to surely dying.

So one of the things on my to do list is to thank as many people as possible for making life a little better. All of you are number 46 to be thanked. So thank you for the laughs, the celebrations, the kindness, the "st anford"s, the chance mes. The last two years, I've visited this sub everyday. So I know all of you are gonna own college and life. Go get that bread.

I'm gonna get off Reddit now and try to do everything I can while lugging an oxygenator around. Gonna try to keep smiling and celebrating life till the end. It was wonderful knowing you all.
