I feel like I need to just say this even though it won’t mean anything.
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. 



I’m sorry for not being able to do anything. I’m sorry for being so helpless. I’m sorry for making people mad. I’m sorry for not being strong. I’m sorry for not being able to make wings for myself and reach my goals. I’m sorry for being weak. I’m sorry for not doing anything more. I’m sorry for doing nothing. I’m sorry for not helping. I’m sorry for just sitting here crying, I’m sorry for sobbing, I’m sorry for existing. I’m sorry for everything and anything I’ve ever done. I’m sorry I can’t love myself. I’m sorry I disappoint you. I’m sorry I’m an empath. I’m sorry I soak up everyone’s feelings and implode on myself. I’m sorry I pity myself a lot. I’m sorry I’m so broken. I’m sorry I hate mindfulness and get stressed. I’m sorry I draw. I’m sorry I create. I’m sorry I’m such a failure. I’m sorry I’m negative. I’m sorry I’m positive. I’m sorry either way. I’m sorry that I’m sorry.




But most of all. I’m sorry I’m not able to do anything to help you. I’m sorry I can’t give you a hug. I’m sorry I couldn’t meet you. And I’m sorry it seems nobody cares.



It may not count. But I care. I’ve said this before but I’ll say it again. I care. And I’m sorry I can’t do anything more
