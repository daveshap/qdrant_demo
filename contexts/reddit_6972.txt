Chances of Rehire?
Scenario: 

A Fortune 100 company is reducing staff in one area of the business, and lays off a 14 year, vested, top performing employee. 

The employee seeks opportunities for rehire with a different division of the same company. The employee finds SEVERAL qualified job openings on the companies site, and applies for the positions. 

Thus far (8 months), the employee draws no interest whatsoever from the company or its recruiters. 

Is it reasonable to believe that companies actually want to bring back their top performing employees (if possible)? 

These employees have already proven themselves, know the company culture, etc. 

Your thoughts please?
