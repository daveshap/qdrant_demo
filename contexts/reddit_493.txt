I need a little help
Hi I’m Bella and I’m a 19 year old girl from England. The reason that I’ve decided to join this site is because I have some issues that I don’t want to bother friends or family with because I don’t want them to worry. Recently I’ve been having some issues socially and quite frankly I’m lonely. I’m usually generally a happy person but being on my own brings me down very low and right now I do feel as though I’m completely on my own and detached from the rest of the world. From a young age I have had problems with fitting in and making friends. These problems have came and went over the years but I always felt as though as I got older these issues would fade and I would find myself some how. I have now reached the age of 19 and I still have very little confidence and I feel as though I am missing out on things that other people my age are enjoying. I constantly beat myself up for not putting myself out there and making friends but I simply don’t know how to. I always have this anxiety around people not liking me and preferring it if I wasn’t there. I feel as though my lack of confidence puts people off being around me and makes them feel uncomfortable but this thought once again just makes me even less confident. It’s starting to really piss me off tbh just taking about it now. I just wanna get on with my life and enjoy it how I should be but I just don’t know how to. Any advice or anything just to make me feel less alone with this would be very helpful! :)
