Laid off, looking for some suggestions or help
Hello, I was laid off in November. I left a pretty great job with a major company for something that promised a better work life balance and what was supposed to be a safe long term position. Unfortunately it didn't pan out that way. One of the issues is that the last to positions, although one technically a promotion have been somewhat lateral into ecommerce/marketplace management roles out of the digital marketing background that I was originally in.  


I've applied to over 100 jobs here in Austin, and I've had many phone interviews and a couple of in-person interviews but nothing seems to be panning out. Most of the digital marketing jobs that I'm looking to get are in SaaS which I don't really have any experience, I've mostly worked with more consumable type products/companies. The jobs I've found that seem to be the most interested in my have been Amazon related since I've had a good bit of Amazon experience in the last few roles. I'm worried that I've now limited my options to Amazon related marketplace management roles and limited my ability to move to my goal of Director of Marketing/Ecommerce which was part of my 5 year plan.

I'm around 9 years of experience in the digital marketing/ecommerce field which I figured would be enough. I have a solid track record and good references.

Is it just bad timing? I've only been looking for about two months now. I wasn't sure if maybe I would have better luck Q1 when there is a new budget and openings for new hires. It seems like right now most corporations are hoarding cash for acquisitions anticipating the economy to tank early next year and holding off on new hires.

I was making about $100K a year at my old job which allowed my wife to stay at home with our baby. I've been looking for positions in the same range but I seem to be limited to the $85K range now, maybe I was just somewhat overpaid before?

I would appreciate any suggestions on insurance options, I've explored marketplace but I can't really do that until next year. I'm currently using cobra until the end of the year but I can't continue to shell out $1300 a month for cobra. Is it possible to get insurance just so my child is covered? I've seen some plans but some first hand experience would be appreciated.  


Sorry for the long post, just kind of a lot going on and not really sure what else to do.
