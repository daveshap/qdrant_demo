Where’s my “won’t get a single dollar of financial aid but still can’t afford to go to a private college” gang at 😔✌🏻
and even if your parents could afford it somehow, you want to go to grad school..... so it doesn’t make sense to go to a t20/expensive private college for undergrad...... even tho u don’t want to go to a big public in-state one :(

edit: i’m most likely going to end up at one of VA’s awesome state schools, and i know i’ll be happy there, but every time dartmouth or bowdoin sends me mail, i fall in love with them a little more lol.

edit: and by grad school, i mean med school
