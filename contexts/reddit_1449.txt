I’m sorry if this gets asked a lot but... does anyone else feel too “normal” to not have a mental illness but not “crazy” enough to actually have one?
I think about this a little more than I should... and then I keep saying “you have nothing wrong with you! Your parents were right, you’re just faking it for the attention! And then think about that until you cry? Bothers me.
