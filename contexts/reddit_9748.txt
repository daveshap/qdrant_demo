Craziest student affairs story
I am currently a hall director (on year 7), and I am doing research on a number of different facets of the hall director role and I thought it would be helpful to know some of the things student affairs professionals deal with that many may or may not know considering the work we do. It can run the gamut of interactions with students, supervisors, duty stories , certain ways your department functions, etc. You don't have to use specific names or your institution. If I can get enough material to compose into a research paper, or even a book, I would change names and institutions anyway. 

If nothing else, I thought it would be fun to share among us
