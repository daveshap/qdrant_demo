does anyone else ever get into that mood where every sound is just too much and you want to cry
It’s probably something like sensory overload.

but it’s just this strong agitation that overpowers everything else and you just want everyone to shut up. 

like the only thing that will fix it is sitting in a dark room in silence and crying.

I hope you guys can relate at least a little bit
