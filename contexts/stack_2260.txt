Can you disable the on-screen control guide? I\u2019ve been playing on the normal mode (not the assist mode) and I\u2019m getting a little sick of the controls being shown on screen so much.I thought it was just going to be for the first short world, but it\u2019s still around in the desert. I understand the helpfulness for when you\u2019re controlling a captured character, but I get them when I\u2019m just running around and it\u2019s telling me how to jump and do the basic throw.Is there a way to disable this \u201cfeature\u201d?
