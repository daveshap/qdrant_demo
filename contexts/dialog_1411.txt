JESSE: This has been a good year.
FRANK: Jesse, we're outlaws.
JESSE: And we're good at it.
FRANK: It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
JESSE: You've killed your fair share of men.
FRANK: If I could go back to farming --
JESSE: That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
FRANK: I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
JESSE: We're doing this for Ma.
FRANK: Maybe it started out that way. But now...
JESSE: What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
FRANK: A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
