What current mechanisms and powers, if any, do countries such as the U.S. have in place to demand reparations from other countries?
The U.S. has recently announced an investigation into the origins of COVID-19 with a theory of it being released by the Chinese Government, even though top U.S. officials and scientists have said that it was most likely all natural.

Republican Congressman Jim Banks and Lindsay Graham have said that Trump should force China to forgive U.S. debt as reperations over coronavirus,and saying the "China must pay big time", respectfully.

Boris Johnson was reportedly told to seize Chinese property and assets as colleteral, and German tabloid Bild has put together a Â£130 Billion invoice directed at China.

So what, if any, powers and mechanisms are in place that, should specific nations wish to demand reparations or punish another nation, currently exist?

Do international bodies such as the United Nations or the International Criminal Court have powers or means to hold a nation responsible? If so, is there any legal ability to enforce these demands?

Have there been any previous examples of nations being demanded to pay reparations over mishandling of a natural/man-made disaster? If so, what were the results?
