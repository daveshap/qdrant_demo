JOE: How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
VIC: It's a change.
JOE: Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
VIC: Sure.
JOE: Take a seat.
JOE: Who's your parole officer?
VIC: A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
JOE: How is he?
VIC: Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
JOE: Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty- five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris Day as a parole officer. But a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball-bustin' prick.
VIC: I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
JOE: What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
VIC: I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
JOE: It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more. Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
VIC: Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
