WELLES: Keep moving.
EDDIE: Where do you think you're taking this, huh? Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world? How you gonna do that... ?
EDDIE: You can't go to the cops. All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
WELLES: Stop talking.
EDDIE: You got absolute zero.
WELLES: Show me where you buried her.
EDDIE: I don't know... ... out there somewhere.
WELLES: Where? Show me where.
EDDIE: I fucking don't know. What do you think... we weren't burying treasure. We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it. We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
