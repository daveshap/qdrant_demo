App like Lightroom and Photos to display geotagged images in a map I am looking for a Mac app to display locations of the geotagged photos in a folder using google maps.    I don't want to import them from Photos because:<br>a)  It is not practical to import several large images (10Mb+), get the info I am looking for (for example clicking on one of the sample thumbnails to see which photos were took in that place) and then delete all of them at the end.<br>Why that? Because I don't want Photos Library increased (it is linked to iCloud).<br>b) I don't like encapsulated data, specially because I access image folders from other computers in other OS.   I know it is possible using Lightroom but I am looking for a solution where I don\u2019t have to pay majority of the features when I want just a map. an interactive map where I can see images and explore them is a needed functionEdit 1:Google Maps because it seems to me that it has more information. I also has StreetComment 1: I am having a very simplified screen, no way to just put a thumbnail instead of a large photo, no preview screen
