What do you think of this conceptualization of the universe and time dilation? So the universe is ever-expanding. It's been expanding in all directions since the Big Bang, like how a sponge expands when you give it water. The universe is made of a fabric known as space-time. The expansion of the universe, of space-time, is how we experience time. And when our speed increases between 2 reference points, we are moving with that expansion between the two reference points. Which is why the moving object experiences time slower, because space-time is not moving through that object as quickly. I know this isn't perfect, but do I have the right idea?
