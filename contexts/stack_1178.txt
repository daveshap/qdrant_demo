Do you know if this are examples of non-identifying or identifying relationships? Im using MySQLWorkbench to model a diagram. But Im with some doubts about identifying and non-identifying relationships. It seems that all relationships of the project are identifying.For example, a conference has one user that created the conference.  So the conference table have a column \"user_id\" to store the id of the user that created the conference. A user can create many conferences so there is a 1 to many relationship between the users and conferences table. But Im not understanding if its a identifying relationship or non identifying relationship. Maybe its an identifying relationship because the conference table, the sabe in the many side, has the column user_id, so because of that is identifying? But so it seems that almost all relationships are identifying.For example, a conference can have many ticket types so there is a 1 to many relationship between the conferences and ticket types table. A ticket type also have a column \"conference_id\" so it should be also identifying?Also a conference can have many registrations so there is a 1 to many between conference and registrations, so there is a column \"conference_id\" in the registrations table. Its also identifying right? Also a registration can have many participants associated, so there is 1 to many between registrations and participants tables, so the participants table has a column \"registration_id\its also identifying right?
