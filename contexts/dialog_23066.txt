SIDNEY: I'm not here to fight.
GALE: Just stay back.
SIDNEY: I want to talk to you.
GALE: Kenny. Camera. Now.
SIDNEY: Off the record. No cameras.
GALE: Forget it.
SIDNEY: Please. You owe me.
GALE: I owe you shit.
SIDNEY: You owe my mother.
GALE: Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
SIDNEY: And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
GALE: What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
SIDNEY: Do you still think he's innocent?
GALE: He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
SIDNEY: During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
GALE: I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
SIDNEY: Have you talked to Cotton?
GALE: Many times.
SIDNEY: Has his story changed?
GALE: Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
SIDNEY: He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
GALE: He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
SIDNEY: I saw him leaving wearing it.
GALE: But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
