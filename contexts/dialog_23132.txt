RANDY: Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
DEREK: I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
SIDNEY: No, it's not.
DEREK: I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
SIDNEY: It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
DEREK: Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
