IRENE: What happened?
JEROME: You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender. Looked right instead of left.
IRENE: So you're not so smart after all. I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank. In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg-- --<i>if</i> it came to it.
JEROME: But if it came to it" then it couldn't have your-- --nose. How perfect does your child have to be?"
IRENE: You hypocrite. Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are? Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
JEROME: That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
HUGO: My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
INVESTIGATOR: Why not?
HUGO: These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
INVESTIGATOR: You worried about the cost?
HUGO: Not that.
INVESTIGATOR: They said the same thing about myopia and obesity. You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful? Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human. From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
