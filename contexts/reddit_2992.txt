Has anyone here ever left an office career for blue collar work?
Looking back, my favorite job of all time was loading delivery trucks in the morning.  It didn't pay well, but it's always been in the back of my mind that I might enjoy being a delivery truck driver or warehouse worker.   I've been in the office for 4 years now and I just don't know if I can sustain an office job without getting fat, anxious and miserable.   I'm half tempted to reach out to delivery truck drivers in my area, offer to buy them beers or coffees and try to get informational interviews.  I'm not very serious about it yet, but my gut says I should at least give it a try and see what happens.    

Does anyone have any success stories about leaving the office and going into manual labor?  I'm guessing it's not too common, but I thought I'd take a shot.
