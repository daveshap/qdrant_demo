MAUDE: She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
HAROLD: Thank you, but I really have to go.
MAUDE: But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
HAROLD: No.
MAUDE: Well then.
HAROLD: Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
MAUDE: Oh, at the dentist's?
HAROLD: Sort of.
MAUDE: Well, then, you must come back and visit.
HAROLD: All right.
MAUDE: My door is always open.
HAROLD: All right.
MAUDE: Promise?
