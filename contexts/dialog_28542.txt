ALEXANDER: ... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination. The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
PHILBY: You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
ALEXANDER: Where's the challenge in that?
PHILBY: Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor. You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
ALEXANDER: You sound like my father...
ALEXANDER: Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat. Do you want your students to turn out like them?
PHILBY: I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
ALEXANDER: I don't. I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
PHILBY: You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex. Little grey men with little grey hats.
ALEXANDER: But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
