(Update) My employer has a non-solicitation clause with a client. This client tried to recruit me for a higher paying position.
This is an update to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b7453z/my_employer_has_a_contract_including_a/

After consulting reddit and a family member, I learned that some companies ignore the non-solicitation clause in their mutual service agreement, and "buy out" an employee working for the other party when they think it's worth it.

I thought that maybe the company wanted to go that road, but I was prudent. I updated my resume and sent it to the recruiter, asking him to make sure to review their service agreement with my employer -- without telling too much.

2 days later: they want to schedule an interview. All right, got it, they want to go down that road. I chose one of the time slot they proposed.

1 day later: the recruiter sent me a short email apologizing. They won't continue the process with me as I was right, they couldn't solicit me. So yeah, he never checked first.

I felt strangely relieved, as I do love my job
despite not being paid to the level of my expertise. I decided to turn this situation to my advantage. I talked to my boss.

I explained what happened without hiding anything. I even told that I was tempted due to the salary. 

She then told me that higher management was already talking about my position, and how I progressed so much since I started 2 years ago to the point where my title and salary don't match what I do. She asked how much they were offering and took note of it. She was surprised they decided to stop the process and even felt sorry for me, but she thanked me for being transparent.

Long story short: i got a promotion last week, a more relevant title, and 30% bump in salary (higher than what was offered by the other company). 

I'm a person who hates asking for anything,  so this is quite an accomplishment for me! I hope this story can be useful for some of you!
