How do MPPT charge controllers curtail the power if the load is less than the solar generation? I am trying to understand how MPPT charge controllers work when the load is less than the solar power generation. Let's assume an off-grid system with battery backup and no dump load. In my understanding, the following situations can happen: solar &lt; load: solar will partially fulfill load requirements, rest will come from the batterysolar = load: all of the load is fulfilled by the solar directly, battery status remains unchangedsolar > load (battery not fully charged): solar will power the load and rest will go to the battery. solar > load (battery fully charged): In this case, the charge controllers curtail the power generation to match it exactly with theload. The excess solar energy is lost in the form of heat.I want to understand how this curtailment happens in actual MPPT charge controllers. Do the MPPT techniques/chips leave the MPPT mode and the operating point of the solar panel is controlled by the current drawn? In that scenario, how does this whole circuit (DC-DC converter) knows how much demand is out there? Is there any implicit feedback loop? I will highly appreciate your detailed response on the question. Please let me know if the question is ambiguous.
