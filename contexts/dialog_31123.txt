RAY: You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
GLORIA: The skinny brunette.
RAY: This is where she lives. She wants to talk. Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all. I busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
GLORIA: You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
GLORIA: That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile. It's a pretty dismal place.
RAY: It's a shithole. But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
