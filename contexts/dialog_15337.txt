KLUTE: But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
TRASK: Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
KLUTE: I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
TRASK: What else do you know?
KLUTE: I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
TRASK: We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
KLUTE: I don't believe Tom's alive.
