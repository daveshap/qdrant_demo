I'm absolutely gutted, from 100 to 0 in a instant.
So, I really haven't been that interested in dating anyone for a very long time, for at least 5 years. Sure I've met people that I liked but never really clicked, or they have other issues which stop me from wanting to be with them. I haven't really been looking... But I haven't been turning people away either.

4 months ago, I met someone who I thought was freaking amazing.  Very pretty, smart, funny, similar personalities, similar interests. She was absolutely stunning. She wasn't perfect, but initially we got on like a house on fire. Honestly It's been so long since I've felt a genuine connection with a female. I'm typically pretty awkward, but things just seemed really natural and easy going between us. We seemed extremely well matched.Issue was, that this was a camping trip and she had come from another part of the country. So we only saw each other for a few days before separating. For the last four months, we have been talking every day, and calling weekly. Things seemed really healthy, and I was becoming optimistic that I had finally found someone.

But things between us slowed down in the last few weeks. Largely because of me having a rough time with life in general.

* My sister tried to commit suicide, I saved her life after she overdosed.
* My dad has been extremely low with depression.
* My friendships have been suffering, due to me finding out about one of my good mates cheating in his relationship.
* My granddad is very ill, and likely wont leave hospital again.
* One of my mates died in a car crash.
* I lost my job (redundancy). And have been struggling financially.
* I failed study because of the above.
* I have felt really low, and depressed. Feeling like I don't have much support.

I let her know what was happening, and she didn't seem that worried at all. Although I wasn't reaching out to her as much as normal during this time, she would always respond straight away. She said she understood, and was really caring and supporting of the situation. So I planned a trip to go visit her and my brother, after things settled down. At this point we were not in a relationship, but were still really close. My plan was to see how things went, and perhaps consider asking her out if things went well (I knew for sure she liked me).Keeping in mind, I have family where she lives, and was graduating soon. The job market in her part of the country is ideal for what I'm studying... So moving to be closer to her and my family was defiantly an option. Any relationship with her wont have been long distance for long at all.

I booked flights, and she was really excited. All systems were go.... Until today. She messaged me, saying that she probably couldn't make it to our date, since she had to work instead.... I was really confused, since we had been talking about this for awhile, and she had told me she had taken the time off work.I then saw something on one of her mates snap chat, which to me looked like she was with someone else at a party.So I asked her whether she was seeing someone else. Her response, "Yea, sort of... We have been staying at each others house, and seeing a lot of each other. But we are not really dating". She then goes on to say how he is her ex, and they were together for 3 years a couple of years ago, and how they have caught up, and things are starting to pick up again.

I then asked weather I could have done anything differently, and weather things would have worked out if we were in the same city. Her response was that yes, she probably would have dated me if we were in the same city, and that she did like me.

So well, fuck. There's my weekend plans ruined. At least I have family up there, so my plans now are just to catch up with my brother, and help him work on his project car.Just feels like a really shitty ending, to a really shitty point in my life... So I've got a plane to catch in a couple of days, to go spend some time with my brother. Which is fine.... I was just really looking forward to seeing this girl. It's been so long since I've actually developed feelings for someone, and now I'm crushed.  


Edit: Grammar.   


Holy shit. Wasn't expecting such a large response everyone. Cheers for the support.
