Can mongorestore replay oplog via mongos? I'm using MongoDB 3.6.2 and configured to sharded cluster.I used mongodump to dump oplog from every shard and then restored by mongorestore via mongos, but I got below error.<blockquote>  Failed: no oplog file to replay; make sure you run mongodump with --oplog</blockquote>And then I restored by mongod that works.Is it possible to restore oplog via mongos? If yes, how to do?
