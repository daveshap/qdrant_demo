BILL: What's he so excited about?
DENISE: Yeah, showtime for what?
MOTHER: For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
JERRY: Oh, you mean on TV.
MOTHER: No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
JERRY: Great.
