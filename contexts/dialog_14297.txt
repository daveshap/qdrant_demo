JACKIE: How do you feel about getting old?
MAX: You're not old. You look great.
JACKIE: I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
MAX: It's not really something I think about.
JACKIE: Really?
MAX: Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my hair. It started falling out ten years ago. So I did something about it.
JACKIE: How'd you feel about it?
MAX: I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
JACKIE: It's different with men.
MAX: You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
