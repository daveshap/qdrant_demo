In mixed effects linear model(MEM), does random effects take variance from fixed effects? I have a question regarding mixed linear effects model.<br> For example, now I have 100 patients, and each patient has generated 10 to 30 eggs. So the dataset has 2500 rows (one egg per row). The response variable 'mature' is a binary one, 1 means this egg matures and 0 means not mature. We are interested in a variable called 'genotype' which is a trait per patient. So all the rows of same patient will have same genotype, but different patient could have same genotypes. There are 9 different genotypes. We also have some covariates, age and BMI. <br>So I want to see if genotypes associate with maturation of eggs. I know several options:Logistic regression: This one works but it assumes all eggs are independent, but we know eggs from same patient relate to each other.Generalized Mixed effects model: Similar to 1 but add a random effects of patient. I am confused about this one because I worried that the random effects(patient) would take away variation which could be explained by genotype, because genotype is the same to certain patient. I am not sure about this. <br>So this is my question: can I use Generalized Mixed effects model in this case to check relationship between genotype and egg maturation? If I can, which means the random effects is not designed to take away variance which should go to any fixed effects, how should I test the coefficient on genotype in this case, anova? If not, what is the best solution to this question? Aggregate the data to one patient one row and do Generalized linear model with beta distributed response (maturation rate), and put number of eggs per patient as weight?Thank you for any input.
