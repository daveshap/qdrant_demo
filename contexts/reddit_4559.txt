A survival story for anyone who wants to hear it ðŸ™‚
Iâ€™ve been depressed since about age ten. The initial symptoms were nothing concerning considering I was starting to become a pubescent teenager; tired all the time, isolating, I started loosing friends, no suicidal thoughts yet but it was in the making. My family moved to Colorado and I had no real friends for two years. I made one good friend in seventh grade who later tried to bully me. My dad got more violent and angry as time went on. I dropped off the cliff around eighth grade. I remember crying late at night because I couldnâ€™t fall asleep or didnâ€™t want to and have to face the next day so soon. My parents, or rather my mom I should say, noticed and tried to help the way she knew how. I told her I was depressed, and she thought Iâ€™d meant a little melancholy. It wasnâ€™t until a year and a half later that she figured out whatâ€™d been going on with me. I made it halfway through my freshman year of high school. I missed school frequently, I still didnâ€™t sleep much at all, and I began cutting. My grades dropped and I got my first B since elementary once grades came in. My parents were concerned but they couldnâ€™t understand why everything was falling apart all of a sudden. I was naturally the villain since they didnâ€™t know what else to blame it on. I still panic a little when I think about standing behind my mom and listening to my dad scream vulgarities and insults over the phone about how itâ€™d be easier to give up on me. He apologized but itâ€™s hard to look him in the eyes after everything heâ€™s done over the years. I was mentally dead by then. My plan was to climb into the mountains behind my house and freeze to death before anyone could find me. The morning before I was going to do the deed I skipped class and begged my mom to let me leave. When she didnâ€™t I started thinking of how to accelerate my plan. There was a bridge across town tall enough to end it, about twenty minutes walk away. I walked past the counselorâ€™s office before I was going to leave and paused for a moment. I was desperate, but not for death just for relief from my suffering. Thank god I made the right choice. I donâ€™t remember how I got there but I talked to one of them, he specializes in mental health issues. It didnâ€™t take long for him to call the police and my parents. Of course, I was escorted out of the school and sent to a mental hospital the next day. It took a while, half a year maybe, but I was prescribed antidepressants and Iâ€™m on my way to recovery. Thereâ€™ve been a few rough patches since, one more mental hospital visit and carbon monoxide poisoning, but Iâ€™m alive and well. Maybe even happy I guess. Iâ€™ve taken up guitar, Iâ€™m learning how to sing, I started playing soccer again, and school, for the most part, is going well. During my lowest point I was more willing to die than give life another chance, but Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m alive now. Iâ€™m not depression free yet, but itâ€™s only a matter of time. Good luck to you all, it really does get better.
