\"Can you not do that?\" I've been told that the expression \"Can you not\" (Can/Could + subject + not + verb) is used in casual conversation but it's not grammatically correct. Is this the case?I'm aware that it wouldn't be appropriate in a formal / written context. I've also heard that it's only correct when an interjection is between the subject and the verb (i.e. \"Can you please not do that?\" or \"Can you, like, not do that?\").Also, would the use of \"Could\" make the expression appropriate for a polite request?
