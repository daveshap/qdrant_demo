CHEVALIER: The cards are now my only livelihood. Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see. It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste. Do you understand the cards?
RODERICK: I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
CHEVALIER: We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
