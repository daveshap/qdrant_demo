DICKIE: What does he say?
RIPLEY: He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
DICKIE: You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
RIPLEY: I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
DICKIE: I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni.
