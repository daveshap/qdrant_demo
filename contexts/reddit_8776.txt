Firms like Uber classify drivers as contractors, rather than as employees. Is this business structure legally legitimate, or merely an attempt to get around employment laws?
Uber, the massive ridesharing company with a current valuation [greater than that of GM]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/liyanchen/2015/12/04/at-68-billion-valuation-uber-will-be-bigger-than-gm-ford-and-honda/#574856a55858), has grown by adopting a rather unique business model. Whereas a traditional firm hires employees to do its work, Uber claims to be a networking service, connecting customers with independent contractors within its network. Following this model, Uber has [grown massively](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-0822-uber-revenue-20150822-story.html) in the last several years.

However, widespread opposition to the Uber business model has grown simultaneously. While some applaud Uber for [lowering prices for consumers]( http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/08/uber-lowers-fares-in-over-100-cities/) by bypassing the artificial constraint on supply created by [taxi medallions]( https://www.thestreet.com/story/13385263/1/the-one-chart-that-should-worry-uber-and-hurts-the-taxi-medallion-short-selling-thesis.html), others have questioned the source of its success. In particular, [some claim that]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3) far from improving general economic efficiency and social welfare, Uber has become so successful by effectively shifting the burden of many employment costs from themselves to their “contractors”. In the US, as in many other nations, workers are entitled to [a wide number of workplace rights]( https://www.dol.gov/dol/rights-benefits.htm), including mandated breaks, the right to unionize, provision of healthcare benefits and so on. By avoiding direct legal “employment” of drivers, it is argued, Uber lowers costs to itself by making life more miserable for its drivers. 

Indeed, there has been a growing movement among drivers themselves to be recognized as employees precisely to claim the legal protections that come with classical employment, with the entire company now facing a [massive class-action lawsuit](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/uber-appeals-class-action-ruling-in-worker-misclassification-lawsuit/) on the matter; in California, the legal status of Uber drivers as employees [has already been established]( http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/california-labor-commissioner-rules-uber-driver-employee-not-independent-contractor.html). They key point seems to be the legal definition of “contractor”, which is similar in many states. For example, [one author states that]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3):

>Under California law, the principal factor in determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor is whether the employer “to whom service is rendered has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired.”

Uber drivers argue (successfully, in California) that [the degree to which Uber controls its drivers]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3) means they are employees, not contractors. However, there is also some evidence that driver discontent may be an isolated phenomenon: one study [has suggested that](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/operations/downloads/pdf/For-Hire-Vehicle-Transportation-Study.pdf) drivers significantly prefer contracting with Uber over working for traditional cab companies. 

Interestingly, this reclassification of employees as contractors has become [a larger pattern in the American economy that sociologists have named “Uberization”]( http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/05/18/rise-uberized-economy-means-business/). Thus, the current legal struggle affects not just Uber drivers, but has significant implications for the future of employment across the nation as a whole. 

To summarize: ***Are Uber employment practices legal or not? Do they truly add to the efficiency of the economy, or are they merely transferals of costs? Are the protests of the drivers legitimate?***
