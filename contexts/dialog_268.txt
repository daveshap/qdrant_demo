CATES: This sucks. A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
HAMMOND: You wanna leave, man? Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
CATES: You? Don't make me laugh. You can't take care of shit. You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt. All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
HAMMOND: I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
CATES: Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about. I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
HAMMOND: Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
CATES: Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
