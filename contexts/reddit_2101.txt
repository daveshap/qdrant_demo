Juniors: Bored At Home? Here’s What You Can Do
So, maybe quarantine’s getting you down. Maybe you’re like me, and haven’t done homework in weeks (would not recommend, even for a senior). In any case, you’re definitely on A2C and probably looking for something to do. Here are some ideas. 


&nbsp;


**Start planning for your letters of recommendation.**

Figure out who you’re going to ask, and start preparing all the materials. I have a whole post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gm1jbc/letters_of_recommendation_101/) that dives into much more detail on what you should be working on.

**Start narrowing down your college list.**

This is pretty important. I thought I had picked out a good list, and then changed my mind about applying to a lot of colleges, and **then** I thought I had figured it out by the time I had submitted my apps. After submitting, I realized I didn’t want to go to some of the schools I applied to, whether it was fit, financial aid, or strength in my major.


Here are some quick tips on choosing what colleges to apply to:

* If you need financial aid, apply to colleges with generous financial aid. Most T20s and top LACs offer the most generous financial aid. Run each college’s NPC (Net Price Calculator) to determine how much you would get. These are generally extremely accurate unless you have a weird source of income or other extenuating circumstances.

* Side note: also **consider colleges with generous merit scholarships**. u/ScholarGrade has a very thorough list [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/azu8o2/change_your_trajectory_full_ride_scholarship/). Keep in mind that these are extremely competitive. You need higher stats than even those who get into T20s. (Usually, those who get these are those who get into HYPSM etc., the merit sways them and gets them to attend these schools instead). 

* **Consider fit over shotgunning.** Some colleges have very different cultures than others. For example, Duke, Vandy, and Dartmouth are all T20s that are very fratty, and on the other end of the spectrum, you have schools like MIT, UChicago, and Caltech which are more known for their course rigor and difficulty (others would call it stress culture). 

* **Find schools that are strong in your department of interest.** Some schools are known for certain things, others are excellent for everything (cough cough Stanford). For example, Georgetown SFS is hands-down the best program for international relations, UPenn Wharton is the best for business, etc. Georgia Tech is great for engineering, Purdue & UIUC are great for CS. 

* Yes, put that college that is “out of reach” on your list. Even if you don’t get in, you aren’t left wondering what could’ve happened.

**Start drafting essays.**

I know it’s early, but the work you put in now means that work that you won’t be suffering over essay writing during Christmas or New Year’s. Keep in mind that Common App wipes/resets every August, so you shouldn’t start filling in anything in Common App yet. Most schools’ supplements stay the same or change very slightly each year, so I wouldn’t worry about your effort going to waste. Even if they do change the essays, you can probably use the already written essay for another school, and you’ve gained experience writing essays. 

Speaking from personal experience, I found that it took much longer than anticipated to brainstorm essay topics, write them, and then edit them until I was satisfied. And despite the fact that my essays were not great in the summer, it gave me a good foundation to approach more supps in the fall as well as a crude draft of some supplements to refine.


&nbsp;


**Start studying for standardized testing.**

I’d say drop the SAT IIs (unless your schools require them), most schools don’t care much about them and many other schools are dropping the requirement/the option to even submit SAT IIs (hello MIT & Caltech, trying to lower your acceptance rate?). r/SAT & r/ACT are great places to find advice or other free resources. My guess is that less emphasis will be placed on test scores, but it’s still important: colleges still have to pad their median SAT & ACT scores.


&nbsp;


**Start working on a personal project.**

This isn’t as daunting as it sounds. Find something you’re legitimately interested in, and pursue it, even if it’s for an hour a day. I imagine you guys have a lot of free time. Personally, I’ve been improving my cooking & baking (free time = lots of breadmaking), working out a lot, exploring my town through biking, and a little bit of Python coding. “Sure,” you say, “but that doesn’t even sound like an EC to me.” Wrong: I literally put cooking as one of my ECs (I spent a decent amount of time on it last year), and was able to talk about it in a meaningful way. Plus, it’s an extremely valuable life skill. 

Working out may not be an EC in of itself, but you can certainly make it into one. I founded a fitness club at my school to coach other kids, and talked about that as an EC. “Well, I can’t do that now.” Obviously not, but I actually saw a reddit post on A2C asking if anyone wanted to get in shape and keep each other accountable. I asked OP if they wanted to make a groupme, and now we’re at 80+ members and counting. I’ve also helped set up a google classroom to keep group members accountable and to help coach others. That, combined with working out, can definitely be counted as an EC. (If any of y'all want the link, please chat/PM me).

**Or, look for other interesting things to pursue.**

It doesn’t have to be a project, but there are certainly things you can be doing. One of my friends was doing shopping with InstaCart (relatively safe, the only risk is when you go shopping, the delivery is contactless) and making $20/hr. A job is always an EC. Speaking from personal experience, part-time or entry level jobs are also looking for workers now. 

Or maybe there’s something else you’re interested in. Maybe that’s reading (if that’s fanfiction, I don’t judge and AOs will never know if you just list reading as an coronavirus activity), or writing, or drawing, or painting, or woodworking, or learning a language, or anything else you can think of. The best thing to be doing is learning **something** that you’re interested in. COVID-19 has given us a gift in the form of a shitton of free time to take a breath and slow down.

**TL;DR**: make a college list, get LORs, start your essays, pursue your interests.
