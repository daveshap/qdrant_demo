LOGAN: Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
MAX: The other ones?
LOGAN: The other one like you...
MAX: You lost me.
LOGAN: C'mon, Max. First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
LOGAN: L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures. Then the lightbulb went off.
MAX: You did go through my stuff.
