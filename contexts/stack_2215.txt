Is there any use for collecting extra BluGlo during a mission? While some quests (Ride the Lightning, Defend the Atlas, etc) require BluGlo to complete, others don't require any at all. Also, random objects on the map sometimes require BluGlo, like team buffs and radio towers. However, in one game, after encountering multiple trolls, I ended up with well over 20 BluGlo, which begged the question: is there any purpose for collecting this much BluGlo? There weren't enough team buffs or radio towers to use up all this BluGlo, but I'd certainly hate to collect all this BluGlo every mission for no reason.Is there any benefit to stocking up BluGlo during a mission?
