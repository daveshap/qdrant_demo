I’m so fucking afraid
My dad is sick rn. My grandma is sick too. 
Normally I would not really care since they have weak immune system but because of the whole pandemic I am concerned now. I know mortality rate among those who are old and weak is much higher than for the rest. Both my dad and grandma fall in the category of old and weak. I’m so afraid. 
Healthcare in my country sucks. Until a few days ago they were hiding that there are people with virus and now there 30+ cases just in 3 days. And I know that a lot of people don’t go to the doctor. I know that a lot of people don’t care about quarantine. I know that a lot of people didn’t give a fuck to all the warnings about washing hands and not touching faces. And because of them there is a chance that my dad and grandma might have caught virus. They self quarantined themselves but they didn’t go to see doctors since their symptoms are not exactly the same as the ones that are usually listed. 
But still I’m really scared. I’m abroad now and I’m going to fly back to them in 3 days. I will also isolate myself from them in case that I actually carry the virus.


But I’m still afraid that something bad will happen.
