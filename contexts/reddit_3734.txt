Hilarious update
So about a year ago, I posted about a Tinder date ghosting me after 2 great dates.  We had had sex, great chemistry, then all of a sudden she went super cold and stopped making an effort.  After a month of pursuing her, I gave up.

Fast forward to last August, where she texted me apologizing. At the time she had just been out of a 10+ year relationship and emotionally was fucked up.  She asked if we could go out again, now that she was ready.

We've now been dating for 8 months and it's going well.

You never know what's going on with someone. Chances are if someone ghosts you out of the blue, it has more to do with them and their life than yours!
