What are the arguments for and against abolishing the Immigration and Customs and Enforcement agency (ICE)?
[Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Immigration_and_Customs_Enforcement) (ICE) is a U.S. law enforcement agency that was formed in 2002 by combining several border and revenue enforcement agencies under the newly established Department of Homeland Security. Its [mission](https://www.ice.gov/about) is to enforce federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration to promote homeland security and public safety.


Recently, some Democratic candidates have [laid out arguments](https://www.thenation.com/article/its-time-to-abolish-ice/) for abolishing the agency and a number of others have [gotten behind the idea.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-democrats-ice-analysis-20180624-story,amp.html) Here's a [full explainer.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/19/17116980/ice-abolish-immigration-arrest-deport)

President Trump, on the other hand, has [strongly supported ICE and said there's "zero chance" of abolishing it.](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/394950-trump-blasts-dem-push-to-abolish-ice-zero-chance)

What are the strongest arguments for and against abolishing the agency? Assuming the US wants to maintain some means of enforcement for immigration and customs laws, what proposals have been put forth to take over the mission of ICE if it were to be abolished?
