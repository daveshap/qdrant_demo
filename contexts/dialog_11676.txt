MARTIN: ...About five years now.
DEBI: Get the fuck outta here.
MARTIN: Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other..."
DEBI: You're a government spook?
MARTIN: I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
DEBI: Jesus Christ!
MARTIN: Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
DEBI: Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
MARTIN: Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
DEBI: Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
MARTIN: A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
DEBI: You never could have kept this from me.
MARTIN: I was leaving.
DEBI: That's probably a good idea.
MARTIN: Will you come with me?
DEBI: I'm staying here.
MARTIN: What if I come back?
DEBI: I'll hide.
