You have two types of teachers
So I asked my AP Calc teacher for a college application more than a month ago and he still has not done it yet.

I have reminded him countless times that they were supposed to be due on the 1st but nope still nothing.

Also keep in mind that:

1. He only teaches maybe 3-4 classes, meaning he has 4-5 free periods
2. Every time I've asked him, he tells me "he'll do it by the end of the day"

So instead, I email my microbiology teacher from last year who:

1. Is in another country currently (the country doesn't have the best wifi either)
2. I emailed through a school email (WHY IS THIS MAN CHECKING HIS SCHOOL EMAIL ON VACATION!!)

and he completes it in three days.

WHAT THE HECK!
