Using iteration in Model Builder for Clipping features in an ArcGIS File Geodatabase I have to Clip the data in a file Geodatabase in which there are about 80 Feature Datasets which includes about 20 feature classes in each one of the Feature Datasets. I have created the model once which iteration of \"Feature Classes\once with \"Datasets\" and once with \" Workspace\". I was able to do some clipping but None of them do it through the whole GDB and just get the first Feature dataset. How can I make it automatically for the whole FGDB?
