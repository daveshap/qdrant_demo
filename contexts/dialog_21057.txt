STEW: Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account—
CONROY: Do you call yourself a reporter?
STEW: It has been alleged - yes—
CONROY: You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
STEW: Not on my own beat, no.
CONROY: No? Well, where were you when that happened?
CONROY: I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it! Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work. Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
STEW: No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
CONROY: Why not?
STEW: Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
CONROY: What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
STEW: Yes, sir.
CONROY: Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
