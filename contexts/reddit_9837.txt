For those of you in hiring positions, what are some qualities and/or experiences that you look for in potential candidates?
Sorry if this has been posted before or is the wrong place. I did a quick search and didn't see anything.

I'm hoping to embark in a career in student affairs after graduation and just looking for general qualities and/or experiences.
