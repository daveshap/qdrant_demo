I want to get revenge on a guy. Should I? How can I legally do it?
This guy who screwed my mental health more than it was has been making me angry for never getting what he deserves, I’ve changed school now and I want him to know that he messed with someone he shouldn’t (without him knowing who was), maybe just ruining his day or just one minute of his life. 

My older brother has told me that it’s wrong to think this way, but I cannot help it.

What should I do?

I might provide certain information about me if anyone has an idea of anything I can do. And I won’t mind if someone tries to help me stop thinking like this (this might sound contradicting but I really want to get revenge or feel calm with myself)

I ask reddit because you give great advice, thanks.
