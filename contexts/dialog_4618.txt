MARIE: Where were you, Jason? In the car.
BOURNE: Conklin up front.
MARIE: I'll get the book.
BOURNE: No. There's nothing new.
MARIE: You're sure? We should still -- we should write it down.
BOURNE: Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
MARIE: -- it hasn't been two years --
BOURNE: -- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway! You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
MARIE: We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
BOURNE: I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
BOURNE: I'm trying, Marie, Okay?
MARIE: I worry when you get like this.
BOURNE: It's just a nightmare.
MARIE: I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
MARIE: Sleep. Sleep now.
BOURNE: I should be better by now.
MARIE: You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
BOURNE: But it ends up the same.
MARIE: One day it will be different. It just takes time. We'll make new memories. You and me.
