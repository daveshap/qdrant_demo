Before figuring out if they like you or not, dating is kind of stressful
One thing that is a bit anxiety inducing about dating is trying to figure out if they are into you in the beginning stages. If they don't message me for a while, then I'll just sit there and wonder if they are ghosting me now or what? Are they just busy? Like, when I finally know they are into me then I'm fine. I don't care if they dont text me for awhile or not. It's just that beginning stage that's hard to figure out that's a bit unsettling....i guess perhaps if I have to guess too much I should just move on or try dating two people at a time (if we are casually dating and are not exclusive yet)
