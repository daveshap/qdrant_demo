SIMON: Whenever your're ready, Captain.
OVEUR: Yes, sir, commander. This is Mercury One. Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
ELAINE: Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
RUMACK: The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder. Let me show you. Ted's problem is in this area. This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
RUMACK: So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
ELAINE: What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
RUMACK: You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
ELAINE: I mean for Ted.
RUMACK: You can be gentle with him, Elaine. He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
ELAINE: Is that a good sign, Doctor?
