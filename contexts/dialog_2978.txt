BASQUIAT: I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
ANDY WARHOL: That's good. At least they're interested.
BASQUIAT: Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it. The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?""
ANDY WARHOL: Wow... Stop giving them away. I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
BASQUIAT: Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
ANDY WARHOL: Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
BASQUIAT: Cool.
ANDY WARHOL: My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
BASQUIAT: Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
ANDY WARHOL: Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
BASQUIAT: Ouch..
ANDY WARHOL: What's wrong?
BASQUIAT: That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
ANDY WARHOL: Do you still love her?
BASQUIAT: Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
ANDY WARHOL: Well, have you asked her to come back?
