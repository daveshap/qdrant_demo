What is your opinion of “sink or swim” onboarding?
Hello!

I am a new grad, I graduated college back in December and I am currently getting a masters degree. 

I previously worked for a company that hired me when I was three months out of college. I was told after a few weeks that the company culture was “sink or swim”. I ended up being fired within the first 90 days.

Lately, I have been actively avoiding companies that are sink or swim and have been actively asking questions about company onboarding procedure during the interview process.

Many people think sink or swim is a valid onboarding strategy, but I don’t understand it. It personally seems like a bad idea, especially for new grads and interns. How do you guys feel about the sink or swim approach to onboarding?
