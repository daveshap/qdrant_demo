How to split an ODS spreadsheet file into csv files per sheet on the terminal? I would like to split a spreadsheet (ods or xlsx) into multiple csv files, one for each sheet in the spreadsheet.I would like to do this without launching a graphical app and preferably in a one liner.Any ideas?Though the linked duplicate provides a possible solution in one of the answers (not in the accepted one) and was helpful. The solution does not work with ODS files as I requested, and I consider the question to be sufficiently different.
