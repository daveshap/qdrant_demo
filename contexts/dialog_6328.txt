LILY: Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
ASHBY: Tough day?
LILY: Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
ASHBY: Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
ASHBY: My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
LILY: Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
ASHBY: So, what do you do?
LILY: It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
ASHBY: Silicon Valley?
LILY: That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
ASHBY: Can --
LILY: On me. For the seat. Cheers.
LILY: So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say no" without ever using the word."
ASHBY: Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
LILY: Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
ASHBY: No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
LILY: Really? Wish we had met eight hours ago.
