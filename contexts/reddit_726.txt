Ok hear me out
Ik im all bout spooky stuffs but i need help. Im a very introvert person and i have this guy i like. I have him in 2 classes and then lunch. Hes mexican (or i think he is) and about 5'5. 
1. He doesn't look at me 
2. We dont talk
But we have like friends that know eachother.
So ik this may sound stalkery but i recently found his insta while looking at his freinds profile. He hasn't posted anything tho. I followed him on one of my other accounts and havent gathered the courage to actually text him
 Like what do i say, or what will he say
Like "how did you find my insta" and that kinda embarrassing. And like im afraid he'll see me at school and be like, freakin weirdo

 Also im verry ugly so that may be a problem
