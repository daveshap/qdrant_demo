The "reasons to live" askreddif thread only made me feel worse
There are people out there who can be content with the smell of freshly fallen rain and warm garlic bread meanwhile I could have everything and still be miserable.

That entire thread was just a reminder that I'm too broken to relate to other people and I'll never be happy.
