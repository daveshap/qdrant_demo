JOE: 'Big'?
SUSAN: You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first. You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
JOE: I am Joe.
SUSAN: Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
JOE: That is not my intention.
SUSAN: What are your intentions? To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool. I don't get it. You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset. Who are you anyway? And what are you eating?
JOE: Peanut butter.
SUSAN: You act like you never had peanut butter before --
JOE: I haven't.
SUSAN: -- What kind of childhood did you have?
JOE: Do you love Drew?
SUSAN: Come again?
JOE: When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
SUSAN: Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
JOE: I'm sorry. Do you live here?
SUSAN: No, Joe, I'm swimming here. Then I'm going home.
JOE: I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
SUSAN: I've got plenty of friends.
JOE: I don't have any.
SUSAN: I can see why.
