What did I do wrong?
When avengers endgame came out I asked this girl who I was really good friends with if she wanted to watch it with me. She said yes and we agreed on a date. Note: prior to this we always texted and snapped each other regularly. The day before, she canceled with me in favor of some other guy who asked her to go a day earlier than our planned day. I, as the understanding friend, relieved a deep sigh and simply accepted my defeat. I was definitely disappointed but no hatred ever came out. I simply said, “oh,ok. Hf then. Don’t spoil the movie”. After that, things started to go down hill. 2 days after, I asked “wyd”... opened message, no response. *this is on Snapchat rn btw* a couple weeks later I try to spark up a conversation. Same thing, opened message but no response.... weeks go by and I simply stopped trying to make a conversation. I still keep a streak with this girl but, that’s it. 

Did I do something wrong? Did I mess up somewhere? Please help me find the answer.
Much appreciated:)
