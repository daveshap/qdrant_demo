The only sense of direction ive ever had in life haseither been from a toxic dependence on women, or drugs.
Taking myself out of addiction to stimulants, and ending my toxic relationships ive found myself very lost. i have no sense of where to go, who i want to be, or what i want to do. I tried making a list of goals, and they feel so forced. "get fit" "save money" "practice music". it feels so meaningless, and while i would like these things, they dont seem to invoke that drive in me. when i was in a very dependent relationship at different times in my life i had direction, the need to cling onto my SO consumed me, it gave me a role to fill, and it made me happy. the same went with drug abuse, that passionate need for something, that sense of direction, i knew what i needed. i was an addict, i knew who i was, and what to do.

everything else feels so mundane and uninteresting, anything i try to get into just doesnt really do it for me anymore. i dont feel like i fit.
