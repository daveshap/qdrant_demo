SCOTTIE: The color of your hair...
JUDY: Ah, no!
SCOTTIE: Judy, please it can't matter to you...
JUDY: The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
SCOTTIE: Yes.
JUDY: All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
