AL: Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
OUTSIDE -: JOE Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
AL: GO-TOE. It's some islands.
OUTSIDE -: JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
AL: It's all we've got.
JOE: What do we do?
AL: Send a man there. A secret agent.
JOE: Who?... Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
AL: You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
OUTSIDE -: JOE What abilities...?
AL: Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
JOE: You mean...just leave.
AL: We get on a plane.
JOE: We get on which plane?
