BARTENDER: You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
ROADIE: Fuck you too.
BARTENDER: Get in line!
HEROINE: HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
BARTENDER: What!? I'm not going down there again!
HEROINE: This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it. Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
BARTENDER: This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
BEER GUY: I'm in.
HEROINE: Anyone else?
