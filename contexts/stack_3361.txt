Was there a story where Superman defeated Brainiac by forcing him to fly into his own shrinking ray? When Supergirl meets the Legion of Superheroes for the second time (Action Comics #276, \"Supergirl's Three Super Girl-Friends\") she is introduced for the first time to Brainiac 5, Brainiac's 30th century descendant.In this story, Brainiac 5 claims that Superman defeated Brainiac by forcing him to fly into his own shrinking ray. Was this ever an actual Superman story?
