GINA: So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
BASQUIAT: He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
GINA: Don't you think he's using you?
BASQUIAT: Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
GEORGE: Would you like to see the wine list?
BASQUIAT: Chateau Latour '64, please.
GINA: So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but – whatever. I'm really excited. And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
BASQUIAT: How is he?
GINA: Pretty much the same.
BASQUIAT: Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole. Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're –
GINA: What's that about?
BASQUIAT: Forget it.
GINA: That is amazing. What year is it?
BASQUIAT: George?
GEORGE: I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
BASQUIAT: See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
