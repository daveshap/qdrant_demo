How to learn soft skills?
I've developed bad personality traits that impede my job search. I have skills which most employers like and invite me to interview but lack joyful, ecstatic, friendly skills. 

I consider myself to be a stoic type but it comes across as apathetic and lethargic.

Any ideas on how to improve? I do have a good work ethic but putting on a smiling face is hard for me.
