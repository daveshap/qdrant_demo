LPT: Women, when you have a few extra dollars, stock up on pads, tampons for the "lean" times.
I once was so low on money and was waiting for a paycheck to clear, that I had to call out sick at work and sit at home with a dry washcloth in my underwear because I had no money to buy pads or tampons during my period. Since then, whenever I have a bunch of change to turn into bills or 5 bucks in my pocket, I buy a random on-sale box of pads or tampons, so I'm ready in case I have no extra money when my period hits. This can also be done with soap, a quality deodorant, or a toiletry that you don't buy regularly. 

Edit: Due to medical reasons and much trial and error, I myself do not use a Diva Cup (I use the heaviest flow OB non-applicator brand of tampon instead), and I can't take hormonal birth control. These are all great things, but they just don't work with my body and pre-existing conditions. But I'm glad everyone is posting tips!
