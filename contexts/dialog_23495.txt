WILL: Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage! Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
SAM: I am, Master Shakespeare.
WILL: But your voice Have they dropped?
SAM: No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
WILL: Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
FENNYMAN: I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
WILL: Yes, I saw it.
FENNYMAN: Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
WILL: Better fortune, boy.
URCHIN: I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
WILL: You admire it?
URCHIN: I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
WILL: Oh. What is your name?
