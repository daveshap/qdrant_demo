FIGURE: Who does it serve?
PERCEVAL: You, my lord.
FIGURE: I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
PERCEVAL: Because you and the land are one.
FIGURE: I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
PERCEVAL: You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
