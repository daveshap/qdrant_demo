Do people really enjoy their careers?
Like is this a normal feeling for people? Because I'm trying to figure out why does every career/job in life sound so boring to me?

I'm in my mid 20's and I'm trying to leave my miserable restaurant job.  I'm currently in school now and I hate it. I've switched majors like 3 times an I'm still bored. I've tried marketing, accounting and business admin and none of those fields interest me. I've looked at other areas of work outside school **(IT/WEB DEV, trade school and military)** but they also sound either too hard or boring.

All I have is like 7 years of restaurant experience. This is a toxic industry and I want to get out now, but I'm not sure what else I can do.
