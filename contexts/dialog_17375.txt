TONY: Get out of here before this really goes up.
CHARLIE: Hide the gun. Throw it away. Anything. Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
TONY: Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away. You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
JOHNNY BOY: I think we should see your uncle.
CHARLIE: No.
JOHNNY BOY: This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
CHARLIE: Forget it.
JOHNNY BOY: What are you going to do? Hide me?
CHARLIE: Good idea.
