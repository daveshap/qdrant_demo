I've wanted to kill myself for awhile now, but just had my favorite soup
Something as simple as a good soup makes me want to stick around. Not only that but my guild on WoW Classic is very welcoming to me.

Be happy for the little things, they may just save your life...

Edit: It's Campbells Chunky Jazzy Jambalaya Soup, spicy and full of rice and sausage/chicken

Edit #2: My toon is Katyperry, a Level 6 Human Mage on Deviate Delight RPPVP Server on Classic WoW
