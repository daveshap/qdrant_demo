Wifi not working on Ubuntu 16.04 after just being installed alongside Windows 10 I have just installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and the installation went smoothly but I can't seem to connect to WiFi, the button to select networks is greyed and it shows WiFi Network disconnected. I have looked through the other threads and none seem to be working...My laptop uses Realtek RTL8723BE 802.11 bgn Wi-Fi Adapter
