Explanation for "hell yes/no" culture?
I see a lot of ppl responding to questions about feeling uncertain or unsure about a potential partner with "if it's not hell yes then it's hell no." That's pretty extreme.

It's as if lately we encourage highly emotional decision-making in dating and rationality is getting lost. When did it become not OK to have some doubts when first getting to know a new person? Why isn't it OK to question or challenge your feelings about a new person? Serious relationships can develop slowly. Can't it be argued that a slow steady relationship build is preferable to quick and careless, so to speak? Using critical thinking in new relationships sounds good to me, rather than going with highly charged instincts. 

Full disclosure, my recent semi long term relationships started with "hell yes" and little questioning. And they were all bad decisions in the long run. So this question of *where did rationality in dating go* is partly personal as well as a general observation.
