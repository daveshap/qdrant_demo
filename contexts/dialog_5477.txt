THEO: Since when did you guys start changing tires?
OFFICER GRILLO: Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
THEO: Seems not.
OFFICER GRILLO: If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
THEO: Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
OFFICER GRILLO: Mind if I have a look?
THEO: Why are you picking on me for?
OFFICER GRILLO: Was I picking on you? How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
THEO: Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
GRILLO: Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
THEO: I got to get going. An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
GRILLO: They'll wait. Meantime, raise the lid.
THEO: What'd you do? Tail me from Brentwood?
GRILLO: Why would I do that?
GRILLO: Let's have your license, mister.
THEO: I'm going to level with you officer.
GRILLO: What's this?
THEO: See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury. On the job.
