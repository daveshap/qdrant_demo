PENDERGAST: I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish. Like nothing I ever saw. I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
MARGO: It's not supernatural. Mbwun is an animal. Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
PENDERGAST: But this isn't the jungle! This is New York. How did it get here? A thing like that crossed two continents. It makes no sense!
FROCK: We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
PENDERGAST: I don't believe it.
MARGO: None of that matters now. The people upstairs need us. We have to help.
FROCK: We can't. We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe. I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements. If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do. The building must be swarming with police by now. It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
MARGO: That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
PENDERGAST: But what can we do? Our guns are useless --
MARGO: We have the fibers. Don't you see? The creature is hungry. It wants the hormones in these plants. It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers. We're just a poor substitute. To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
