Help me pls

So I guess I’ll just get to the point. There’s this girl that I haven’t known that long but it’s pretty obvious we have a connection, at least from what my friends have told me. So I like her, I don’t know how much yet but I definitely do, and Im pretty sure she has some feelings for me too. But main problem is she’s got a boyfriend, and I’m definitely not the type to be with someone who is cheating to be with me. I’ve had that happen and it basically destroyed any sense of confidence and feelings of worth in me. I haven’t even dated anyone since and it’s been like a year which I guess is pretty stupid but I trusted her so it hurt, any advice my trusted allies on reddit?
