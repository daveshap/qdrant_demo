HOMER: You're not yet three months, are you?
ROSE ROSE: Not yet. What do you know about it?
HOMER: I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
ROSE ROSE: Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
HOMER: But you don't look very happy.
ROSE ROSE: *Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
HOMER: Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
HOMER: What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
ROSE ROSE: You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
ROSE ROSE: Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
HOMER: Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
