Anyone else feel so self-aware of their anxiety, it almost feels like you’re faking it?
Even in the middle of a mild panic attack, I can feel myself freaking out — I know my breathing is shallow, my heart is beating really fast, and my thoughts are scrambled and erratic. But because I’m aware of all of this, it almost makes me feel bad, like I’m putting on some kind of performance, or am just reacting this way for attention (even when I’m by myself!)

Maybe it doesn’t make a lot of sense when I type it out, but does anyone else feel this way?
