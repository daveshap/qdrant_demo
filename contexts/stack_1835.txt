\"Sitting with Mike is/are the parents of the boy who died\" For the sentence:<blockquote>  Sitting with Mike is the parents of the boy who died.</blockquote>Should it be is or are? My instinct says it should be<blockquote>  Sitting with Mike are the parents of the boy who died.</blockquote>But Grammarly etc are not picking either up as wrong. Can someone help with this, as I am unsure of which is actually correct? Or are they both? Is it because parents is plural so are can be used, but the boy is singular so is can also be used? Which is technically the subject of the sentence?
