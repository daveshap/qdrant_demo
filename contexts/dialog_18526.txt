LADY ELY: The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
VICTORIA: Just them?
LADY ELY: Yes, ma'am.
JENNER: We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
VICTORIA: Whom?
VICTORIA: That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex. Silk suits you well. But you are not eating enough. One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: Yes, ma'am.
