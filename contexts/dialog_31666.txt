PETRA: They tell me you're an American agent.
XANDER: What are you talking about?
PETRA: There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
XANDER: It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
PETRA: Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
XANDER: If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
PETRA: That's alright, I'll figure something out.
XANDER: Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
