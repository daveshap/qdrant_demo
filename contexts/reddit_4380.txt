My girlfriend is struggling horribly and wants to kill herself.
I (20M) am beyond confused as to how I can help my girlfriend (20F) get out of this rut. Her and I are very close and we can talk about anything at all. 

Today she had a huge anxiety attack at school and when I brought her back to her house she was hysterical- she was screaming and crying and would not stop for an hour or so no matter what I did. I feel like I’m an extremely supportive boyfriend to her and I know that I treat her right and help her all the time. 

She told some that she wishes she was dead and that she genuinely is wanting to take her pills and kill herself today. She’s attempted it before, but it’s been 2 years since she did. I took her pills away from her so she couldn’t and now she’s asleep on her bed and I’m here in the dark looking up ways to help her even more than I have been. She’s been down like this for about a month and is falling behind in all of her classes, her work, and she hates her body. 

I was supposed to be at work 2 1/2 hours ago but said I’d be late because I had to stay home for a little. I’m afraid to leave her alone because she gets very frantic when she’s like this, but I don’t know what else to do as I’m a personal care giver to blind and dead individuals who need me to be there ASAP (nobody can cover my shift). 

HOW DO I HELP HER. I’ve never been in her position and I need to know how I can help her throughout the day rather than just when she needs me.
