USB Power Only - Detect Device Plugged In I have a project that I need to complete for work. We have been working on this project for a while, however I have come to a bit of a road block. I'll first lay out the important points.We have a Raspberry Pi &amp; a USB Hub with Charge Only cables plugged into it.We want to be able to turn the power from the USB Hub to the device on/off depending on certain conditions.The USB Hub, we want to detect if a device (e.g. Smart Phone or Portal Battery Charger) has been plugged into one of the charge cables. We have charge cables currently, they plug and receive charge straight away.I'm currently using uhubctl to turn on/off ports.Using Linux, I need to detect a device being plugged in/unpluggedProblem: When I use Data &amp; Charge cables, I fall into 2 issues.iPhone require their users to \"trust\" the device first before it will accept charge.It opens a vulnerability in terms of juice jacking which I'd like to avoid.Solution: Don't use Data &amp; Charge cables, use charge only. Problem with this approach is I cannot detect a device being plugged in.With that information, I have hit a bit of a roadblock in terms of available hardware to achieve our goal.So, my question boils down to this:Is the approach and I'm taking correct. What I mean is: Using the USB Hub &amp; Charge Only cables.Is there any available solutions out there in the market that you could suggest I investigate?Is there another potential approach I have not considered that you could suggest?I don't need any data, so charge cables are a perfect solution if possible (not mandatory though). But, I need to be able to detect if a device has plugged into the USB Hub (or other device that is capable of doing so).
