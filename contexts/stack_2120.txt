Is it possible to get a hole in one on hole 18 on the Garden course? Is there any way to get a Hole in One on Hole 18, of the Garden Course in minigolf in Tower Unite? I've looked all over and I cant find anything that would help me out here. I know it's possible, because you end up right next to the hole. Any help would be appreciated.
