Movie where a blind girl has three guys trying to kill her, shoots them with revolver after sensing them I remember watching a movie where a young girl (16-21 probably) is blind. Even though I don't remember the whole movie the ending of the movie was that there's a house where the final scene takes place and there are three guys trying to kill her.I think she is left upstairs and these guys come searching for her. Luckily, she has a revolver and tries to shoot them, but runs out of bullets and starts loading it. After reloading, she manages to shoot each of them after identifying them through some echolocation technique or some other technique that blind people use. I watched it between 2008-2011. On TV. It was in English.
