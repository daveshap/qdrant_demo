VIRIDIANA: Yes, Uncle. How are you?
DON JAIME: I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
VIRIDIANA: Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
DON JAIME: You'll think you're still at the convent.
DON JAIME: How long are you staying?
VIRIDIANA: A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
DON JAIME: Was that difficult to get?
VIRIDIANA: No. Mother Superior told me to come.

DON JAIME: You have no feelings toward ...
VIRIDIANA: No.
