LASZLO: Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
RICK: Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
LASZLO: I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
RICK: Keep it. You'll need it in America.
LASZLO: But we made a deal.
RICK: Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
LASZLO: No. It's all arranged.
RICK: Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
