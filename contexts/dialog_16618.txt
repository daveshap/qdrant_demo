DR. ALLEN: Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable. I am a fan.
PETER: Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
DR. ALLEN: When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
PETER: My secretary?
DR. ALLEN: You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
PETER: No, I wasn't, actually.
DR. ALLEN: You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care. And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose. No brain wave activity at all.
PETER: So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
DR. ALLEN: Of course not. They put him through severe mental stress. Causing this aneurysm.
MAYA: Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
DR. ALLEN: I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
MAYA: What did you hear?
DR. ALLEN: The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
MAYA: And was he in distress when you opened the door? Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
DR. ALLEN: There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
MAYA: You heard voices, you know you did.
