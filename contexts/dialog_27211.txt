TRUMAN: Marlon--
MARLON: --Truman, what are you doing here?
TRUMAN: I've got to talk to you.
MARLON: Sorry, I'm way behind.
TRUMAN: I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
MARLON: Are you okay? You look like shit.
TRUMAN: I think I'm mixed up in something.
MARLON: <i>Mixed up?</i> Mixed up in what?
TRUMAN: There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
MARLON: No. Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
TRUMAN: I think it's got something to do with my dad.
MARLON: Your Dad?!
TRUMAN: I think he's alive. I'll tell you about it later. I'm definitely being followed.
MARLON: Who?
TRUMAN: It's hard to tell. They look just like regular people.
MARLON: How about them?
TRUMAN: Could be. Beard looks phony. It's when I'm unpredictable. They can't stand that. That's why we've got to get out of here. Can you come with me?
MARLON: I told you I can't.
TRUMAN: I've got to show you something.
