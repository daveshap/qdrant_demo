ANNIE: What happened?
CRASH: I quit. Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
ANNIE: I'm quitting too. Boys, not baseball.
CRASH: There might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
ANNIE: Salem, Massachusetts? Where all the witches were?
CRASH: Yeah...you a witch?
ANNIE: Not yet. It takes years of practice...
CRASH: You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
ANNIE: You'd be great, just great... 'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an' all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-non-time kind of time" to it..."
CRASH: Annie---
ANNIE: What?
CRASH: I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics... I don't wanta think about nothing... I just wanta be.
ANNIE: I can do that, too.
