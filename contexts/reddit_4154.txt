Was I wrong???
I've been on Bumble for over a month now and I finally got a conversation going, it's only been for a few days. Today, he asked me out on a date. I said sure and then he goes on to tell me that he went out yesterday and wanted to stay in and hang out. He wanted me to go to his house and I told him I don't feel comfortable doing that. He then suggested that we go to my house. I told him that the house situation was out and that we could possibly go out for dinner. I haven't heard anything since....

 I don't feel that it's right to have a first date at someone house and especially if you are looking for something more than a hookup. This isn't the first time I've dealt with this kind of situation. Personally, if this is how people date these days then I rather be alone. That's my home and I feel I should get to know the guy before I invite him into my home. Was I wrong for making the decision I made????
