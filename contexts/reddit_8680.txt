What are the implications of HRC's tech guy attempting to remove email addresses from emails?
Speaking of [this story](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/hillary-clinton-tech-guy-asked-reddit-for-email-advice), which has been up and down on other subreddits for the past couple days.

My questions:

1. What are the legal implications for the IT guy?
2. Does this mean anything with regard to the now-closed FBI investigation?
3. Is Clinton liable?

I apologize for asking such open-ended questions, but the only discussion that seems to be had about this elsewhere is that it's a "big deal". It seems impossible to gauge whether that's true because I don't know if laws were broken, and if so, by whom.
