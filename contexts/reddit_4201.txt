How to avoid falling for everyone...
How do you avoid putting women on a pedestal and falling for all the ones you find attractive.  
  
If a woman is attractive, I want to spend time with her and share mutual attraction, but they are never attracted, how do I detach myself from people I don't know, how do I consider them as simply other human beings whilst they seem to hold everything I never had, aka, mutual attraction.  
  
How do you avoid getting infatuated with every people you find attractive?
