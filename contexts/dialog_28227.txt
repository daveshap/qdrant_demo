MAN: You know what you just signed, Jeanne? You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion. You see? In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
JEANNE: No...
JEANNE: Please... may I have it back...
CAUCHON: You have nothing to regret...
JEANNE: I didn't mean it! I didn't know what I was signing! You tricked me...!
CAUCHON: Silence her! Take her away...!
