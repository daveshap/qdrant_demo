Do positrons annihilate in a vacuum? Seems like a stupid question as positrons only annihilate when they encounter an electron and it may be possible that they encounter an electron even in a supposedly perfect 'vacuum', however I was wondering if anyone knows of any experiments conducted on positrons in vacua or if there's any theoretical support for the idea that they annihilate spontaneously, or something like that.
