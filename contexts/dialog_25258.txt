BOB: Heard there was some excitement.
GILLIAN: Just a couple of kooks...
BOB: How're you doing?
GILLIAN: Fine. Just fine.
BOB: Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
GILLIAN: Bob... it's tearing me apart.
BOB: I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
GILLIAN: Yeah.
BOB: And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
GILLIAN: I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence. I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
GILLIAN: Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
BOB: Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
GILLIAN: Why don't I?
