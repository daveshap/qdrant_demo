My stipend just got cut by 7K and I don't know what to do...
Title pretty much says it all but I found out today my stipend is going to take a dramatic hit. I already left a 40K a year job (in a unrelated field) to come to grad school... How the hell am I supposed to tell my fiance that now I wont even be making enough to cover my loans anymore?! I just feel hopeless and am honestly thinking of telling my advisors I just cant make ends meet with 19K a year... and leaving the program. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Has anyone left because the money got cut? Any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: Iâ€™m in a STEM PhD program on the East Coast
