Defence in T-6.5 hours!
Hi guys! 

As the title says, I have my remote defence coming up shortly. I have always semi looked forward to my in person defence since my research allows some fun things to be done. I am in the field of Microbiology, and in all of the talks I’ve given, I play a card game based off my research with the audience, which I can’t do today. I was also planning to bake cookies in the shape of the system I study. These things would have helped calm me down a bit I think, since I am usually a walking bundle of nerves. 

However, one of the small perks of a remote defence is that since my seminar talk is public, I’ve now been able to invite friends from all around the world to join! My supervisor is on sabbatical on a different continent right now and so I always expected him to join online, but now I get to see people I wouldn’t normally, during my defence. 

Wish me luck!
