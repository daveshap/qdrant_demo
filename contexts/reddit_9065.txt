How legitimate are the grievances and methods of Black Lives Matter?
Black Lives Matter began as a popular hashtag after the Trayvon Martin incident, and [quickly became a national movement](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-the-black-lives-matter-movement-changed-america-one-year-later/) in the aftermath of incident at Ferguson. Although originally focused on killings of African-Americans by police across the nation, the movement's founder, Alicia Gray, has [since acknowledged](http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/10/blacklivesmatter-2/) that the movement has evolved into a more widespread protest against societal and institutional violence that targets black individuals. 

The movement has quickly entered the national consciousness, with [many referring to it](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/12/ferguson-new-civil-rights-movement-113906#ixzz3jJFDhWtx) as the new civil rights movement, and protestors using the group's slogans have staged major protests across the US in the last year. The movement has become so culturally pervasive that it has even been featured on a recent episode of *Law & Order: SVU*. 

However, the movement has faced criticism for both its goals and its tactics. The movement has [been accused of](http://nypost.com/2015/11/06/black-lives-matters-numbers-are-bogus/) fabricating death counts and other statistics, while [others worry](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2015/0913/Can-Black-Lives-Matter-and-Police-Lives-Matter-coexist-video) that the movement promotes anti-white radicalism. Additionally, the movement has been criticized for its methods, with protests [blocking roads and public spaces](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Black-Lives-Matter-Groups-Block-Oakland-Police-Headquarters-285834131.html) and [interrupting or intruding on other causes and organizations](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/bernie-sanders-event-shut-down-black-lives-matter-activists). Supporters of the movement counter that such tactics are necessary to draw attention to the issues faced by the African-American community.

My question is: how legitimate are the grievances of BLM? How bad is the problem of racial violence in the US, and are racial issues to blame for the protested social inequities, or are other factors at play? Are BLM's tactics appropriate, or do they go too far?
