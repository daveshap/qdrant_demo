3+ years unemployed Digital Media major/Journalism & Professional Writing minor. Can't even find unpaid internships.
As the title suggests, I am now entering my fourth and hopefully final year of unemployment since graduation. I currently do work a casual job at a local cinema, and have come VERY close to three different full-time job positions (lost to just one candidate in all three occasions).

On the side I create film content that has premiered at festivals and produced many contacts, but ultimately none of them have led anywhere.

After another run of about 10 rejected applications in the last batch, numerous resume updates, and otherwise complete radio silence in my job search, I'm starting to lose hope. Graduates who studied the exact same degree as myself, have left university immediately into positions, even the years behind me, and none of my other friends in my degree seemed to have the trouble I do.

Recently I even began reaching out to companies to offer myself as an intern, and those have been met with either complete silence or "no's", suggesting I can't even work for free.

I feel lost, stuck and increasingly useless as my very relevant and practical skills, seem to be going to complete waste and being overlooked.

How do I project myself more into employer's radars? How do I stand out?
