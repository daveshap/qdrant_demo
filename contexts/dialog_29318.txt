EVERETT: Richter! Call from Cohaagen.
RICHTER: This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
COHAAGEN: Stop fighting and get out.
RICHTER: They've got Quaid! They're protecting him!
COHAAGEN: Perfect!...Get out of Sector G. Now. Don't think. Do it.
RICHTER: Yes, sir.
RICHTER: Pull them out.
EVERETT: O.K., everybody pull out!
MELINA: The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
QUAID: I saw them.
BENNY: And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
MELINA: But maybe you can change all that.
BENNY: I think my grampa might be here.
QUAID: What can I do?
MELINA: Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
QUAID: Like what?
MELINA: All sorts of things. You might even remember you loved me.
QUAID: I don't need Kuato for that.
MELINA: Oh, since when?
