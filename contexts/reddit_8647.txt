What are the consequences of the Senate repealing H.J. Res 111 (consumer protections)?
[Tonight the Senate, with Mike Pence casting a tie-breaker vote, voted to repeal the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau arbitration rule](https://twitter.com/i/moments/923015620089626624) that allows consumers to band together to sue banks or credit card companies.

Initially, this seems to be a major blow for consumers trying to litigate against companies such as Equifax or Wells Fargo in the aftermath of major financial scandals.

My questions are:

1. Why would the GOP want to repeal this law? 
2. What benefits (if any) are there to consumers with this repealed?
3. What are the realistic consequences of this rule being repealed? What does it mean for consumers and financial institutions?
