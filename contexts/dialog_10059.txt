BILL: Trouble?
ALICE: Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
JACK: Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
NED: God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
JACK: Give me a hand?
BILL: For sure.
BILL: This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
JACK: Here we go.
