PHONE VOICE: Is it done?
GREGOR: It's done.
PHONE VOICE: Gregor, is that you?
GREGOR: Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
PHONE VOICE: It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
GREGOR: I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
PHONE VOICE: So what do we do?
GREGOR: What I do is none of your concern. What you should do is wait for my next phone call. I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor. When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
SAM: What's going on?
VINCENT: You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened. This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody... Including you...
SAM: I came up here to sneak a smoke.
VINCENT: You were smoking?
SAM: I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
VINCENT: Please, help yourself. Smoke as many you'd like.
SAM: I borrowed that, too...
VINCENT: Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
SAM: I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
