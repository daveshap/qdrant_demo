If you are a US citizen who has benefited from the CARES Act ($1200 stimulus check, extra UI benefits, eviction freeze, etc), then please contact the Senate and urge them to act NOW.
I attempted to post this thread on PF, but it was removed, so I am reposting it here as I think that many readers here are affected.

The US Congress passed H.R.6800, also known as the HEROES Act, on May 15, 2020, but it is currently being stalled by the Senate. This bill is very similar to the CARES Act, but it expands the pool of eligible recipients of a second round of stimulus payments (including full-time students under the age of 24 as dependents) and requires that private student loan lenders offer the same forgiveness and repayment terms as federal student loans. The bill also includes $200 billion budgeted for hazard pay for essential workers.

Millions of Americans are still unemployed and may not be able to find work for awhile, especially given that COVID-19 cases are increasing in many areas of the country. The expanded unemployment benefits of $600/week are set to expire on July 31, 2020. This expanded benefit has been a lifeline for many people and losing it would be financially devastating.

Please contact your US Senator and urge that to take action as soon as possible. Our government representatives need to prioritize helping Americans get through this pandemic and the resulting recession.
