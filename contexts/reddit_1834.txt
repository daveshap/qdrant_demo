I just got into the scholarship program of my dream

Full-Tuition + $16,800 living Expenses yearly + $3,000 study Abroad Program + an incredibly community of Alumni


As a broke international student withouth any parental support, this is literally a dream come true. At a point I thought that I wasn't even going to go to college. 

I can't thank the /r/A2C community enough. 

My school literally doesn't have a college counselor because so many of us fail to even graduate high school, and navigating this whole American college process withouth a counselor was something I never thought I could do. I could barely afford taking one SAT test, let alone expensive private counselling.

 But people here like /u/admissionsmom , /u/scholargrade and /u/williamthereader and all the other amazing posts and help have really made it possible.

You all have been my college counselor, i love this community so much.
