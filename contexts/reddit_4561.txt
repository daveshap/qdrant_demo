In this moment...
Right now, in this moment, I feel for the first time in 7 years that I might be able to survive. I might be able to live as an adult in this world. I’ll have to keep working so fucking hard to live with my mental illness, but maybe, just maybe, I can do that. Maybe someday I will be happy and want to live. Maybe someday I will be able to put aside this belief that nothing exists and nothing matters and just live for the sake of living. Maybe I will find love, maybe I will get a job, maybe I will get my license, maybe I will get a peaceful night of sleep.

This hopeful feeling isn’t going to last, but I want to get it down so I can look back tomorrow and remember. Maybe I can inspire someone with my words. Whoever you are, person reading this, take care of yourself. Thanks for reading.
