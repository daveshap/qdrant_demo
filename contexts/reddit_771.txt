Sex talk and stupid decisions
Re: I'm 15. I recently lost my virginity. It was at a grad party with a girl, that I'm only friends with. We were pretty drunk(I come from Denmark, its pretty normal to drink at this age here), so we just went into a bush and did it, which already is just dumb :(. Problem is everybody saw us getting out of the bush, and now everyone knows something that I resent myself for. The reason I resent myself, is because I always looked down on people who did it at parties, and I always wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about. Another problem is that I found out she kissed like 5 other guys at this party, and I hate myself for losing my v-card to a "slut". Everybody's talking now, and I feel like everyone's judging me. I can't stop this resentment of myself no matter what I try. How do I move on and how do I "damage control"?

Also, everyone I've talked to in person, also thought it was so stupid of me :(
