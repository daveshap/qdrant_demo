Should i leave my job right now ?
I am at work as i type this, i just got promoted to lead last week, went from 14.25$/hr to 16$/hr, there was 2 confirmed cases of corona in my building on march 26th and march 27th, about an hour ago i called 911 for someone on the ground with respiratory issues, ambulance came and took the person, the person works in the same department as the 2 people that are positive for corona, my entire family wants me to quit and not look back, i am on the edge right now, i talked to my boss who is currently at home and he justified it by saying that im going to end up having to go to a grocery store sooner or later and i could get it there aswell, but im not spending 60 hours a week in a grocery store seeing truck drivers from all over the us, i am on the tipping point of quitting right now, but i remember the job search and how hard it was, what should i do ?

It is worth noting that i had very severe asthma as a child, and i had pneumonia 4 years ago.

UPDATE: boss asked me to come in and sign my resignation, i told him i never resigned, i asked for time off and he refused it, im still not coming in to work tho, if they want me gone they have to fire me.
