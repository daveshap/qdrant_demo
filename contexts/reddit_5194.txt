Rejected, but encouraged to apply for other positions. Sincere or standard BS?
The supervisor called me and told me I was not chosen, but encouraged me to apply for future positions. Was she being sincere or was is just her trying to make me feel less rejected? 

I was shocked she would call to reject me instead of sending an email, so I just said thanks for the call instead of asking for feedback on why I didnâ€™t get the job.
