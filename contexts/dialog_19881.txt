WILLIAM: Right. Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
ANNA: Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
WILLIAM: Obviously. Very difficult.
WILLIAM: I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
ANNA: No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now. I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing. I seriously don't know what got in to me. I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
WILLIAM: Absolutely fine about it.
