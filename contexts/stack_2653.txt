Finding area of three overlaying rasters in ArcMap? I have to find the area of three overlaying rasters which are DEM,LULC and Total Evapotranspiration at the same time so that I can find the landuse landcover area and evapotranspiration of land at a particular elevation.I have used Tabulate area when just 2 of these overlaying rasters come but don't know which tool to use when three rasters are coming at the same time.
