BARTON: Milo?
MILO: Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
BARTON: Have a seat.
BARTON: What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
MILO: I am. I am, sir.
BARTON: Milo?
MILO: My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
BARTON: My goodness.
MILO: It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
BARTON: If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
MILO: I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
BARTON: Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
MILO: 'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
BARTON: And Outpost? You're happy there?
MILO: Yes sir.
PHIL: 'Didn't mention he was going to the Justice Department?
ALICE: No.
PHIL: Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
ALICE: He'll tell me when he gets home.
PHIL: That'll be a test, won't it?
ALICE: Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
PHIL: Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
ALICE: Prick.
ALICE: It's almost nine, I've been so worried! What did you see in there?
MILO: Nothing.
ALICE: Nothing?
MILO: It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
ALICE: ...Why?
MILO: Remember Lyle Barton?
MILO: The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
ALICE: I remember.
MILO: After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
ALICE: Guilt?
MILO: If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
ALICE: Poor baby. You know that's not true.
