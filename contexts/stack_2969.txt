Pilot-Wave vs. Quantum Mechanics vs. String Theory I wanted to know that are the main shortcomings of contemporary Pilot-Wave theory which is holding it back from dominating physics departments? To what extent is the facukty biase, do you think, influencing Pilot-Wave emergence? Furthermore, Is string theory still being debated? If yes, then how has the physics community overcame its unempiricality? Is it solely because of its elegent mathematics or the the philosophic tendencies of the vehement scholars backing it?
