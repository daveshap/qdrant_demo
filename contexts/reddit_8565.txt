Does British PM May have the power to cancel or delay the Brexit vote scheduled for tomorrow?
Today the PM's office has said [that they are "deferring" the vote](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46509288) which had been scheduled for tomorrow on accepting the EU withdrawal agreement.  

However, as noted in that BBC article, the Speaker of the House of Commons, Mr. Bercow, has "called on the government" to give MPs a vote on whether to delay.

Is it within the power of the PM or government to unilaterally delay a vote generally?  Does it matter that it is legislation they have proposed?  Does this in any way draw parallels from Canada's [2008 prorogation crisis?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Canadian_parliamentary_dispute)
