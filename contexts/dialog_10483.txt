TOMMY: No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
CHILI: That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
TOMMY: In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
