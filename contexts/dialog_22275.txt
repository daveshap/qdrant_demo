MICKEY: Respect, I always dished ya respect.
ROCKY: ...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
MICKEY: I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
ROCKY: The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
MICKEY: Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
ROCKY: I got pain an' experience too.
MICKEY: Please, kid.
ROCKY: Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
MICKEY: If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
ROCKY: I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
MICKEY: Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
PAULIE: How ya feelin'?
ROCKY: ...Tight.
PAULIE: I got whiskey here.
ROCKY: ...No.
