MR. THOMAS: What is it, Miss Vivian?
VIVIAN: Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner. The Rex. Ever been there?
MR. THOMAS: It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
VIVIAN: Yeah, mine too. Is it like, y'know, normal?
MR. THOMAS: I think you'll find it normal enough.
VIVIAN: Will I like it?
MR. THOMAS: You'll like it fine.
VIVIAN: Okay. Thanks, Barney. You're the best.
