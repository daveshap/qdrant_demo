I wish I knew what it was like to not have anxiety
Anxiety has controlled my entire life, it controls everything. I can’t even sleep anymore, I’m always too anxious and sick to eat, I can’t even drink water without feeling like there’s poison in it. Eh I guess this was a stupid little rant but man FUCK anxiety
