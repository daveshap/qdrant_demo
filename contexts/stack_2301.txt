Is there any good way to make a completly automated watermelon/pumpkin farm in vanilla Minecraft without commands? I have been trying to create a completely automated watermelon/pumpkin farm, mainly with observer blocks. However all of my attempts so far have caused the harvesting to trigger an infinite redstone loop when the observer block detects the piston moving. Is there any good way to make an automated farm without commands that can infinitely harvest melons/pumpkins? (At least until storage runs out.)
