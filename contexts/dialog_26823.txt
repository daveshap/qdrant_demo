DICKIE: Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
MARGE: Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
DICKIE: I just woke up. I'm sorry.
MARGE: You just woke up!
DICKIE: Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
MARGE: Well, we ate everything without you.
DICKIE: We?
MARGE: Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
DICKIE: Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
RIPLEY: No, still here.
MARGE: Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
DICKIE: Is that good?
MARGE: Shut up!
RIPLEY: I'm intruding.
DICKIE: Can you mix a martini?
RIPLEY: Sure.
MARGE: I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
DICKIE: Everybody should have one talent. What's yours?
RIPLEY: Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
DICKIE: That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
RIPLEY: Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent -- The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
DICKIE: What? What's this?
RIPLEY: I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
DICKIE: Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
RIPLEY: Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
DICKIE: I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
RIPLEY: I met him in New York.
DICKIE: Marge! You've got to hear this!
MARGE: What? What?
DICKIE: Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
RIPLEY: Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
MARGE: What's going on?
DICKIE: Uncanny!
MARGE: I don't get it.
RIPLEY: Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
DICKIE: What?
RIPLEY: I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
