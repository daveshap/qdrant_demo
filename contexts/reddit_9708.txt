Need help in Higher Ed Job search
Hi all I am asking for help today because I am really at the end of my rope. I have a BA in History and two years experience working for an AmeriCorps funded college access program run thru a university. I have been applying for jobs primarily at a University which my wife will be attending as a grad student in the fall. I have applied to at least thirty jobs and received no interviews. I am at the end of my rope. I am so scared that I will have to put my whole career on hold and work retail or something. I have applied for roles as diverse as academic advising, admin assistant, and programming staff. Just unsure how to proceed...
