MIKE: You called, Doctor?
KATHRYN: Everything's going wrong. I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before. I can't get him to respond.
MIKE: How come?
KATHRYN: I don't know. I can't understand it. Something's bothering them.
MIKE: And what else is bothering you?
KATHRYN: ... Hutton. He really pisses me off.
MIKE: Yeah, you really don't like him.
KATHRYN: I don't like what he does.
MIKE: It's his work.
KATHRYN: He doesn't need the money. He inherited a fortune. He kills for kicks. TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
MIKE: Okay, forget him now. I'm going to pick up Sean. Take a ride?
KATHRYN: I can't leave now. We taking Sean out?
MIKE: Sure. Want to try that new Italian place?
KATHRYN: No, you don't need all that starch. You're getting too fat.
MIKE: Not enough loving.
KATHRYN: Get out of here!
