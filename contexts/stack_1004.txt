booting xubuntu 4 I have an HP stream 13 with 2gb ram and 30gb hard drive. Touchscreen. As this did not work at all well with windows 10 upgrade program I have reformatted and installed xubuntu 4.15.042 (I think) 6 months ago. After some upgrade link that I clicked it will not boot but leaves the screen blank with a dash - in the top left corner. The only way I can recover it is to go into the bios F10 or boot device options F9 and then escape to advanced options for Ubuntu where it shows 3 versions:<br>4.15.0-42-generic and recovery mode.<br>4.15.0-39-generic and recovery mode.<br>4.4.0-138-generic and recovery mode.<br>If I go into the recovery mode in any of the three it then reboots into my screen but then reverts to the blank screen- when switched on again after exiting.<br>What should I do?
