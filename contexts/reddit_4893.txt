Depression anger
My depression and anxiety causes me to get angry often. I am not a violent person but these situations leave me with the feeling of wanting to hit or break something (only things, never people). Only there is nothing around that I could damage without causing further problems. Does this happen to anyone else? How do I handle this? It is happening more and more often?
