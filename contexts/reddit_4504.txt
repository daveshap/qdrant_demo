I’m so scared right now, I wish someone would hold my hand and tell me it’ll all be ok.
All hell will break lose tomorrow when I go to school for the last time in at least 2 weeks. I will have no clinician or therapist for the next 2 weeks at least. My mental health will cripple most likely, and I’ll seriously have no help. I’m so scared. Our school is being shut down because of the virus, and it won’t be fun, it won’t be like a vacation. I’ll be alone, and I’m so afraid. I’m trying to plan, come up with things I can do. Sew, draw and read to name a few. But I’m still so scared. I can’t do anything. Tomorrow I’m going to hug all my teachers goodbye, even though I probably shouldn’t. I’m scared for the people who are dying and are sick. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what I will do. I’m so scared. I just needed to let this out. Thank you, if you read.
