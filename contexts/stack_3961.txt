Setting up a statistical analysis comparing two groups adjusted for age and twins I'm investigating if there is a difference in volume of a specific brain region (T1 weighted MR scans) when comparing Migraneurs with aura to healthy controls. I would like to adjust for age and the fact that i have twin pairs in the Migraneurs group. I've thought about creating a linear mixed effect model, but I lack experience using these models. Can anybody help me on the way? Would it be possible to solve this problem using simple t-tests?Btw. I'm mainly using matlab and I have several other parameters such as blood pressure, smoking, number of migraine attacks and so forward that I would like to add to the model (next step).
