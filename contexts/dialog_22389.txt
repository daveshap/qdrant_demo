SAM: You think you can stitch me up on you own?
JEAN-PIERRE: Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
SAM: Then if you don't mind... I'm gonna pass out.
JEAN-PIERRE: He's tough, your American friend.
VINCENT: Yes, Sam's tough alright.
JEAN-PIERRE: And you respect him.
VINCENT: Of course. Don't you?
JEAN-PIERRE: I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through. He's a cop?
VINCENT: Not exactly.
JEAN-PIERRE: Not exactly? But close enough, eh? So he saved your life, then?
VINCENT: How did you know?
JEAN-PIERRE: If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
