Mixed shrooms, wax edibles, and 2-liter of Sunkist; never been the same since... help?
Two years ago, I was depressed because my best friend did not like me the way I loved her. I decided that night to mix the remaining drugs I had to see if I could enjoy the rest of my night. Big mistake. I felt a feeling so bizarre and horrifying; I faced reality and myself(I). I had to battle several delusions about the universe, who I was, if heaven and hell existed, and I was able to best most of them and got better over the year, but I have never been the same since then. I constantly think about reality and the experienced/observer of it, and briefly had night terror episodes where I’d have this intense pressure in my right ear and wouldn’t be able to move and I’d float out of my body. Sometimes, I have these panic attacks where I know I’m about to think about the unsolvable questions and I can’t stop it. I want to go back to the way I was, I didn’t know that this would happen to me. I’m fine on the outside and manage these things well, but I have no idea if I’ve forsaken myself forever. Thinking about all of these deep questions hurts me. Love any advice from anyone, I know I’m not alone, but whenever these thoughts and weirdness happen, I feel very isolated and everyone seems fake/asleep
