DAVID LEE: You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
MRS. BOATWRIGHT: No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
DAVID LEE: But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
MRS. BOATWRIGHT: If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
DAVID LEE: But, Miss Boatwright, you--
MRS. BOATWRIGHT: I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
MRS. BOATWRIGHT: Come, I'll take you home.
DAVID LEE: I'll walk...
MRS. BOATWRIGHT: Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
DAVID LEE: I'm used to it.
