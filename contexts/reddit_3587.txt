People I'm attracted to don't want me. People I'm not attracted to want to marry me.
I don't know what I did in my past life to deserve this foolishness.

For some unknown reason, I seem to have  very specific "types" for men and women. Both of these types make my heart flutter and my knees weak. Both of these types also prefer the LITERAL OPPOSITE of me. I wish I was exaggerating. Not only are they not attracted to me; I'm the polar contrast of what they're into. This has been the case every single time.

However, other people seem to have me as their exact type. This would make me happy as a clam if I felt even the slightest hint of attraction for them. I couldn't date or sleep with them if I tried because there really is no desire on my end. 

Can anyone else relate to this? Feeling like I'm pretty much destined to be alone.
