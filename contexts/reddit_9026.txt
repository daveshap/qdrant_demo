Happy belated 75k subs, NeutralPolitics! To celebrate: an all-week AMA with the NeutralPolitics mod team!
Hello Neutrons!

How the numbers have grown! Over the last 12 months, we've gone from barely 40,000 to over 75,000 subscribers, opened up /r/NeutralTalk and /r/NeutralNews, and gone through quite a lot of changes in our community. And we're all excited for what the future will bring.

For the next week, Monday the 11th through Friday the 15th, this thread will remain stickied and open to any and all questions from you, the users! We'll do our best to answer anything, within reason, you ask us within that time period.

**We are the moderators of NeutralPolitics, AMA!**
