SCRATCH: Mr. Webster, I presume?
WEBSTER: Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
SCRATCH: Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
WEBSTER: Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself.
SCRATCH: It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
WEBSTER: Me?
SCRATCH: Oh .. not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
WEBSTER: There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy.
SCRATCH: Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster! Cup for cup -- what do you say?
WEBSTER: Cup for cup!
SCRATCH: Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
JABEZ: About what?
SCRATCH: Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
JABEZ: Never!
DANIEL: Mama!
MARY: Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
DANIEL: I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
MARY: All right, darling.
