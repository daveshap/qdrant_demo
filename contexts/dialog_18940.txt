VADA: What happened to Shelly?
HARRY: She just had a baby that's all.
VADA: We have a baby?
HARRY: Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
VADA: Can I see him?
HARRY: You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
VADA: Shelly?
SHELLY: Hey! Oh look.
VADA: He's so tiny.
SHELLY: I know, look at his little hands.
HARRY: I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
SHELLY: I was pushing as fast as I could.
VADA: Did it hurt a lot?
SHELLY: You have no idea.
