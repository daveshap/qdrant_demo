Am I overreacting or was I actually sexually harassed?
So first of all, I'm a guy. 

Here's the story:

End of last semester, beginning of summer. I go over to my friend's house to hang out, his neighbors are there. I guess I will call the P and N. So they are pretty drunk, and my friend T is hooking up with N. Sooner or later, P asks me to hook up with her, and I decline politely. I was not attracted to her in least as far as looks or personality. 

Eventually I fall asleep when things quiet down a little, and before I know it, I wake up to her kissing my mouth. I left because it made me pretty damn uncomfortable and honestly I was offended. 

Well P and N came back tonight to visit, and I went over to hang out with my friend T and his roommates, not knowing she was there. I immediately left without acknowledging P or N, and immediately I got texts asking what was wrong. I told T's roommate what happened and he said it wasn't a big deal, I was blowing it out of proportion, etc. and that I was being rude but honestly it made me very upset seeing her again. 

It's not like I'm afraid of girls or anything, I am usually open to trying new things and giving girl's I'm not necessarily attracted to the benefit of the doubt, but there is a clear line drawn when I say no. 

Am I overreacting? Are T and his roommates right?
