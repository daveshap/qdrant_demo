i think my boyfriend might be into someone else what should i do?
alright, first thing first, everytime i see him i always look like shit, maybe once or twice i actually looks presentable, but other than that i looked like a ferret (she never does...), but he seemed to enjoy my company, yknow? we did fun things like tickle fights or wrestling, etc,etc, but lately i noticed he hasn't really been into me all that much, i mean on facebook(its one of our only means of communication since we were caught making out on my bed and he was practically banned from my life by my step dad whos some ex drug addict and looks at me weird), he added this girl that i KNEW liked him and they seemed to always talk, and now, these days, every time i try to talk with him or tease him on msgs or status updates he ignores it or just says something irrelevant like 'derp' or 'whelp'
It makes me tear up inside and i start to wonder if maybe he was starting to loose interest in me because when they talk he always smiles and acts how he usually acts back when I was amusing (which was not that long ago... well it stopped when she came along) 
we use to make out every chance we had, but since the last i saw him when i tried to kiss him he'd do it quick and would pull away and pat me on the back and give me this weird half assed smile...
since he started showing interest in him ive gone into a huge mess of stress (still going through it ) where i stopped eating and stopped working out or caring about the way i looked and when we talk it just makes me feel worse and worse, i just want to confront him and ask him to limit his attention towards that girl, but at the same time i dont, because i dont want to seem like the jealous type, like my mom who yelled at my step for having an old friend from highschool on his facebook and beating him down for every chick who talks to him.

i dont know wether i should leave him or just deal with it and see how it turns out (she might take him if i do that though...) or if i should confront him about this mess and we'd have this huge make out session, but at the same time if i do that he's gunna think i dont trust him which i do! also everytime im around him i always feel so nervous to the point where im saying stupid stuff like corny jokes or awkward laughing or lately a need to be alone to get rid of the empty feeling in the back of my throat and dropped stomach...
