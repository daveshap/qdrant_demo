Is it possible to put the projection of a map of a layout in a text label in a layout in QGIS? I would like to be able to have a text label in a print designer with the information of the projection of a map in QGIS. That way, if I change the projection of a project, I would change that information within the layout.I think I've seen a variable map_src, but I can not find a way to use it.
