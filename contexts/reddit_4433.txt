Just have no energy to do anything all day every day and feel empty
I’m so depressed to the point where I just feel empty. I don’t do anything any more. Just sit in my room mainly. I have exams currently and I can’t study for more than 20 minutes without taking a 4 hour break. Any task that I need to do is dwelled over for hours on end before actually being done. I don’t have any courage, any willpower, any energy whatsoever. I feel lost and don’t know how I can stop being like this. There’s so much other stuff wrong with me I haven’t said here. I’ve also thought about suicide quite a bit. Doubt I’d actually follow through with it, but the thoughts are there.

Edit: I really appreciate all the replies so far - thanks
