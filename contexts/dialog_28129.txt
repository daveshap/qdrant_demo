EMILY: There’ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it’s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
LOMBARD: I wouldn’t mind. Thank you.
EMILY: A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard. I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
LOMBARD: Hah... What about Nathalie?
EMILY: No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
LOMBARD: I’m sure I’ll find a way.
EMILY: Like you’ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
LOMBARD: Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
EMILY: How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do. What am I really looking at here, huh? Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
LOMBARD: Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
