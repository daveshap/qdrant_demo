CARLA: Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
DANNY: Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
CARLA: I don't know. I just want to try it.
DANNY: Shit... Did you talk to your mother today?
CARLA: No. What are you looking for?
DANNY: Nothing. Why are you doing this? I thought God didn't exist.
CARLA: He commands it whether He exists or not... Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
DANNY: And be crushed.
CARLA: Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
CARLA: Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
DANNY: You eat first, then you light. Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
