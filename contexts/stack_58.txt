How to edit the Plist so as to remove all reference to wireless cards and drivers if it involves no risks? I need to start a new, totally new wireless config.  My 17\" MBP 4,1(1261) wireless died. Card removed was 3 wire but new one has only 2.  ifixit.com says connect black, then blue, and grey does not get connected. El Capitan does not see that card at all even after resets of all 3 types with battery out.  Since, I've used at least 3 different USB adapters; now, I just want to start clean.  And this OS install was a clean install on to a 1 TB SSD which runs fast with the full 6GB RAM.
