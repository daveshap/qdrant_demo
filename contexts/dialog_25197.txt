KIRK: Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
MORROW: Now wait a minute! This business about Spock and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
KIRK: Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
MORROW: Yours...?!
KIRK: As surely as if it were my own! Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
MORROW: No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
KIRK: Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
MORROW: Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
KIRK: Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
