POLITICIAN: None too discreet, is he?
WELLES: No, sir, he is not.
POLITICIAN: He's an imbecile. I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
WELLES: The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
POLITICIAN: Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
WELLES: Certainly, Senator. If I can ever be of further assistance.
AMY: You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
WELLES: Sure. I'll call the guy.
AMY: You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
WELLES: I'm not using him again for anything. He was worthless. You have bridge here Saturday?
AMY: Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
