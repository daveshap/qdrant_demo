Has anyone ever tried to physically attack any of the Endless? There is one thing that always bothered me a bit in the \"Sandman\"/\"Vertigo\" universe: whenever one of the Endless shows up and introduces itself, people immediately assume that they are indeed what they say they are (Death, Dream, Desire etc).But imagine a situation: A thug goes drunk from a pub, gets hit by a car and then he sees a woman telling him that \"she is Death and he has to follow her\". I definitely can imagine, that there would be situations, when the recently deceased would say \"the hell I am!\" and try to take a swing at the short, goth chick.Has similar thing ever happened? I don't recall anything like this in the \"Sandman\" itself, but Death and Daniel (the new Dream) were present in many other DC comics.EDIT: Just to be clear: by attack I mean \"intend to kill, seriously harm or disable by using physical force\". So attempts to grope Desire*, half-hearted slaps and using magic/non-physical superpowers (like telekinesis) won't count. I've read it in a novel set in Sandman's world, where woman imprisoned by Desire tries to hug him/her\just to be gently pushed away
