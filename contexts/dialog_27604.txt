HARRY: Wait'll you see the inside!
LUKE: Can't wait.
HARRY: We've been closed for a while.
LUKE: Ah.
LUKE: Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
HARRY: Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
LUKE: Why?
HARRY: Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess. Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco. Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to."
LUKE: Didn't you have any help?
HARRY: Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up. Broke mine, too. But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure. C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
