How to get calendar invites to come in as iCal and not as Google Calendar invites? I use my Gmail email-address as my Apple ID. When people send me calendar invites, I only receive them on Google Calendar. And since I deactivated the calendar on my Macs for Gmail account, I don't get notified at all (besides an email).Is there a way to receive the invitations on iCal instead? Or do I have to use a non-Google address as my Apple ID?
