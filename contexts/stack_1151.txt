Oracle SQL: How to give user the permissions to SELECT from a table? I'm not very familiar with Oracle SQL at all, but using our admin account I ran the following query on our Oracle database server: GRANT SELECT ON Table1 TO OtherUser. I then committed this change (not sure if you need to even commit this?)I'm using Oracle SQL Developer to connect to our Oracle database and after I ran the above GRANT statement from our admin account, I would've thought I would see Table1 listed under the Table objects node when I connect as OtherUser, but I do not see it and cannot select from it when I try.Is there any other permissions I need to grant, or anything else I need to do that I missed?Edit: When I query DBA_TAB_PRIVS I do see Table1 listed with the SELECT privilege for grantee OtherUser, even though from OtherUser's perspective I can't see Table1 under the Tables node in Oracle SQL Developer.
