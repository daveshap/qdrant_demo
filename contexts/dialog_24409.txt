DUPREE: ...I forgive you Darwin.
DARWIN TREMOR: Shoot, I appreciate that man.
DUPREE: If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
DARWIN TREMOR: You woulda?
DUPREE: Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
DARWIN TREMOR: Damn... alright then.
DUPREE: I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
DARWIN TREMOR: Really?
DUPREE: I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
DARWIN TREMOR: Man, that's great.
DUPREE: I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
DARWIN TREMOR: You think so?
