Stuck with ramen for a couple days and have less than 5$ ? Buy a carton of eggs and a bag mixed veggies and add them to your pot of boiling water!
i've been doing this for awhile and the difference it makes is crazy. i literally just finished a bowl of mixed broccoli, carrots, 2 eggs, and a pack of ramen and i'm actually full. i'm a 6'1 180 pound man as well, and payday isn't for a couple days. Put the veggies in when you put the water on to boil, then add the egg when you put the ramen in!

i call it poor mans soup but i'm sure it has an official name somewhere haha! don't be afraid to experiment as well!
