Lost Partition After Installing Ubuntu 16.04 I used to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu on my previous laptop and everything worked just fine. I got a new 500gb HP Laptop and after installing Ubuntu, I realized that about 100gb was missing. Ubuntu is allocated to 114gb and Windows is allocated to 256gb. I have no idea where the other space went to and I want to know if it can be recovered.
