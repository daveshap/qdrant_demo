Boss is asking me for a copy of a trespass order?
Hi,  


My boss is very invasive and is constantly pushing and prying into my personal life. It's just a low-end retail job. She was 'requiring' me to publicly post my name and photo on the company's website. For my own safety, I refused. I have a stalker and take my privacy and anonymity seriously.   
Now my boss wants me to give a copy of the trespass order I have against my stalker. It isn't a restraining order, it protects me at home. I feel she's being unreasonable and she wants me to figure out how to get this several-year-old document. All I have is a business card with a number to give in case he ever shows up on my property-- not at work.  


Help with dealing with this lady?
