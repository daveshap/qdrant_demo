I just don't have the energy to socialize with people
I'm so fucking tired. I'm tired of my job, my home life, myself. I'm so exhausted all the time that socializing with a group of people is way too much work and it's so fucking emotionally draining.

It doesn't matter how much someone wants to hang out, I cannot and will not hang with them because it's so fucking miserable for me. I just don't feel the same enjoyment other people do during group hangouts. It feels like a chore. I feel nothing and everything all at once. How hard is it for someone to take the hint that someone else just isn't in the right mindset to be social???? It's so fucking difficult and not a lot of people understand that.
