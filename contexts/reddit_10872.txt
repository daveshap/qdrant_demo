My sister told me to kill myself
My sister and I used to be best friends. But I noticed as when she grew older, she started to develop a "grudge" against me. She got angry at me more easily, and would stay in her room all day and never speak to anyone. I tried to connect with her because I still loved her, but she would shut me out of her life. And because of this, my sister and I haven't spoken to each other in three months.

My sister was up at 4:00 am today and I couldn't sleep so I went to her room and told her to go to bed. She started yelling at me while mom heard her, and went upstairs. As soon as she reached her room, she turned off the light at the last minute and went to bed.

Five minutes after that happened, I heard a voice in the dark say, "I hate you. I wish you would die. Go kill yourself."

I realized that it was coming from my sister's room. I got up and said, "What? What did you just say?"

"I hate you. I wish you would kill yourself. Just die already."

I didn't know why she was saying this, so I started crying and went downstairs. My heart felt like it was being shattered into pieces and my chest felt heavy.

I told my parents everything, and my mom went upstairs again to confront her. My dad stayed with me, and held me as I cried. He said that he was very disappointed at her (even though she was his favorite).

Mom came back downstairs again and told me that she was going to apologize to me in the morning.

She never did. In fact, she pretended that *nothing* ever happened. She pretended that I didn't even exist. She was happy.

The worst part, was how my sister *knew* I was suicidal. Back when she was "nice", I told her about my feelings and how I wanted to kill myself, and she shared my sympathy. Now, she shames me because of it. She shames me for being depressed and tells me that I was a mistake and blames me for my parents' suffering. She told me that I was their least favorite child and that she was their favorite. She told me that she hated me everyday.

This morning, I tried to hang myself with my dad's belt, but I failed.

Now I have to wake up everyday, knowing the fact that my sister is truly gone.
