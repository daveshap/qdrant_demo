ALICE: A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
LITTLE BILL: Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
ALICE: But what they done, they...
SKINNY: Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
LITTLE BILL: No?
SKINNY: This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
LITTLE BILL: Property.
SKINNY: Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
LITTLE BILL: You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
SKINNY: Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
SKINNY: She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
LITTLE BILL: You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
