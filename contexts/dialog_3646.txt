SANDY: What happened to your face?
RAE: Got in a little accident.
SANDY: Yeah.
RAE: Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
SANDY: You need money again?
RAE: No. That's not why... Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
SANDY: You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
RAE: Yeah. I know I did. But... I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
SANDY: I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
RAE: I just wanted some make-up.
SANDY: All that shit's on aisle 5.
RAE: I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
SANDY: The hell are you talkin' about?
RAE: Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma. I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me. And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
RAE: I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
SANDY: All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
RAE: But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
SANDY: Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
