Desperate for advice
How do I even start this post... I guess with the fact that I am absolutely desperate for advice. I am a Masterâ€™s student in the field of ecology currently trying to finish up my thesis on edge effects. However, I am nearing the deadline for when my whole paper is due (11/1) and I do not have a proper discussion written. I also keep making stupid editing mistakes and I can tell my advisor is fed up with me. If I do not draft a great discussion, my advisor will not let me defend this semester. I need to get out. So, I am practically begging, **what makes a good discussion? What are your writing tips? How can I make this discussion section of my paper perfect on the first draft? **

I have a draft written, but I feel like I am rambling and speculating about my results and that it all means nothing. 

TL;DR: Please help me, what makes a good discussion section?
