SHELLY: Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
HARRY: I know that, but what do you want from me?
SHELLY: Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
HARRY: Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
SHELLY: I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
