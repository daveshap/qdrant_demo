30yrs old and applied for my first Uni!
After many attempts at college  (since the age of 16) I finally got my shit together and am graduating with my Associates this year. Last night I decided to apply for my first university to transfer to Fall 2020. It is out of state so no guaranteed admissions. Fingers crossed!! 

Just wanted to tell someone.
