Find out Browser's AES generated key on SSL/TLS When it comes to TLS handshakes. first of all I'm wondering how the AES keys which are responsible for encrypting data is generated? is it generated randomly on the browser and it's securely sent to HTTPS server or server is responsible for generating those keys? Secondly is there any way to actually find out those AES keys which browser(for example Chrome) uses for encrypting data (after SSL/TLS authentication successfully handled)?
