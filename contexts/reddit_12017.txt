Our engagement is leading us to misery.
I pray that next year when the ball drops, I not be as miserable as I have been these past three months. 

My fianc√© left me last fall. He returned a week later, and we've been working on our relationship for the past three months. 

I was fully on board with marrying him before this went down - hell, I proposed. But since he returned, I have not been the same. I've been less tolerant of him walking over me. I've been standing up for myself. I cared about myself as much as I cared about him. 

The thought of even setting a year to get married in is enough to throw me into a tailspin. Reddit, I love him, but I cannot marry him. I'm 22, been with him for three years and nothing good has come of my sacrificing for him. I paid 80% of the bills and set my life for him for him to utter blow it all up in my face... and make me realize that I can do better. 

I have come to the realization to say "yes" to him is to say "no" to a hypothetical other (or if I'd stay single, then a "no" to Me Myself and I).

I'm horrified of what would happen if I ended our relationship for good. I love his family, and his family loves me. My family loves him too. My family has experienced separations a million times worse than this... but I'm putting myself on an unrealistic pedestal. I want the perfect carefree life... but that's not life. Life is hard choices. 

Reddit, I'm terrified. I want to wake up tomorrow in a different life. So far away from here. I need help making an adult decision when I'm barely an adult. Help me help myself.
