NEO: Goddamnit! I don't believe this is happening!
TANK: Neo, this has to be done!
NEO: Does it? I don't know. This can't be just coincidence. It can't be! Can it?
TANK: What are you talking about?
NEO: The Oracle. She told me this would happen. She told me...
NEO: That I would have to make a choice...
TRINITY: What choice?
TRINITY: What are you doing?
NEO: I'm going in after him.
TRINITY: You can't!
NEO: I have to.
TRINITY: Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out! There's no way you're going back in!
NEO: Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
TRINITY: What?
NEO: I'm not the One, Trinity. The Oracle hit me with that too.
TRINITY: No, you... have to be.
NEO: I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy. Morpheus is the one that matters.
TRINITY: No, Neo. That's not true. It can't be true.
NEO: Why?
TRINITY: Because...
TANK: Neo, this is loco. They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building. Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. Three of them! I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
NEO: I know that's what it looks like, but it's not. I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed. I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
TANK: Why?
NEO: Because I believe in something.
TRINITY: What?
NEO: I believe I can bring him back.
NEO: What are you doing?
TRINITY: I'm coming with you.
NEO: No, you're not.
TRINITY: No? Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you. I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
