Worked for a local small business for two months and I think they're already trying to get rid of me.
I recently got hired part-time at a local small business along with a few others. I enjoy working there, but from the beginning, some things seemed a little bit shady. 
I'm a young adult trying to save enough to be self-sufficient. I pay for most of my expenses already. When I first interviewed the manager stated I would work ten to fifteen hours a week. While the small amount of hours and pay would make living more difficult, I agreed. I'd just cut back on unnecessary spending. 




So for the first two weeks, aside from one day of training, they never scheduled me, then gave me one four-hour shift in the next two weeks. Since then they've only been giving me eight or nine hours a week. I got my paycheck, and there was no training wage in it. I thought that was odd, but decided to wait and see if the mistake would be resolved the next check. It hasn't, and on top of that, it says I've only worked eight hours this whole year when I know I 've worked more. 




There's a lot of other weirdness too. I applied to be a cashier but they don't let me use the cash register. When they say they need people to cover shifts, when I volunteer, they suddenly don't need anyone. I just got a text from the manager telling me and a few other workers that we suck (her words.) I work hard and while my personality isn't all bubbly and bombastic, I'm friendly. I'm going to wait a few more weeks and see if the weirdness all resolves itself, but I can't shake the feeling that they don't really want me. I don't know if this is normal for working part-time in California, and I'm afraid other places would be worse. I just don't know.


TL;DR Got a job, got way fewer hours than I was told, no apparent training wage, not allowed to use the cash register despite being a cashier, and boss suddenly got kinda mean.
