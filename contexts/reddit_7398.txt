Should I pause my PhD during the pandemic?
I know, I know: talk to your department/PI/whatever. I'm in continued discussions with them but want to hear what other people are doing too. 

If you're an international student stuck overseas, or someone who really can't do research from home, which have you picked?

My options are,

**Continuing PhD by distance**

 - I'm a computational astrophysicist without a proper computer, so it's basically like a lab scientist without their lab

 - I can do literature review, but for 12-18 months??? This is a 3-year degree. 

 - Eats into my total funded period, even with a 6-month extension

 - I graduate on time (2023-4)

 - Less competitive at graduation due to time overseas

 - My return date is dictated by when my country's travel ban is lifted, which won't be until 2021. Uni may open before that. (Apparently the requirement to open travel is for countries to have "zero or near zero cases of COVID-19", which is just not happening in the UK) 

 - Have to work alone due to time difference. Not even group meetings. 

**Intermit (i.e pause) PhD**

 - No more stress

 - Nothing to occupy my time

 - Funding stops

 - Visa invalid

 - Can't travel back to uni until Oct 2021 (due to housing)

 - Can only intermit for 3 terms (i.e. 6 months) continuously, which is... Oct *2020*
