Does anyone else constantly feel like they’ve done something wrong after social interactions?
Basically the title. I constantly feel like I’ve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends. Even if the interactions ended positively and with hugs goodbye and such. I don’t have a bad relationship with any of them. I don’t consider myself anti social. I’ve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it’s all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I’ve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they’ll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn’t worry about it, but for some reason I can’t shake the guilty feeling. Is this just me?

EDIT:  I never expected this post to get the response that it did. I want to reply to everyone, but don’t want to be a broken record either. I’m sorry you all are suffering with this as well and I hope we all find some relief someday. It really helps me to know I’m not alone in these feelings. I hope knowing you’re not alone brings you some relief as well. And I’m nobody special, but if anyone ever needs to talk or share experiences I’m here.
