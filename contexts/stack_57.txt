Using Migration Asst, have gone from Mac 1 to Mac 2, but now Mac 2 back to Mac 1? I had to send MacBook Pro #1 out for repair and used Migration Assistant to temporarily work on a loaner (MacBook Pro #2).Now #1 is back. Do I:Use M.A. to go from #2 to #1, hoping it magically merges and resolves the differences in my user account existing on #1?Reformat and reinstall the OS on #1, and use M.A. to go from #2 to #1?Some other optimal solution?
