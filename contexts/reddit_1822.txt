Miracles DO Happen
I saw someone else's post on their waitlist miracle, so I wanted tell you about mine. 

I only applied to 3 schools (don't come at me lol). 1 was my dream school -- UPenn -- while the other 2 were target and safety schools. In March, I found out that I was waitlisted at Penn. After writing a LOCI (and sending it the same day I got the decision), I was informed in May that I got accepted off the waitlist.

My financial aid came in a few days after my acceptance, and once again I was disappointed because there was no way my family and I could afford it. After sending in an appeal, the financial aid office gave me more aid, but it was still not enough. 

*So I sent in another appeal...*

After waiting for two weeks and making tons of phone calls, I realized that the financial aid office did not see my second appeal. One of the counselors there eventually told me that Penn does not usually review 2nd appeals and suggested that I take out loans. However, after making a few more calls, my mom was able to contact the actual committee that was in charge of reviewing financial aid. They told my mom that they would look at my second appeal the next day and update me that evening. 

I'm happy to say that Penn gave me even more aid, making the price around **$40,000** *less* than the amount I originally had to pay. And now, Penn is even cheaper than the state school I originally committed to.

Moral of the story: 

be persistent

miracles do happen

I know some of you aren't religious, but let me say that prayer does work
