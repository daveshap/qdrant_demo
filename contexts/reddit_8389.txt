Can the President shut down the Mexican border, either partially or completely? What are the limitations of his/her power in regards to blocking entry?
On Friday, President Trump threatened to entirely [shut down the Southern Border with Mexico:](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1078625779670503426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1078625779670503426&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FPolitics%2Fpresident-trump-threatens-close-southern-border-democrats-fund%2Fstory%3Fid%3D60048020)

I have two questions:

1: Does the President have the authority to shut down a physical border, whether that is between the United States and Canada, or the United States and Mexico?

2: What are the limitations of this power: meaning, what government body can override a President's order to shut down the border, and how specific can the President fine tune their request (IE: exemptions)?
