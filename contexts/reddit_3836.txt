Lost That Loving Feeling
Anyone feel from being in a bad break up that it effects their ability to love again? Ive been single for 3 years now and in this time no one really has caught my attention. I've dated but I don't usually see someone for more than 2 months. After my breakup I focused a lot on myself and I think this has changed my mindset. I recently went to my best friend's wedding and noticed that love is something that I lack and want but I don't think I'm capable of anymore.


When I saw how they looked into each other's eyes at first made me feel like the feeling they have is something immature. Something I use to believe in but no longer. Almost like something I grew out of. It wasn't until I made the best man speech it really hit me that maybe I'm wrong. My friend was kind of the goofball friend who fell in love in college and completely changed. He's a doctor now with a wife. She changed his life and made him a better person. 


I feel that no one really excites me like how they feel. They were very fortunate to have fallen for each other at a very young age and didn't experience what I have. I  want someone I can grow with and share memories with like them. Unfortunately, these things aren't something you can just "get" but is acquired over time. I just feel maybe I'm the problem. People lacking experience usually fall in love quickly were I feel the opposite. Nothing or no one excites me. Makes me feel like cause of my past the feeling doesn't come to me anymore. Anyone else feel this way?
