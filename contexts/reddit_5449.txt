How does some one get one year experience using QuickBooks and Microsoft office software?
I have looked at office job postings on indeed that prefer or require one year experience using QuickBooks and Microsoft office software. My question is how does some one get the one year experince if none of the companys offer on the job training when it comes to using software?
