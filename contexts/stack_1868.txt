Period during which one can step away from a contractual obligation? Not a trial period.In germany - and many european countries - certain contracts have a period during which one of the signatory partners (mostly: private people) can decide that no, the contract was a bad idea and they want to step away from it.Is there an english term for this period? Working on an computer system with english documentation and - I need a decent term for this.
