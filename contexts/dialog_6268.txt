VINCENT: Let's go.
MAX: No.
VINCENT: What you mean, no?
MAX: I'm done. Find another cab.
VINCENT: Max? What are you doing?
MAX: Leave me alone.
VINCENT: Don't even think you're walking away from me.
MAX: <u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
VINCENT: Pull your head out of your ass. Get your thinking straight. You wanna die?
MAX: I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
VINCENT: Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop. I'm not playing.
MAX: Sure? Like you didn't play him? String him along? If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
LENNY: Max? Maaax. Pick up, dipshit.
VINCENT: Jesus, what is with this guy?
LENNY: Maaaaaax!
VINCENT: You hassling my driver again?
LENNY: Who is this?
VINCENT: Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
LENNY: What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
VINCENT: We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
LENNY: Nothin'! Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow! Get him on the line, please.
VINCENT: Hang on. Carefully...
MAX: Yeah?
LENNY: Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
VINCENT: Show up for what?
MAX: Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
