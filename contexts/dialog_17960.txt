DR. EDDIE: Don't worry. I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection. Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
ANDERTON: That's comforting.
DR. EDDIE: You do understand I can't just give you new irises. The scanners will read the scar tissue. Alarms will go off. Large men with guns will appear...
ANDERTON: Right. I know --
DR. EDDIE: Anesthesia. Try to relax, John. I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes. Completely.
ANDERTON: Yeah --
DR. EDDIE: And replace them with new ones.
ANDERTON: I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
DR. EDDIE: Why?
ANDERTON: Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care? They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
DR. EDDIE: Whatever you say, John.
