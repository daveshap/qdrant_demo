DECKARD: Is there anything else?
RACHAEL: I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
DECKARD: I've already got more help than I need.
RACHAEL: I think you need more help than you've got.
RACHAEL: There's two reasons a man rejects help. Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
DECKARD: Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
RACHAEL: Two of us might be more effective than one.
DECKARD: I work alone.
