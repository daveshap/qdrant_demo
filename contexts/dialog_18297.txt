MARIAN: Who is it?
MARIKA: It's Marika. Is Paula there?
MARIAN: She's at work. I'm her mother.
MARIKA: Oh. I thought today was Saturday.
MARIKA: I'm sorry. I had a wretched night.
MARIAN: Oh. You need a cappuccino.
MARIKA: And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize. Calls made at three and four in the morning. So, I called the number ... and a woman answered. And I ... I hung up. So, then I followed him. Just like in the movies. And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn. We had been going together for almost a year.
MARIAN: Men ... they're all the same. Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
MARIKA: Really?
MARIAN: Oh, it was such a big scandal.
MARIKA: What happened?
MARIAN: Poor man had to leave town. And I hear that other women came forward.
MARIAN: You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
MARIKA: What does he do?
MARIAN: He's an organic farmer.
MARIKA: Oh. Well, that would be a ... change. Thank you, Mrs. Peterson. You have a very reassuring voice.
