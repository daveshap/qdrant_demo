How does Google save authentication information in the browser? When I open Gmail in the browser, I automatically log in. I believe this is because of the previously saved cookies. If I remove cookies I need to sign in again. It means Google saves some auth keys in cookies which are never expired or in 2-3 years from now. I heard that cookies can be copy-pasted. In this way, if someone has access to the cookies, they can access your account. So the server should keep the expiry time shorter (probably a day max).Is my understanding about saving authentication info in cookies correct?If no, then what approach do they use to save authentication info in the browser?If yes, then how do they stop someone from copying the cookies or rather using the copied cookies?
