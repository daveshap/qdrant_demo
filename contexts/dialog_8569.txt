BEN: ... Luke, you must not go.
LUKE: But Han and Leia will surely die.
BEN: You don't know that. Even I cannot see their fate.
LUKE: I can help them!
BEN: You're not ready yet. You still have much to learn.
LUKE: I feel The Force.
BEN: But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
YODA: Yes, yes. To Obi-wan you listen young one. The tree. Remember your failure at the tree! Heh?
LUKE: I've learned so much since then. And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
BEN: Will you? You underestimate The Emperor. It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
LUKE: And that is why I must go.
BEN: Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
LUKE: You won't.
BEN: Only a fully trained Jedi Knight, with The Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
YODA: Stopped they must be. Do you hear? On this all depends.
BEN: You are the last Jedi, Luke. You are our only hope. Be patient.
LUKE: And sacrifice Han and Leia?
YODA: If it must be. Yes.
