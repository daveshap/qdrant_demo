If given an interview, should I mention that they would be my very first job?
I am looking for a first job, but I'm not sure if I should mention that in an interview. 

Also, does anyone have tips on scoring a first job? 

I'm a recent college graduate. I've applied for all sorts of jobs, but seldom hear back from anyone.
