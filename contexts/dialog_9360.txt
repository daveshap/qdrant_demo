MR. HAND: Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
SPICOLI: Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
MR. HAND: I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
SPICOLI: Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
MR. HAND: Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
SPICOLI: I don't know. I guess so.
MR. HAND: Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here. As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
