I QUIT on the idea of finding a romantic partner today. I ACCEPT being single forever
So I am 27F and I am done trying to find myself love in the form of a romantic partner. I have so much to give so much love, care, compassion to give but I get friend-zoned or bro zoned every time. Guys will tell me you are the most genuine and loving person I have ever met, they will vent to me for hours but nope I am not marriage worthy.  I have tried with all kinds of guys, I guess my standards are too high for them. I simply demand basic human things. Communication, ambition, respect, humor, intellect to name a few but I guess that's too much nowadays.

So today I QUIT officially here which is to announce that I will be focusing my energies on living my life and doing great things. May be finding a romantic partner isn't for me. I am not made for this.

Rant over.
