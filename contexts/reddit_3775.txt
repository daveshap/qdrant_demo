Did I do the right thing?
I was on a second date with a girl, and she said "I'm a fundamental feminist, I demand the same from my partner, I don't just expect it, I demand it"

I don't know why, but I danced away from the table (we were in a bar)

I did the move in which you bend at the knees at fist bump your chest, then I did an Irish jig to the door. Once outside I just thought "ohhh dear" and went home

I work with the girl's friend, so it was pretty awkward for a few days

EDIT. Thanks for replies/opinions everyone. Nothing really happened after that, other than having to work with her friend that I mentioned, but she was more passive aggressive than anything else

The girl I dated sent a few angry texts, but didn't show up at my work to cause a scene or anything like that

I don't even know why I danced away, I never dance, and I wasn't trying to be funny, or show off
