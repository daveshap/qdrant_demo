ADELE: No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
LUKE: Me too.
ADELE: You look... different.

LUKE: I did? Huh!

LUKE: Go on home, folks. And thanks for the welcome.
LUKE: I'll be home in a little while, Harry. Don't wait up.
HARRY: You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
LUKE: You bet.
HARRY: Goodnight, son. 'Night, Delly.
