I just want to stop existing
I’m terrified of death and not knowing what comes after it, but I don’t see life as something precious or valuable. All I see is suffering and endless hopelessness. I am losing interest in everything and I can feel myself slipping away. It’s been like this for so long I don’t know what happiness feels like and I spend my days drifting in a mixture of self loathing and numbness. I’m so tired and find sleep to be my only escape. School on top of my struggling really exhausts me mentally and physically. I’m scared to die, but falling asleep for a really long time just sounds so nice. Even then though, I’d have to wake up and face the cruel reality that there really isn’t anything to be happy about. And it hurts because I can’t escape it. No matter how many nights I spend trying to cry the pain away it’s still there. I have no motivation to really change my life either though, I physically can’t force myself no matter how much I want to, to do anything productive. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, does anybody know what to do? I’m overflowed with these feelings and I can’t help but feel the only way to get some release besides sleep is to harm myself, even if I know it’s not going to help in the end. I’m just done and I can’t keep up with school or my relationships anymore. I need some advice on what to do :(
