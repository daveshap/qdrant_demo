Update: I had my period while I was with the guy I was seeing during our first time together.
He handled it like a Pro and a lot of you gave me the peace of mind that it was a bigger deal in my head than it realistically was. We had another date, I asked him out to dinner for “being a sweetheart and handling things so well”. The night went really well, ended back at his place and had one of those nights that just makes me smile while reminiscing about it. It was so intimate and I’ve never felt so adored. I think I’m starting to really like this guy.

EDIT: Should have been more clear. My period came unexpectedly that night and ruined his sheets. Apparently it happens more often than I thought.
