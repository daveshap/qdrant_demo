RAE: Thank you.
R.L.: I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
RAE: You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
R.L.: So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is... You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
RAE: You a preacher?
R.L.: That's right.
RAE: Can I ask you a question? People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
R.L.: You could put it that way.
RAE: But that's so fuckin' stupid. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
R.L.: What's on your mind?
RAE: You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
R.L.: I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me. I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
