ED: You do know how to do that, don't you?
ERIN: Yeah. I got it. No problem.
ED: Good.
ED: You're a girl.
ERIN: Excuse me?
ED: How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
ERIN: I guess I'm not the right kind.
ERIN: Anna? With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
ANNA: Erin, you've been here three weeks. If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
