CAPTAIN O'REILLY: Whom have I been harboring in my house? Who are you, sirrah?
RODERICK: Sirrah! Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
CAPTAIN O'REILLY: You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
RODERICK: Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
CAPTAIN O'REILLY: Tut, tut! I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah! You change color, do you? Your secret is known, is it? You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit. I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find? A fraud.
