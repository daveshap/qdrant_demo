Grad School Fellowship Questions
Hello all,

I recently subscribed to this community. I started a month ago a little early for a masters program in geology. I strongly feel as though I will want to pursue a PhD but was waiting to see how much I like research full time before then. I think I will decide maybe October or November. 

I am debating applying for fellowships whose deadlines are late this fall. However I am not sure it is worthwhile- I likely will not have published or presented by then (though will have some preliminary results and data, I hope to definitely present this spring). And, I am very new in the program. 

However I did present a little in undergraduate, was extremely involved in extra-curricular activities (a trend I plan on continuing), received several scholarships, graduated with honors *et cetera*. I know my project, and am really starting to focus in on my career and personal goals. 

I guess my question is, is it worthwhile to take the time to really make a good application? And if I plan on getting a PhD, should I just wait till next year when I am more competitive since I'll still have a long time to go yet? I am already funded through an RA and full tuition waiver. 

Thanks all, hope to get some good feedback.
