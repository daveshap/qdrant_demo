Question about a recruiter
I was recently contacted on linked in by a recruiter. This recruiter won't even tell me about the job opportunity but wants me to send in my resume so the hiring manager can look at it. It all looks legit, but I can't imagine why they wouldn't even tell me what job they are hiring for. Is this common or is it the red flag I'm taking it for?
