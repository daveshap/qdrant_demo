Just notified of layoffs. Glad I had started saving for an Emergency Fund
After a couple years of being chronically underemployed (lived in a van for part of it) I got a new job with ok pay and quite a bit of available overtime. I've been taking advantage of the overtime and got caught up in all my bills. Then I saved up $1,000 for an emergency fund a l√† Dave Ramsey.

After that I've been putting anything extra into paying off credit cards (first one was 29%!). 

About a month ago I had a dream. It's a common stress dream, so normally, I wouldn't think too much of it. I'm not into astrology, or dream interpretations, horoscopes, etc. I don't look at dreams real closely for "interpretations" etc. But this one was just really unsettling to me, and I distinctly felt that I needed to stop paying down debt and start saving instead. 

So for the past month I've been socking away the OT money.

Today I found out my company's contract is getting bought out by another company. 

There's a pretty high chance I will be rolled over into the new company, but I can't tell you how nice it feels to know I have at least a full months expenses taken care of. Even if I take a position elsewhere in the company, I'd have to relocate, and it's nice to know I have enough to at least get me a deposit + first month rent in a new place.

I'm gonna be ok, one way or another.
