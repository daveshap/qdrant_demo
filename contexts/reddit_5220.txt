I broke an expensive equipment at work
So I was working on a checklist to see if all of our equipment works and I was putting a bagtery in a machine and I put it in backwards and it got stuck. I eventually used some pliers to try and get the battery out since it was a better grip for it. The casing for the battery broke and the battery is still stuck. 

I have told my senior and I am awaiting for his response tomorrow morning. Will I get in trouble for breaking the machine? I tried my best to fix it and stopped once I realize I was in trouble. Is honesty my best policy? Can I get written up for an accident?
