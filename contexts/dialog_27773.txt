ALEX: ... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
ERIN: So you're going to kill him?
ALEX: Have to find him first.
ALEX: You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
ERIN: My father.
ALEX: All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
ERIN: I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
ERIN: I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
ALEX: It's what Lauren would do.
