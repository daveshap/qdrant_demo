GRAHAM: Sidney: I don't understand him. We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience. To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming. The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me. Why the mirrors?
BLOOM: The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them. I don't have an answer for you. Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
GRAHAM: And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper? In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home? This ends when I make it over.
BLOOM: How are Molly and the boy?
GRAHAM: Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana. Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
