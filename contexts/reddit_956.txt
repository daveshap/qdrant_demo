Does anyone else stay up all night because they're nervous about the next day?
I don't mean like not being able to fall asleep because you're nervous but just every night purposely staying up so that the morning will arrive slower. Idk how to explain it but I stay up till like 7am every night because I don't want the next day to be here yet. I also stay up because I feel like I have so much to do before going to sleep but then I end up procrastinating it and not doing it and staying up for no reason. idk maybe someone can relate?
