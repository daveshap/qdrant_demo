rolling friction of a solid sphere This may be a very rudimentary question. I have two spheres on a physics simulator and I need to define various parameters including rolling friction, spinning friction, inertia, color etc.I was able to get find/tune most parameters except rolling and spinning friction.My belief is that both frictions depend on the size of the sphere. I have spheres with varying radii. One is 0.05m and the other is 0.1m(both have mass of 0.1kg). I set the rolling friction of both spheres to be 0.03 but what exactly is the relationship between the properties of a solid sphere and sphere's friction?EDIT:I have spheres that are (2.0kg, 0.1m), (2.0kg, 0.075m), (1.5kg, 0.1m), (1.5kg, 0.075m) in (mass, radius) format. Can I get some sample coefficients for these assuming they are on the same surface, made with the same material.
