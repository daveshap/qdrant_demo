MARK: Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
JUNO: I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
MARK: No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...
JUNO: Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
MARK: Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
JUNO: Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
MARK: I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs... ...They're not bad.
JUNO: Why aren't you at work?
MARK: I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
JUNO: No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
MARK: No, more commercial stuff.
JUNO: Like what?
MARK: Commercials.
JUNO: Oh.
MARK: Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
JUNO: Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
MARK: I wrote that.
JUNO: You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
MARK: They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
