I want to lose weight but im basically the token fat guy of the group
I’m at the point of my life where I’m getting way to overweight and it doesn’t help that I’m 5’5. I want to start to lose weight but I feel like my whole personality and how I interact with my friends and how they interact with me is that I’m the fat guy. For example. my friends and I made a video the other day and in one of the scenes I die by eating a doughnut, jaws style, then getting shot. the clip ends by the doughnut falling on the floor. I feel trapped because I feel like I’ll lose what I have if I lose weight.

I wouldn’t even know where to start if I even was to commit to losing weight.
