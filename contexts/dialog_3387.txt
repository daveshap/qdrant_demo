CRAIG: Hi.
MAXINE: You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
CRAIG: Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
MAXINE: Yikes.
CRAIG: Please, let me explain.
CRAIG: It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
MAXINE: You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
