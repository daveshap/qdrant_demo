PETER: You feel anything?
LEONARD: Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
PETER: Leonard, listen. I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back. Look, I'm trying to help you here...
LEONARD: Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy. You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
PETER: I'm sorry. But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
