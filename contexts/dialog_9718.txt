CATHERINE: Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
BOBBY: Then after that?
CATHERINE: After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
BOBBY: Tomorrow, then.
CATHERINE: Tomorrow's a full practice day... But the day after is kind of open.
CATHERINE: Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
BOBBY: The day after tomorrow.
CATHERINE: If you're free.
BOBBY: Yeah, I'll probably be free.
