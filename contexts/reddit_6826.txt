For anyone that has been laid off or fired. Are these some warning signs? Or am I being paranoid?

I work in billing and collections for a regional healthcare system in the Northeast. As a result of COVID19, we’ve been told by management that revenue is projected to drop by millions of dollars. 

My supervisor told the team yesterday that productivity is going to be tracked closely and now is the time to crank it up to avoid “outsourcing and layoffs.” Healthcare has been hit super hard in terms of layoffs across the country. 

Now with that being said, I like the organization because they like internal promoting. I’d like to get a position in HR as that is my career goal and am using my current position as a stepping stone.  However, they are not posted any vacancies in the organization’s HR department. 

However, I received an offer for the contact tracer job for the state of New York which pays $20,000 more than my current job. I don’t know what the benefits look like yet and may have that position until May 2021 or less, it depends on the spread of the virus. 

PS: I am not an expert in the line of work I do but I engage and actively seek opportunities to learn. However, I am the least experienced out of my 10 member team. 

With that being said, both options feel a bit risky. However, I went over through some work I did yesterday with my supervisor to improve my understanding of my new workflow. I’m being moved to a new position in the revenue cycle since we have a new hire. And the end of the zoom call..she asks if I sign a form saying that I have received additional education...I have a feeling layoffs/outsourcing or just being fired is coming for me and they’re gathering a paper trail. Am I being paranoid? How do I leave on a good note without ruining any opportunities of coming back in  the near future in an HR position?
