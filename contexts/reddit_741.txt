Please Help
So, I’m in a unique situation. I’ve been best friends with this one girl for 10+ years and I’ve had a crush on her for that period of time. Well, it’s to the extent where I’m willing to say I’m deeply in love with this girl. And she’s not just my friend she’s my best friend. Even considers herself to be my sister. Well recently we hung out and we play wrestled and cuddled and watched Netflix. And now I think she may like me or I’m very deep in the friendzone. Can someone please give me some advice on what I should do?
