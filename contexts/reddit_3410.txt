So... I apparently have a girlfriend now and we haven’t even met in person yet.
So a week ago I posted about meeting a woman whose 6 feet tall and I’m only 5’6”. Well we’ve been talking a lot since this whole coronavirus thing started. Well shortly after I made my post she asked me if I had already picked a pet name for her yet. I of course haven’t yet, but of course she did already. Apparently I’m her “Chicken Nugget” because I’m shorter than her. Ha Ha Ha Ha, I said. 

Well last night we got talking for our regular 4 hour video chat session and we started talking about BF/GF status and apparently I have a GF now. I know we haven’t met in person, but conversation flows super easy and I totally feel like I can show her the person I am, and it turns out she’s just as goofy and weird as I am. She has already broken down my facade and she likes it. All I have to say is that I’m pretty excited because she’s totally my type.
