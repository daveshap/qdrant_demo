WALSH: Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
GITTES: I don't want Mulvihill. I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
DUFFY: Then what'll you do?
GITTES: Sue the shit out of 'em.
WALSH: Yeah?
GITTES: Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing. We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
WALSH: Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
SOPHIE'S VOICE: Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
GITTES: Okay.
GITTES: Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
IDA'S VOICE: Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
GITTES: Isn't everybody? What can I do for you, Miss Sessions?
IDA'S VOICE: Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
GITTES: When did you come in?
IDA'S VOICE: I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
GITTES: Shut the fuck up! ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
IDA'S VOICE: Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
GITTES: I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
IDA'S VOICE: Oh no.
GITTES: ...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
IDA'S VOICE: No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
GITTES: The obituary column?
IDA'S VOICE: You'll find one of those people.
GITTES: 'Those people?' Miss Sessions.
