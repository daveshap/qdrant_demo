Can I make an image from the disk starting at x address? I'm trying to get a specific data from the disk starting at specific address (don't know if it was physical address or not, ex: 0x00000000DA88FFFF, with size 0x5776). Actually I'm new with disk imager and these stuff and I found that dd command is suitable for making disk images, but I couldn't found anything related to start imaging from specific addresses with a specific size, is there anyway to do this? I want to extract a specific information from the disk.
