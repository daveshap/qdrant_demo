How much will a generic first name hurt my chances of getting accepted to Harvard???
This might sound odd, but please hear me out.

My first name, Jacob, was ranked the most frequently-given baby name of 2001 (ssa.gov). Since I know that elite colleges look at applications "holistically" and want a diverse class, will having an extremely common first name like 'Michael' or 'Matthew' drastically lower my chances of being accepted? There was a person at my school two years ago (who I think was originally called James)... he switched his name right before application season to 'Tichawonka' and got into Stanford, Princeton, Harvard, Tsinghua, etc. Coincidence? I doubt it; he flunked nearly all his classes and had virtually no ECs.

My mother and the 11 out of 12 of my private college consultants believe that I should replicate this in compensation for donating only one building to Harvard this year. I really don't want this to happen (I prefer my current name to some of the alternatives my parents have suggested). To make matters worse, we've already hired a big-name lawyer who "can get it done within a week". I'm very skeptical... is it really a good idea to legally change your first name in order to boost your chances at these top institutions?
