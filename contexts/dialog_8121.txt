STENSLAND: Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud. You nailed him good.
BUD: Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory. Want to grab a beer?
STENSLAND: Rain check me, partner. I got something big going on tonight.
BUD: What? That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
STENSLAND: No. I'll tell you sometime. Not now. Don't want to jinx it. But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
BUD: What are you talking about?
STENSLAND: It's confidential, Bud. Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. <u>Hush-Hush</u>. I'll see you tomorrow. And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
