So I'm not really sure who may be reading this, but whoever you are, I just wanted to tell you that you matter and even though I have no idea who you are, you can always message me, and so many other people in the subreddit if you need to. It's really important to put you and your mental healh first, and make it your first priority. Take care of yourself because you are worth it. Your are not alone, and understand depression is an uphill battle. Your are so strong, and you can get through this. I love you. Take care. Stay safe. Get the help and support you deserve.
