Has anyone experienced a real, significant culture change at their job that wasn't based on massive firing?
It's heard all the time how places need a culture change so a new boss comes in, who usually doesn't know the business, changes stuff, makes a mess, then leaves, and the place is still in bad or worse shape. A lot of good people who have marketable skills leave because they don't need to tolerate it. The voids are filled by more bad people.

 Short of a place completely cleaning house and firing everyone and starting fresh, has anyone experienced a a success story? A positive, lasting good culture change? Something that made you want to stay?
