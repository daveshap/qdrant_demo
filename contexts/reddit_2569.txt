Is it in poor taste to quit a job I just started to accept a better offer?
I accepted a job last week, and tomorrow will be my first day. Another company I have been interviewing with contacted me today to complete a background check, and on their online portal it says "offered". I don't have an official offer, but I believe one is contingent on my background check. It is higher pay, better benefits, and more aligned with my career goals. 

I would just quit my first offer, but I am worried the background check won't go through. I am mostly concerned because my last job was an unpaid volunteer internship. HR at my previous internship won't be able to verify my "employment". Only me previous manager. Do you think this will make me fail the background check? HireRight didn't have me fill in any employment information, but I imagine they are getting that information from my resume or job application. 

So currently my plan is to go to my first day tomorrow, and continue working the first job until I potentially get an offer from the second place. I'm hoping it will be a week or less. Or, should I just call and tell them I decided to accept another offer? I feel bad wasting their time, but I'm worried I won't really get an offer from the better company. 

I really need advice.
