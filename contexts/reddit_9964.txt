What To Do After Undergrad an Before Grad School
I recently graduated from ungrad and just need some time before diving into grad school for Higher Ed.

 While I am looking at universities for grad, is there any way I could continue working at a university? Like a part time internship type deal or something similar? How and who would I contact at universities to express my interest in just helping out in anyway I can?
