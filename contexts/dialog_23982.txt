SIMONE: Hi.
VIKTOR: Perfect. God, I'm so relaxed around you.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: You did create me.
VIKTOR: No. I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you. I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
VIKTOR: You're right. You're right. Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist. That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
VIKTOR: See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake. -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real. Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway. Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
VIKTOR: The only real truth is in the work.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: You know what I'm talking about.
VIKTOR: Yes. Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...? Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him. I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
VIKTOR: Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
SIMONE / VIKTOR: Not, Eternity Forever"? The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made? I'd kill for that part."
VIKTOR: I was hoping you'd say that.
SIMONE: I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
VIKTOR: I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
SIMONE: I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
