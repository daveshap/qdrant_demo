LOGAN: Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
MAX: Yes on all counts.
LOGAN: I'm sorry. It wasn't my intention. But I had to see you.
MAX: You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
LOGAN: I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
MAX: You need to get out more.
LOGAN: C'mere, I want to show you something.
MAX: Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
LOGAN: No, I meant this.
