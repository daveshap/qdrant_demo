MURPHY: How's he doing?
EPPS: Same. Any luck?
MURPHY: No. I'll try again later.
EPPS: They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
MURPHY: Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
DODGE: On a passenger ship in 1953?
MURPHY: If they knew what they were carrying.
EPPS: You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
MURPHY: If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
EPPS: Only something must've gone wrong.
