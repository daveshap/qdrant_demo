'Zone Battle' mode is unclear One of the event types in the Wipeout HD / Wipeout Fury mode is Zone Battle.  The instructions are complicated and it's not really clear what's going on in-game; I seem to do either really well or come dead last.What's the goal of Zone Battle, what do these boosts, shields, and barrier mechanics do, and what's a general strategy to win?
