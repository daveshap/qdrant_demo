MAX: I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
JACKIE: Okay.
JACKIE: Are you really a bail bondsman?
MAX: Who do you think I am?
MAX: I gave you my card there.
JACKIE: Can I see your I.D.?
MAX: You're serious?
JACKIE: Who put up my bond? Ordell?
MAX: In cash.
JACKIE: Can we stop for cigarettes?
MAX: Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
JACKIE: I don't think so.
MAX: It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
JACKIE: Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
MAX: I thought you might want a drink?
JACKIE: I'd love one, but not there.
MAX: We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
JACKIE: Is it dark?
MAX: It's kind of a sports bar
JACKIE: That doesn't sound dark.
MAX: Why does it need to be dark?
JACKIE: 'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
MAX: Great.
