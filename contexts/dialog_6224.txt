ALEX: She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
MINISTER: Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
MINISTER: Not feeling too bad now are you?
ALEX: No, sir, I feel really great.
MINISTER: Good.
ALEX: Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
MINISTER: Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex.
