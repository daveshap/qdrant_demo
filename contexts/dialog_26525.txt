LOIS: Oh, I've got to get some matches. My cigarette.
SUPERMAN: I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
LOIS: Oh. Well, where do we start?
SUPERMAN: Ask, You're the girl reporter.
LOIS: Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
SUPERMAN: You think they're strange?
LOIS: I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
SUPERMAN: I guess they are a little odd.
LOIS: Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
SUPERMAN: I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
LOIS: Oh.
SUPERMAN: The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
LOIS: It must feel great.
SUPERMAN: It's not bad.
LOIS: How old are you?
SUPERMAN: Thirty-five.
LOIS: How much do you weigh?
SUPERMAN: 195 pounds.
LOIS: What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
SUPERMAN: What about it?
LOIS: Can you really see through anything?
SUPERMAN: Uh-huh.
LOIS: Is it true you're impervious to pain?
SUPERMAN: Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
LOIS: Do bullets really bounce off you?
SUPERMAN: Only when somebody shoots them at me.
LOIS: What color underwear am I wearing?
SUPERMAN: Pink.
LOIS: Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
SUPERMAN: Sure.
LOIS: Do you like pink?
SUPERMAN: Very much.
LOIS: Where do you hail from?
SUPERMAN: Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
LUTHOR: Krypton!
EVE: Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
LUTHOR: Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe. Y'know.
EVE: I read the article.
LUTHOR: Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
