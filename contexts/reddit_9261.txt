I finally cancelled recurring subscriptions that I haven't been using. I'm saving an extra $46 per month now!
I wanted to post this as a reminder to check your recurring subscriptions! There might be something you forgot about/ don't think about until the payment comes out of your account. The three I cancelled are
Amazon Prime: $15
HBO subscription: $16
 Chegg Study: $15
and there is one more that I'm on the fence about, but it would save another $11 each month.

I don't know why I kept these for so long. I rarely order from Amazon. Definitely not enough to justify the prime membership, and I signed up for that free trial of HBO and then forgot about it. I haven't used Chegg in a year.

I'm planning to put this $46 straight into my savings account each month. That will be an extra $550 by this time next year!

If you haven't already, look through your bank statements from last month and make sure you cancel anything you're not using!
