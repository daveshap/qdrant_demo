CARTER: What?
STECKLER: I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
CARTER: Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
STECKLER: Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
STECKLER: What's wrong?
CARTER: Nothing could be better...
