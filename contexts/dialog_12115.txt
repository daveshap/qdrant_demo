DONALD: Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
WICHITA: I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right? Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right? I have to see her...
DONALD: Say Hi for me.
