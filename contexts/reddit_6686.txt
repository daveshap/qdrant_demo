How do you write a good cover letter for an internship position?
Some background:

I’m an undergraduate student from Canada majoring in Economics and I’ve just competed my third year of a four year program. Although I’ve had several summer jobs in the past, I’ve never been able to get a position related to my field. I have a decent GPA (B+) and I’ve had my resume proof read by the career development office at my university. 

Over the past couple of months I’ve applied for 15+ positions for this upcoming summer and I haven’t been contacted for an interview. 
I try to personalize each cover letter, and specifically explain why I’m a good fit for the position skill wise. I know a big part of the reason I haven’t received any interviews is my lack of professional experience outside of the academic environment, but it seems you need experience to get experience.

I’m hoping some recruiters or experienced professionals can provide me with some insight on a good format for a cover letter and what kind of information to include when all you have is academic experience. Thanks in advance!
