What do YOU bring to the (dating) table?
It seems like the past 2-3 weeks there has been a significant amount of posts along the same lines - asking for help:

​

- men/women who are 28-70+

- no dating or sexual experience

- never had a girlfriend/boyfriend

​

We all have different upbringings, and I realize that many people struggle with family probs, mental health issues, lack of employment, financial hardships, weight issues, etc. But the common goal for most in this sub is to find LOVE! To have someone care about you, accept you, and to have sex with is a human desire that is not easy for some to find, it may elude others for years, and some it may never happen for. I see the same advice on 'repeat' in all of the posts by these people, although I respect that they reach out and want to change and find love, there HAS to be some accountability. SO IF you fit in this category, please take note:

​

Saying "I want to find a girlfriend/boyfriend" sounds fine and dandy, but what can YOU do for a girlfriend/boyfriend? I think a lot of people really believe that because they have a desire to have someone to love them, they see others their age with someone, or they just want to not be a virgin - that is enough. It isn't. Past the age of 25, most adults have goals: they work, they are supporting themselves, they are independent. And past the age of 30, some adults are looking to settle down and start families. BE HONEST and take stock in what you have to bring to the table. Can you be/do all of those thing? Can you hold down a job and support yourself OR if it happens, a family? Can you pay bills? Grocery shop? Cook and clean? The very basics of living alone. Are you a fun person, interesting, not a bore? Can you afford to date? Not all things cost money, but for the most part they do...think about that kind of stuff. Notice I didn't say you have to be rich, have a high paying job, or a luxury car?! That's because that is a misconception. Being independent does not equal being rich. Don't confuse the 2 and use that as an excuse.

​

To get people to be attracted TO you, you have to BE attractive to others. If you aren't coming to the table with anything...outside of "Im a nice guy/girl, I love to make people laugh, I care about others, blah blah blah..." then you cannot expect someone who does bring more, to want to come to YOUR table with you. That isn't fair to either of you. 

​

Take the time to learn the social norms and graces. Please! This is no dig at anyone per se, but rest assured that if you are over the age of 25 and men/women continue to reject you, don't pay you any mind, or tend to ghost you repeatedly - it is something you are doing. The older you get without practicing your communication and approach skills IRL (not just online), the more awkward your personality will be - I don't care what your friends and family tell you. They are there to love you, not tell you the harsh truth. You can workout, have a great job, and your own place - but if your personality isn't developed, you are extremely awkward, some of you may be creepy, and aren't able to pickup on social cues or body language, do yourself and others a favor and take some time to learn. Put your wish to date on hold a bit, Get a therapist, get a life coach, get a dating coach, volunteer (with other people not animals or alone - so you can practice communicating)...take steps to improve YOU. People tend to smell desperation the minute someone starts talking, and there is nothing more creepy then a grown person who says off the cuff or weird things (or acts that way) because they have no clue what they are doing or how to do it. So give yourself the advantage by learning how to effectively speak to the opposite sex. Learn how to socialize. If you have anxiety or are socially inept, that's ok. Be open to advice and WORK on it. Not everyone has love fall in their lap out the sky. Don't fallback on it as a reason not to try to change. You want to be loved - do the work. 

​

The point of this is to say: IF you need a step-by-step playbook on all things 'dating' (from A-Z), then the typical post of "I'm a 30yr old virgin, never dated, and I want to start now" will NOT get you the results you want in this sub or in reality. I promise you that. That's why the advice in all those posts are the same thing...over and over. PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE TIME NOR THE PATIENCE TO HOLD YOUR HAND AND WALK YOU THROUGH EACH STEP IN GETTING ATTENTION, I'm sorry. Professionals get paid to do that, so find one to help you! Do your own research, proactively take steps to help yourself first. Go out and practice. You will fail, yes, like a baby learning to walk, but keep trying. If your mental health has always been a struggle, don't ignore that as important..it is. If you give up you can't expect results...good or bad.
