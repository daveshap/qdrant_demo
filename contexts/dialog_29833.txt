COLE: We need gas.
RAILLY: I thought you didn't know how to drive.
COLE: I said I was too young to drive. I didn't say I was stupid.
RAILLY: What's the matter with your leg?
COLE: I got shot. Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
RAILLY: Shot! Who shot you?
COLE: It was some kind of...war. Never mind, you wouldn't believe me. Turn off here.
COLE: You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?
RAILLY: No. I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
COLE: That has your name on it. Give him cash.
