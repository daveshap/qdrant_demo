International Relations Graduates - what advice would you give to a student currently studying an IR degree?
I’m currently in my second year of University and I’m studying IR. Although I love the course and it’s contents, I’m having trouble on understanding the pathways I should consider in being successful in my future career. I’ve heard it’s essential to learn a language whilst studying or even doing an internship. I just want to somewhat solidify a career plan/s that will make me hopeful being where I want to be in the future. Any tips will be greatly appreciated!
