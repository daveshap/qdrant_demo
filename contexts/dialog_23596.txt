ANJANETTE: Don't you think there's too much gold?
GEORGE: It's great. You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
ANJANETTE: I don't know, I think...
GEORGE: Look, would you argue with your doctor?
ANJANETTE: No.
GEORGE: Hey, what's happening? Mary! Telephone. What's the matter?
RICCI: Wanda...
GEORGE: Oh yeah?
RICCI: You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
GEORGE: Yeah?...
RICCI: She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
GEORGE: I'm busy, man.
RICCI: If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
GEORGE: Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
ANJANETTE: I thought you were in a good mood.
GEORGE: I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
ANJANETTE: Don't you like her?
GEORGE: No, it's a very groovy girl.
ANJANETTE: Then what's the problem?
GEORGE: She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
ANJANETTE: What're you talking about, George?
GEORGE: Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
