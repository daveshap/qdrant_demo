McConnell says if Trump wins the nomination they will "drop him like a hot rock," running negative ads to separate Trump from the Congressmen up for re-election. Would Trump stand a chance in the general if the Republican establishment essentially campaigns against him?
[This NYTimes article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/us/politics/donald-trump-republican-party.html) outlines the Republican leadership's game plan if Trump wins the nomination (and their lack of a game plan up until this point). Although Trump looks to be gaining reluctant acceptance among some of his own party leadership, "the party's biggest benefactors remain totally opposed to him."  Campaign managers for Rubio and Kasich have stated they have plans "to wrest the Republican nomination from him in a deadlocked convention." 

But the most interesting thing to me is what McConnell plans if Trump wins the nomination outright: they will "run negative ads about Mr. Trump to create space between him and Republican senators seeking re-election."  They will essentially try to convince voters that Trump will lose and will "describe a Republican Senate to voters as a necessary check on a President Hillary Clinton." Would Trump stand any chance if the party leadership essentially campaigned against him?
