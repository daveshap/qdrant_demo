PEDROSA: Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
HELLER: Can you fax me his picture? His license or something? What do you mean you don't have that there? Anybody else in the cab?
VINCENT: Damn, Max. I'm impressed. Really. I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
MAX: Makes two of us.
VINCENT: Washington and Holt. Dance club called Fever." Know it?"
MAX: Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner. Twelve minutes.
VINCENT: You do impress me, Max. That you do.
HELLER: ...got off the phone with his dispatcher. What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
PEDROSA: So?
HELLER: ...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo. That guy? That guy is a cabbie. And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
PEDROSA: No. Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
