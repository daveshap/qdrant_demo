BUFFY: I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY: So I noticed.
JEFFREY: Nice to feel needed.
ANDY: Let's move out!
JEFFREY: Yes!
BUFFY: I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean? Lately it bugs me, I guess. Merrick? Are you still breathing?
MERRICK: I can't work this.
BUFFY: We call them zippers. They're not supposed to be a challenge.
MERRICK: But it's in the back. Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
BUFFY: Because you clash, Merrick. You clash with everything. I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.' Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
MERRICK: My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
BUFFY: Well, you're on my turf now. You're just gonna have to trust me.
MERRICK: I want to die.
BUFFY: Okay. The important thing is not to panic.
