Can the Logrus move under someone trying to walk it? All the descriptions that I remember of the Logrus describe it as \"constantly moving\" or similar, does this mean that someone walking it has to move fast before the area they're standing on moves out from under them and, given what happens if you step off the Pattern having started, they get destroyed?
