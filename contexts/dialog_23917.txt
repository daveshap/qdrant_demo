KATE: Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
J.T.: The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
KATE: Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
EMMETT: Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
JAKE: It was my fault.
KATE: It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
J.T.: His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
KATE: I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
