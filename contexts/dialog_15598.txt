KRIS: Phileas Fogg?
MAURICE: ... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
KRIS: You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
MAURICE: I told you.
KRIS: You're walking to California?
MAURICE: Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
KRIS: Oh, a coastal city. That's good.
MAURICE: Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
KRIS: She knew you loved her.
MAURICE: She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
KRIS: I'm really lost. What does this have to do with walking?
MAURICE: I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
MAURICE: I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
KRIS: Why know?
MAURICE: Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
KRIS: Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
MAURICE: So I've been informed.
