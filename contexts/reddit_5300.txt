Can I be fired for missing work due to heart problems?
I have been missing quite a bit of work lately due to having chest pain/ severe tightness along with several other symptoms. I am under the care of my doctor and cardiologist, I do keep trying to make it to work, but despite being on weight restrictions right now, they keep making me do things that go against my doctors orders, causing more pain and more issues. I have doctors notes each time I miss or even have to leave early/show up late (I've spent close to $200 8n just co-pays over the last few weeks), but they still write me up for it. I'm terrified I'm going to lose my job, but I need to figure out my health situation.. My supervisor texted me telling me after I was finished with current documentation that needs done, she was going to discuss my position with the company with me, so I feel like either she is going to put me on suspension, or just terminate my employment entirely.
Can she actually fire me for this?
