What to do about a job causing depressed mood?
My job is really starting to impact me mentally. Not my usual happy self. However, I am so close to bonus time and while not guaranteed one I did get one last year so fingers crossed. So I am unsure of whether to look or stay? I do have a major life event next year and don't want to make too many changes. In addition I feel the devil I know is better than an unknown. What should I do?
