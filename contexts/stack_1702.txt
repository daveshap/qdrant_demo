Understanding the MPX2053 Pressure sensor So I am a bit confused as to how I would operate a pressure sensor whose pressure range is between 0-50 kPa because the moment I remove it from the packaging and expose it to the environment, it will experience 101 kPa (1 atm) which is outside its pressure range. At the same time I feel that the sensor would be useless if I cannot take it out of the package, so how does it not experience the 1 atm pressure entered by the atmosphere?
