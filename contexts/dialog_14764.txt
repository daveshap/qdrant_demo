CITRINE: I'm shutting you down on this blind thing
BERLIN: Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
CITRINE: Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?

CITRINE: I'm talking, outside the girl?
BERLIN: Once.
CITRINE: Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
