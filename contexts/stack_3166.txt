Looking for name of a graphic novel I read a graphic novel once, and I have lost track of it. Google has been unhelpful.Here's some details I remember:It was published in a single volume, in full color, in that intermediate-length size between door stoppers like V for Vendetta and staple-bound Donald Duck. (Quite certain)It was published sometime in the latter half of the twentieth century. (Uncertain)It had a realistic art style. (Quite certain)It was tonally similar to e.g. the Nikopol trilogy. (Debatable)The main plot concerned a \u201cfake\u201d city with Dorsera (Sundew) plants as its motif. (Quite certain)The city was made up of cardboard facades akin to theatre flats, which could move on rails. (Quite certain) The main character was a cartographer. (Uncertain) He went from his home city across a desert, to the \u201cfake\u201d city. (Quite certain)He crossed the desert in a triple-decker airplane. (Uncertain)In the end he realized his folly, and stumbled back out into the desert towards his home town. (Quite certain)
