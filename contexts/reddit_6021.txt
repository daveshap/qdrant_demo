Corporate office making all employees return soon, despite going against state guidelines
I work for a company in the Philly metro, which is practically Pennsylvania's hotspot for the Coronavirus. Our current guidelines state that offices can reopen, but telework must resume where feasible. My company has been remote since March and telework has been 100% feasible. All directors and managers agree that telework has been a success considering that projects have been completed properly and on time. Our performance metrics are very stable, despite everyone working from home.

However, the director of our corporate office very much hates working from home, and it seems that him and leadership have made the decision to make us return to work without getting any input from employees. We are returning very soon.

My corporate office is a very old building with tight hallways, poor ventilation, cramped cubicle spaces and tiny meeting rooms. It will be impossible to social distance. IMPOSSIBLE. If there's any office that's a recipe to spread the virus indoors, it's 100% mines. I have no idea how they can enforce social distancing.

I have asthma and parents that are at high risk. My parents could easily get killed by the virus, and I'm afraid of being around co-workers in our crappy, poorly ventilated office building.

All of this is happening on top of my company forcing every employee to take 12 days of PTO this summer (and they DID NOT state a reason why). This is a for profit healthcare company.

Is anyone else in a similar position with their company as well? I am very upset that I have to deal with these issues.
