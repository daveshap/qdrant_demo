I think I'm having a burnout breakdown and I don't know what to do. Should I quit my job?
I'm  the introspective and analytic guy so, sometimes, I like to do my job  alone, without the interference of others, and sometimes, when I  interact with people, at the end of the day I feel exhausted.

I  work in a digital agency for a little more than three years. In the last year, before became de leader of my team, I've been the employee  who worked a shift of 12 hours long, but I loved of what I was doing,  taking care of 12 clients and my job was mostly hands on, without so  many meetings. Recently I became the coordinator of my team, so I have  to take care of 7 people, plus over 50 clients. And since the beginning  of the year all I'm doing now is doing meetings with current and new  clients, leaving my team aside. I feel responsible for a lot of mistakes  they've been doing, since I can't take a closer look at them because of  all these meetings. Sometimes these meetings start at 9 a.m. and end 9  p.m., one after another, lunch in front of the PC was really common (or  not eating at all). Besides that, I've been disliking the way the  company is being managed, since a new COO is in charge.

My  worst breakdown came when I was talking with my new employee, showing  to him a few things about the company, and seeing the messages in my  whastapp, skype and e-mail coming up all at once, feeling really  overwhelmed. When I finished speaking with this new employee, I called  to a fried of mine and started to cry a lot.

Besides  all that the corona virus situation makes me feel bad too. I've been  fearful that I contract this and let my parents sick too (both 70+). So  I'm really concerned with them, while them don't believe in anything of  what's happening.

For the past 30 days I'm having a breakdown, so working is being really difficult. For these past days I'm feeling:

* restless
* heavy chest
* couldn't sleep (or sleeping really late so I could enjoy more time away from work)
* I woke a lot of times feeling down and wanting to cry
* crying really, really easily
* questioning about my work and myself
* isolating myself
* easily forgetting any information
* walking up and down in my house with a blank mind, feeling anxious

I  asked for a vacation so I could rest a little, hoping that I could feel  better. I even disabled any notifications from my whatsapp so I could rest and don't think about them. But I'm in the last day of my vacation and canâ€™t see an end to feeling this way. I've been thinking about changing careers too, so I don't have to speak with clients.

I  tried to speak with the CEO and the COO about that, but all they did  was opening an excel table, write down a few solutions (none of them was good) and asking for me for a solution. There was no empathy to my feelings.

I don't know what this feeling is (burnout maybe?) and I don't know what to do. Should I quit my job and rest for a while? Should I change my career to another one that I don't need to talk with clients? Is there any other way to handle this?

Recently I started getting a psychological support, but still this feeling doesn't go away.

Ps: Sorry for my English, it's not my first language.

TL;DR:  I'm really introspective and I think because of my job as a team coordinator, having to talk to a lot of clients, going through a lot of  stressful situations (like averting cancellations), it's making me feel really down about my work and myself lately, and I don't know what to do or how make this feeling go away.
