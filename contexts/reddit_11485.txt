Seeing my ex boyfriend at work
My boyfriend and I broke up a couple months ago, and we work together (I got this job while we were dating, but honestly, I wanted this job because it's a ~really good job with good pay)
I still miss him sometimes, but I won't lie, it's mostly a sexual desire. He comes into work wearing a speedo to swim laps and it's beyond frustrating. It doesn't help that I'm gay and live in a conservative area, so there aren't any potential guys to distract me. 
Anytime he comes into work, my mind goes crazy trying to find a way to convince him to do anything sexual with me, even making out. I'm just extremely frustrated.
