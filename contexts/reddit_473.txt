Fell in love with a loner
Hey guys, i recently got to know an extremely pretty girl, and i think i realy like her more than just as a friend. The problem is, that she's kind of a loner, she obly has one or two firends and i'm probably the first guy she ever held a real conversation to, she has never had a boyfirend or anything simmular to that. I'm quite popular (not trying to flex or anything or sound intitlet) anyways she's alway kimda nervous wehen talking to me and a bit akward so on and so on... Should i make a move? Any adwice what i should do?
 
We're having a fieldtrip next week, should i try to make a move there?

English isn't my first language so sry for bad writing.
