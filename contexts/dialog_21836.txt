DADDY: I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
MOTHER: You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
DADDY: He's a polecat, dear.
DADDY: Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed. I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
MOTHER: I don't see how you can even think of it now.
ROSE: Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
BUDDY: Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
ROSE: You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
BUDDY: He did?
ROSE: Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, You know
BUDDY: Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
ROSE: He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
BUDDY: Yeah, I'd believe it.
ROSE: Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
BUDDY: Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
ROSE: I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
MOTHER: Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
DR. MARTINSON: Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
MOTHER: Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
