RITA: It's Johnny Cammareri.
LORETTA: Johnny.
MR. JOHNNY: Loretta...
RONNY: Johnny...
MR. JOHNNY: Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
RONNY: Good.
MR. JOHNNY: Have you come to make peace with me?
RONNY: Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
MR. JOHNNY: Of course I want to.
LORETTA: I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
MR. JOHNNY: We should talk alone.
LORETTA: I can't. I need my family around me now.
MR. JOHNNY: Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
RONNY: I'm sure she did.
MR. JOHNNY: It was a miracle!
LORETTA: Johnny, I have something to tell you.
MR. JOHNNY: I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
LORETTA: I have no secrets from my family.
MR. JOHNNY: Loretta, I can't marry you.
LORETTA: WHAT?
MR. JOHNNY: If I marry you my mother will die.
LORETTA: What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
RONNY: Loretta, what are you talking about?
LORETTA: I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
MR. JOHNNY: Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
RONNY: You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
MR. JOHNNY: And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
LORETTA: And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
MR. JOHNNY: I must ask for that back.
