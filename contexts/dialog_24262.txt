FRANK: Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
DOYLE: Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
DOYLE: What's in your bag?
KARL: This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
DOYLE: What's all them books?
KARL: Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
DOYLE: You believe in the Bible?
KARL: A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
DOYLE: Well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are you?
FRANK: Stop it, Doyle!
DOYLE: You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
KARL: I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.
DOYLE: You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then. It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
FRANK: Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
DOYLE: Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
