Anyone else get a case of the fuck-it’s, and just decide to have fun with it?
Just curious because I find that I have way more fun with the entire process when I treat it closer to a hobby rather than a job. 

Messages are crafted because I enjoy crafting them(obviously making sure they are not offensive), without any expectation of a response. Just crafting the message in an of itself is fun, especially when they have nearly empty profiles. 

A woman’s profile just said “sweet, loyal, and caring” and my message was “But can you tell me the flight speed of an unladen swallow”. Do I expect a response? NOPE, but I sure as hell had fun writing it. 

Go out, have fun! The best part is that it serves as a litmus test for people who will appreciate your type of humor.
