Identify weird Sci Fi movie from 70s/80s Things I remember (vaguely, maybe incorrectly) about this movie:the setting is overcrowded and we never see \"outside\so it may be in space or just a dystopian futureit's weird, like Brazil-level weirdit was intended for kids, so not as dark as Brazilthe living space is a maze, with walls and ceiling made of pipes and tubes of all sizesmay have robots or aliensI remember the old cathode ray TVs in useI seem to recall the title somehow didn't fit the settings (very strange clue)I watched it in a theater in America, so I'm sure it was a movie. I even vaguely recall the poster showed someone (a kid?) in the midst of this maze of pipes/tubes.Any ideas?
