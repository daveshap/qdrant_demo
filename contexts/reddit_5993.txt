"Don't Tell Them You Are in School"
After many years with only two years of college under my belt, I decided to return to University to finish obtaining a bachelor's degree. 

I am pretty miserable at my present job and have a potential opportunity to move to a job that offers benefits that I do not have, but it comes with a pay cut. As much as I don't care for the idea of going backwards, I thought I could still make it work, as I would have the opportunity for quick advancement. 

An acquaintance of mine scheduled my interview for next week, saying he'd rather do it on his day off instead of Monday. I commented in passing that worked for me, as I have Summer classes starting on Monday. He seemed surprised that I was in school and told me that I shouldn't mention that in any of my interviews, as his company wanted people that they felt would be devoted to the job. I told him it was a little late for that, as I had mentioned it on my application. 

Frankly, I feel disheartened. And although I will still go to the interview, it gives me pause as to whether I want to bother working for the company (should I be offered a position), as I am not willing to give up on my education now. Most of my classes are online, as I work 40+ hours a week now with crazy hours; but there will come a time when I may need to take a few classes on campus. My present job is at least supportive of my endeavor, even if I am not happy.

I thought a pursuit of education would be considered an admirable quality, if anything. It's been over a decade since I have been on a job hunt. Is this par for the course?
