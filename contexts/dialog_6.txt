CAMERON: Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
MICHAEL: Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
CAMERON: He always have that shit-eating grin?
MICHAEL: Joey Dorsey? Perma-shit-grin. I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class. And a model. Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
MICHAEL: You know French?
CAMERON: Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
MICHAEL: Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
CAMERON: You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
MICHAEL: You could consecrate with her, my friend.
JOEY: The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
KAT: Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break.
JOEY: They're running the rest of me next month.
KAT: The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
MANDELLA: You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends.
