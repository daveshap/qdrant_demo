Does \"ex-urban\" exist or have I made it up? I'm looking for a word that implies that people are moving out of cities: is ex-urban a word? I found it in the Urban Dictionary but that definition is not at all what I mean. I can't find it anywhere else. Below is what I would like to use as part of the title for my dissertation but I can't figure out how to say what I mean in a way that's grammatically correct:<blockquote>  U.S. [EX-URBAN?] MIGRATION OF LGBTQ+ POPULATIONS AND THEIR NEED FOR CULTURALLY-COMPETENT SUBURBAN HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS</blockquote>
