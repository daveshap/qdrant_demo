I’m scared of becoming an adult [F 14 years]
I don’t want to grow up i feel like I’m not going to accomplish anything i feel like I won’t have a great future and specially i feel like im not doing my best. I already plan on what i want when i grow up,nurse, but im still scared of growing up. I have so many goals that i really want to achieve but i feel like i wont achieve it because i dont trust myself and i feel like i depend so much. I already start saving money for my future but still worry that im not going to be successful in the future. Please help me on how i could be successful in the future i just dont want to fail.
P.S. sorry for my wrong grammar
