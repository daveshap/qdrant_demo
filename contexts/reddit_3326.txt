What are low stress jobs in STEM?
I recently graduated with an MS in food science and technology but I have an autoimmune disease (Graves’ disease) that I worry will make me unable to handle my fast-paced job in the future. 

I have some cognitive issues but I’m still able to work, just not as fast-paced and I cant handle stress like I used to. I have conceded that this might be my future. I’m tired a lot and would like a job where I can just go home and leave work at work. 

I have had two internships in the food industry (baked goods and candy) and experience in the lab and pilot plant, presenting, teaching, and mentoring. I also have statistical analysis experience in R though it’s not my strong suit. I mainly used Minitab, JMP, or Excel. I am familiar with principles of analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, food engineering, microbiology, dairy processing, and fermentation. 

Hopefully there’s a future for me since I worked really hard to get where I am just for my autoimmune disease to pop up and not respond to treatment.
