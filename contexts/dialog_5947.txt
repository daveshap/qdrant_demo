HOMER: It's just my heart.
ROSE ROSE: What you got a picture of your heart for?
HOMER: There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
ROSE ROSE: So what?
HOMER: Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
MR. ROSE: It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
HOMER: Right.
MR. ROSE: They told me I was too old to serve.
PEACHES: They told Muddy his feet was too flat!
