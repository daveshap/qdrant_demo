ELLIOT: This is not an easy situation.
LEE: I know it isn't.
LEE: That was just perfect. You've ruined me for anyone else.
ELLIOT: I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
LEE: I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
ELLIOT: Oh, my God.
ELLIOT: You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
LEE: Oh, all the time.
LEE: I know she must be a really passionate person.
ELLIOT: Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you. I-I-I want to do things for you. Hannah doesn't need me as much. I'm being presumptuous. Not that you need me.
LEE: I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
