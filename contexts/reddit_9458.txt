How do normal people afford nice things, seriously?
Backstory - I just started a new job making $45,000 a year which is huge for me since I was making $11.50/hr!!! (Single mom with two kids and live in a state with low cost of living) I am budgeting my finances for when I get my first paycheck and after the bills are paid, I’m literally going to have the same amount leftover each month as my old job. WTF. I guess the difference is I can finally afford to live in a rent house but I will be paying about $350/mo for daycare, and paying for healthcare now. I just can’t figure out how people buy expensive clothes or afford car payments, vacations, etc...

It makes me kind of rethink this opportunity....I was working from home and while the pay sucked ass, I was off in time to pick up my son from school and had a lot of time to run errands and take them to the park and stuff. Idk, I’m just kind of discouraged right now.
