I am moving from PA to FL .. suggestions on jobs that will hire me via phone /FaceTime/video chat ?
I pretty much have everything I need . A place to stay , my best friend ness a room mate in Daytona beach . I’m looking for a fresh start . I don’t need ro contribute a whole lot to living expenses yet so I’m pretty open to the type of job and pay . I will only be able to visit once or twice before I move so I need to apply with a company who understands that it would be the easiest for me to hired via phone or video chat . 

I am looking specifically in the Daytona beach , Florida area . Any tips on where to apply ?
