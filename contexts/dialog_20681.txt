CHARLIE: . Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
PEGGY: Charlie? Was I dead?
CHARLIE: I thought you were...for a while.
PEGGY: You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
CHARLIE: But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
PEGGY: Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
CHARLIE: I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
PEGGY: What about Janet?
CHARLIE: That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
