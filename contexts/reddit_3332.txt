How to be an attractive guy.
All of this advice on "how to read women" and "what to do/say" is bs. Social "intelligence" and body language are two very idiotic concepts because those rarely come innate and are very hard to control. This is why us guys stress "say what you want" because social "cues" are purposely misleading and cause misunderstandings more than not. And yet most women *still* rely on them more than verbal cues. 

It took me 10 years to "learn" social norms and cues, and how to portray confidence. I've read every "pick up" and "how to date/be attractive to women" book and article there is. From ones written by Red Pill misogynists to ones written by hardcore feminists/misandrists. I've spent hours and hours reading and practicing. I've bought lesson after lesson.

**It's all a waste of time.** 

If you're putting that much effort into being attractive, *no one* will find you attractive. 

The best thing I learned after all this time is to sit down and really figure out if I like myself. If you do this and you don't like yourself, figure out what you don't like and change it. *Self-Love is the most important love you can have.* Self-love comes before *everyone else* besides your children. You cannot love someone else, til you love yourself. 

Once you love who you are, spend every day focused on what *you* want. Ignore every woman unless she's a part of your life. Think of it like this: as a straight man, when other random men pass by, how do you view them? You don't. You don't care. They could be invisible. 

Yet when a random cute girl passes by she immediately occupies all the space in your brain. 

And she's literally done nothing but have a good bone structure and probably some meat on her body. Big whoop.

As a man you are *going* to learn this someday in life: The most gorgeous super model in the world still takes shits everyday just like you. Stop putting them on a pedestal and hiding your emotions. If you're on a date and there's a silence and she seems bored, ask yourself are you bored? Is she entertaining you? Is she making you laugh? No? Then why are you so concerned about entertaining her? No matter what our media portrays, it is not your job to entertain women. 

Focus on yourself and making sure you're having a good time. Focus on your life and make sure *you're* having fun. I'm not saying be a complete asshole. You should always care about people, but **not** more than you care about yourself. I've gotten so much attention from women by focusing on myself versus when I used to try and focus on them. 

So that's my advice.
