I broke 2k today!!
Over the last 4 paydays (or two months) ive been trying to keep $200 more in my checking account than the previous pay period. Today I broke 2k! I don't even remember the last time I had that amount without a personal loan or payday loan to justify it (to be clear I dont use either anymore.) Official number is 2,111.53. Sadly I do have bills to pay so iy be until next pay period that the money is actually mine. I dunno why I wrote this but I was excited when I checked my account this morning.
