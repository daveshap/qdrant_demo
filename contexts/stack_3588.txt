Now there are the users which have their own private certificates to send signed mails and encrypt decrypted mails for themself, but all users also access a central mailbox where they should be able to do the same but for this central mailbox.<br>So there is a private key for this central Mailbox<br>But how do i distribute the private key to all users, so they can read and sign mails as the central mailbox? Is there a way to install the private key automatically instead of importing the private key manually?
