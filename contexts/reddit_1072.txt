When I'm anxious, I procrastinate. After I procrastinate, I ruminate. Since I'm ruminating, I'm anxious to even get anything done, that I should have long started, thinking, "What's the point of doing it now, remember the first time you tried and failed by procrastinating ..."
And I wonder why I am losing control over my life.

update: A silver and these comments down below - whoa! I was sleeping on this post, much like how that initial novelty wears off from anything on Reddit. But I did sign-up for gym in the meanwhile, after 8 odd years of reluctance. As u/Basith_Shinrah pointed out in a comment down below,“*You put it in words. I feel that's the first step in overcoming it*”.
