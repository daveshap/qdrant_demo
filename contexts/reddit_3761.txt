Hey you single, beautiful, soul!
Valentines Day is around the corner and I know it can feel shitty, but just remember that romantic love isn't the only type of love there is.

Love comes in many forms, so who cares if you aren't in a relationship? Love for friends, family, chosen family, pets, SELF-LOVE. All equally important (sometimes even more important), and all equally valid.

So go on, celebrate love on Valentines Day, in whatever form you have it in. Spend time with loved ones or just treat yourself. You deserve it.
