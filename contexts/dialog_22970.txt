SHORTY: Aww, the little bird died.
CINDY: Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
SHORTY: Hey, I got an idea.
CINDY: That was a great idea, Shorty.
SHORTY: I told you it would taste just like chicken.
CINDY: Did you do that?
SHORTY: Uh, uh.
CINDY: You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
PROFESSOR: Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
CINDY: Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
DWIGHT: What the hell are you doing?
CINDY: Just wait, you'll see.
CINDY: Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
PROFESSOR: It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
CINDY: Got my camera right here.
CINDY: I got it!
PROFESSOR: That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
