OGG: Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature. We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle. Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
GUMP: We be honored, friend Ogg.
OGG: There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
JACK: You're with us in battle.
THURGIS: May God protect you.
