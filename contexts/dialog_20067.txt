ZACK: You told us it would grow out an inch.
SID: It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
PAULA: That was you guys, huh?
LYNETTE: Come on. Let's go dance.
LYNETTE: Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
SID: Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
ZACK: Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
PAULA: Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
ZACK: Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
PAULA: Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
ZACK: Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
PAULA: Seriously.
ZACK: My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
PAULA: Really?
ZACK: Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
PAULA: Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
