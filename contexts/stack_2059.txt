What is it called when someone who is not the author is mentioned on the paper as one of the authors? What is it called when someone who is not the author is mentioned on the paper as one of the authors? Some postgraduate students have to put the name of their professors on their papers as one of the authors, with no substantial work being done by the mofo professors. That is so corrupt! Some other researchers corruptly exchange authorship. That is, A in his paper corruptly mentions B's name next to his own name, providing that B does the same. Is there any word/phrase for such a research corrupt? I came across \"fake authorship\" or \"fake co-authorship\" on the Internet. Is that the right name for it? Or there is a spacial word/phrase for it?
