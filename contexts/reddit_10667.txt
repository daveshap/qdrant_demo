Am I the only one who finds thinking of suicide comforting?
The fact that I can always kill myself is really comforting to me, it gives me a feeling of control of my life, that in the end I can decide my fate, and no one can do anything about it. 
It's weird, some days this is the only thing that keeps me going.
