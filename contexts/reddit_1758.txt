Hey you, yes you. Congratulations!
After careful consideration of your value and worth as a person, I am pleased to offer you unconditional acceptance into a place of love and caring!

Your status as a valued person has earned you the right to love yourself regardless of how you do during the college admission season. You have an exciting future ahead of you and will be given opportunities to make friends, prove yourself, and be happy no matter where you end up. And if you're feeling down, just remember, admissions ain't shit. You--and only you--can decide what kind of person you become.


I look forward to seeing ALL of you do great things.
