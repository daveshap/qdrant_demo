CIVILIAN: You didn't like him.
WILLARD: Anyone got a cigarette.
WILLARD: I thought he was a lame.
COLONEL: A lame ?
WILLARD: This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
COLONEL: About what ?
WILLARD: I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
COLONEL: But why ?
WILLARD: He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
COLONEL: Well, he's killing now.
WILLARD: Maybe.
CIVILIAN: What does that mean ?
WILLARD: Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't believe he's capable of that. I just don't believe it.
