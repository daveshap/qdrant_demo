Starting to look for a post-PhD job. How?
Hello! In the past few weeks, I've been reaching the realization that I am in my last two years and I should give serious thought and begin planning for what's next.

I'm a 4th year PhD student in the US (I am a Canadian international student but would like to stay in the US after my PhD) and my research is on the reproductive endocrinology of fish -- the fish itself is commercially important, but my work is more on the basic science side. I took the opportunity to learn as many transferable wet lab skills as I have been able to so far.

I am not particularly interested in academia, so I have been thinking about industry. Recently, I thought about the prospect of going into government, which - in light of a recent Reddit post - might be more suitable for me as opposed to industry (at least for now -- I feel as if I'm not competitive enough). I suppose the general question is: how? Or rather, where do I begin and what steps do I need to take to prepare for this transition from school into looking for/going into a career in industry/government? I understand this is incredibly vague, but the idea of "what's next" has been so nebulous given the length of the program that I haven't really given much thought to it until now. I am not opposed to post-doc positions, but not cementing myself into an academic career long-term.

I'd appreciate any feedback and guidance you might have to offer.
