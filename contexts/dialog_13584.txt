INDY: Why are you trying to kill us?
KAZIM: Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
INDY: My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
KAZIM: No.
INDY: Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
KAZIM: If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
INDY: Then we'll die.
KAZIM: My soul is prepared. How's yours?
INDY: This is your last chance.
KAZIM: No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
INDY: All right! Where's my father
KAZIM: If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
INDY: Who are you?
KAZIM: My name is Kazim.
INDY: And why were you trying to kill me?
KAZIM: The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
