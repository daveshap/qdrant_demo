First office arrangement/decoration tips, if you've got 'em!
I've just got my first full time position, and I'll have my first office all to myself.  I'm excited, but also understand that a badly arranged office could make for some bad mojo when meeting and working in it.  I've gotten different tips from people.  Mainly people have pointed out that it is important in terms of ecology and creating an environment conducive to our objective, and that it should suit me as I'll be in it for a long time.

I've looked around my current job, and everyone is decked out.  Some have them full of football things, some "nerd" things, and then some look like a dorm room designed from etsy.  I love the personality.  But I'm concerned.  As a person with a learning disability, and someone who is detail oriented by nature, I have a very hard time in spaces where there are a lot of things.  I prefer bare walls with minimal decoration - I prefer informational material, or degrees displayed.  This is how I work best and how I believe I'll deliver services to students best, but I'm worried my new boss and coworkers will see it as boring or unimaginative.  

I'm probably over thinking this, but I'd love some help.  :)
