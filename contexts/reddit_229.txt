I like one of my best friends in my trio and am afraid of saying so [M17, M18, F17]
So I've been best friends with the same to people for the last 2 years, mostly due to us swimming together for HS and being some of the few HS kids who take classes at our local college instead of at hs, which got lonely, hence our incentive to bond. One is a guy friend thats actually been basically my bff for 6 years, we're both current seniors, the other is a girl we met at the beginning of hs through a stem program and swim. For my FR year and some of SO year i had a crush on her friend and tried to have her set me up without much luck, towards the end of SO year i had a relationship that turned sour but she took my side over my ex's even with them being close friends. Pretty much ever since then ive thought of her as almost a sister because she supports me so much but i also found that she is one of my favorite people to be around and developed a crush on her. For too long to remember in this friendship ive denied any feelings knowing that i should see her as only my friend. Even if i thought otherwise i dont know how it would affect us as a group, they are my rock keeping me from depression most days and if i tried to date her it could ruin everything. She may so no and i rely on my best friend for the time being, or she may say she shares feelings and my best friend resents me for ruining the trio, which would fuck up even more things since our parents are planning a triple graduation party for us. And even if that doesnt happen, what if my best friend also had feelings for her. But even if it all works out, i know she has plans after graduating, and they don't involve staying in state near us for college. Im at a loss for ideas and another day idk what to do is one where i wish i knew how they feel about me.
