Copy Polygon from one feature class to another, but auto create relationship records FYI, I have a very limited GIS background, but I can author code.I have a Stands (polygon) layer and I want a user to be able to copy stand(s) from this layer and paste it to another polygon layer (say a HarvestActivity). When the paste occurs I want to record the following in a related table of the HarvestActivity feature class that the polys were pasted into. StandId - Id of stand from source \"stand\" layerAreaOfStand - this is the area of the polygon of the HarvestActivity layer that covers a stand from the stands layer.AreaPercent - the percentage ratio to the original standAnother important note is that if someone edits the polygons in the activity layer, i.e. cuts or extend it. then the related table needs to be updated (changing the ratios, adding records, deleting records) automatically.E.g. If I extend a polygon in the HarvestActivity Layer and that polygon overlaps with 3 stands in the stands layer then we would need to have 3 records created.What is the best way to handle this in the GIS world? We will be using Portal and ArcGis Online, thus support of offline sync needs to be also considered.
