I have to take my APs at 2 am, 4am, and 12am. Seriously collegeboard???
I'm a AP student in hong kong. If you don't know, CollegeBoard introduced new policies where everyone around the world has to take APs at the same time, regardless of timezones. 

Well, lucky for me, the times they set just happen to be 0:00 am (12am?), 2am, and 4am. I understand that they can't find a time for everybody, but honestly how do they expect us to take AP tests at such an ghastly hour?
