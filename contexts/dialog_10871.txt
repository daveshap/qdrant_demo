DANA: We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
VENKMAN: Okay, I'll help you. Should we make some dip or something?
DANA: He is the Destructor.
VENKMAN: Really? Can't wait to meet him. As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
DANA: Do you want this body?
VENKMAN: Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
DANA: Take me now.
