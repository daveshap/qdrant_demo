BOND: So you killed your father.
ELEKTRA: He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
BOND: Was this all about the oil?
ELEKTRA: It is my oil! Mine and my family’s!
ELEKTRA: It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I’m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.
BOND: No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
