ELLIOT: Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this! Kandi, you gotta help me.
KANDI: What can I do?
ELLIOT: You gotta hold this for me.
KANDI: You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
ELLIOT: Just put it in your purse.
KANDI: I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
ELLIOT: They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
KANDI: No way, Jos√à.
ELLIOT: Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
KANDI: I'm not wearing a bra.
ELLIOT: Put it in your pants.
KANDI: No.
ELLIOT: You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
KANDI: Read my lips.
