Buck converters I have seen many high watt like 1200 or 1500 watt boost converters and not a buck converter with that high wattage or power rating . I'm planning to make one buck converter (input- 35 volts output-3 to 35 volts current -30amp max and adjustable ) but is there any restrictions to the power of a buck converter or are there any certain limitation to the current it can output.(I dont want to buy any discrete buck converter ic. I intend to use typical pwm chips like uc38xx ,tl494 etc or even opamps)???
