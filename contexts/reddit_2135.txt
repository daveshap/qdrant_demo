Update: I didn't give up
Writing this is pretty surreal. Usually I come on here to look at some fire memes, but I feel like I needed to write this post after the post that I wrote.

***Some personal updates within the 24 hours:***

\- Found my passports, social security card (I didn't know my number, but will memorize it), and some other documents (got all of them scanned & will hide it somewhere else)

\- Wrote an email to colleges about the procedure to appealing aid (I don't know exactly what to do as a lot of people write about getting their request rejected, not on the procedure itself)

\- Looked at the scholarship list (thanks u/lune-etoile), found one scholarship that is for me! (going to see my principal soon so she can write me a letter of recommendation)

\- My friend's mom offered me two part time jobs tutoring kids (big plus since I only work 6hrs/week rn) It also coincides on the time the job that my mom was forcing me to do, so yay!

~~- Also got a new bank account (kakaobank), but apparently it's a limited bank account(한도제한계좌)? Fellow Koreans please come through as in how to change this? 어떤 서류 필요해요??~~

Don't worry guys, again, I'm used to this. This ain't my first rodeo. Also, I didn't withdraw from any colleges, if you guys were wondering. Thank god I hesitated, otherwise, I would've lost everything. I have 6 colleges to hear back from this week (I think).

And thanks for the nice & helpful comments. ***You guys really made my day.***

p.s. If you guys have other scholarships/schools that I could apply to, please let me know. I'm a U.S. dual citizen (Korean/U.S. citizen) currently living in Korea. My major is biomedical engineering/bio-engineering.

p.s.s. I'm trying to buy a new laptop by saving some of my money. When should I buy it? Should I get it asap or buy it once I'm on campus?

***update***: hey guys, thanks for reaching out. sorry if I don’t reply to your DMs fast enough. I’m cleaning the house right now 😂😂 Having a dog is pretty messy.

A lot of you guys have told me to try filing for dependency override, but I still have my dad who’s income is way bigger than moms (cuz she got her hours cut for getting a face lift lol). So I don’t think that will work.

Right now, I emailed the colleges, as most of them seemed to close their campuses. Also the time difference makes it super hard for me to call them. But nonetheless, I will call them sooner or later.

***Also, no need to venmo/paypal me***. Instead, please donate to the red cross or a respectable health organization. I need this corona gone, so my hours can be extended (I currently teach 2 kids English, but my boss said that when schools start again, I should expect to get more hours).

And by the way, my name isn’t Matt. I use a pseudonym online (so I can protect my privacy). I know some yall been askin, but I ain’t gonna tell you my name 😐 Sorry, I just don’t feel comfortable with my whole identity online.
