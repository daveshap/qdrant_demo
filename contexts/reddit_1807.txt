Anyone else feel like they’re not physically ready to take these AP Exams
Idk, it just seems like everytime I try to do a DBQ for APUSH I just blank out even though those were some of my best essays. It just feels so rushed this year, like even though we’ve been learning all year we’re not prepared.

Obviously I’m trying to prepare, but especially having taken AP Lit first semester, I just have no idea how I’m gonna do. Hopefully I’ll get an easy question :(
