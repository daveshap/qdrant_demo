COLONEL: There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
PASTOR COLLINS: So is the town, I notice!
COLONEL: I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
PASTOR COLLINS: I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
COLONEL: General Mann -- I was told to expect you, sir. I'm Colonel Heffner.
GENERAL MANN: I'm here to make up a report, not to interfere with the operations you've set up. You're still in command. Clayton Forrester! I haven't seen you since Oak Ridge.
CLAYTON: Good to see you, General. This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense. Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
SYLVIA: Would you like some coffee, General?
