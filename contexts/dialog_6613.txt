LETTY: But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
DR. EMLEE: Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
LETTY: I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
DR. EMLEE: Then, you should call.
LETTY: What?
DR. EMLEE: I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
LETTY: Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
MRS. MAYER: Must you walk so quickly?
LETTY: It's good exercise, Mom.
MRS. MAYER: I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
LETTY: I've already made arrangements.
LETTY: Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
MRS. MAYER: Not even if it's something positive?
