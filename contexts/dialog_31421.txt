HANNAH GREEN: Grady!
HANNAH GREEN: I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
GRADY: No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
HANNAH GREEN: I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
GRADY: Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
HANNAH GREEN: He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
GRADY: Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?

GRADY: Jesus.
HANNAH GREEN: Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
GRADY: Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
HANNAH GREEN: Who does?
