EPPS: I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
DODGE: A what?
EPPS: I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain. What happened up there?
DODGE: I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
