555 timer circuitry I have a 555 pulse generator controlling a relay going a little faster than 1hz. It  is hooked up to start up when it receives positive voltage from the switched accessory circuit of a vehicle. That much works fine, but I would like to limit the number of pulses it puts out to around 15 or so, and then stop until the next time the vehicle is switched back on. Using another 555 chip, I thought about making a \"one-shot\" pulse generator to control the first one, but it seems that this circuit requires a negative pulse to initiate it. That doesn't quite work for the automated status that I require. Any thoughts?
