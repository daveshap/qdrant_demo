I saw a memo about my upcoming termination. What should I do now?
I was called into a unexpected meeting with my new president and HR. Issues raised during the meeting included concerns that I was unhappy with the company, my negative attitude, and poor performance. Specifics wouldn't be shared with me. 

While I have been indeed unhappy with the new leadership, I've never let it show or affect my performance. I suspect it's the new president's paranoia that put me under his radar. He has had problems with staff in the past. 

I brought up the meeting with my other managers. They were shocked at the news and told me that they didn't think a fair assessment was done. I've been going exceeding expectations as far as they are aware. There's also not much they can do. While speaking with them I saw a memo on their computers that if changes in performance weren't made in the next 3 business days, I would be let go. Not a lot of time for remediation. 

I'm unsure how to proceed. I am a top performer and have been taking up responsibilities that no one else can to ensure success of the company. 
While I still have assess to their systems, what data should I back up? How can I prepare for a wrongful termination?
