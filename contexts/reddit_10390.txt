I sleep a lot so I don't have to deal with being awake
I'm tired. I'm tired of being tired. Today I found out I am royally fucked. My graduate project is faced with ballooning expenses and department politics just cost me 2 department grants I desperately needed. One of them was straight up given to a guy who doesn't even know what his project is, when the fucking grant requires a detailed research plan. I worked weeks on these fucking grants because I knew they were important. I got a paltry sum from some consolation prize. It's nowhere near enough. 

My advisor wrote both my rec letter and the other guys'. I don't think he has any faith in me if this is the outcome. I'm fucked and so is my career. I feel completely betrayed. 

I've had enough of this shit. I'm tired of throwing out all my energy and effort into a system that doesn't care. I want to go to bed, but I have to keep working. 

This program took my love of science through a meat grinder and I have another year to go, unless I withdraw and lose everything.
