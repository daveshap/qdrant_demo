Corona and conductor We are decreasing corona by increasing conductor size and making it hollow but according to definition corona depends on level of voltage so eventhough you make it hollow and increase conductor size there won\u2019t be any change in voltage transmitted so I didn\u2019t get the fact how corona decreases by conductor size.Some say it is because of potential gradient, others say skin effectSkin effect - current flows around the conductor not at the centre so if we increase the hollowness of conductor Is it possible that more air will be prone to ionise than before?
