RAILLY: Does that disturb you, James? Thinking about that little boy in the well?
COLE: When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
RAILLY: What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
COLE: Nevermind. It's not real -- it's a hoax. A prank. He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here. Left!
