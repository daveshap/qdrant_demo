Can I cancel the flight you are already on board but still at the gate? This is a hypothetical question and I would like to know the passenger's rights.If an airline company treats you poorly and you wish to fly with another company OR if your flight is having a technical problem and you start doubting reliability of the aircraft while boarding.There could be various reasons that you might feel uncomfortable to spend the time with the airline.  Does the airline allow a passenger to leave the flight regardless of any reason? And if the company admits their fault then do they refund the fee to the leaving customer?
