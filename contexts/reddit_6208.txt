Got the job. Start in a month, but invited to team holiday outing on Monday. What should I expect?
Hi all. Happy to say, I got a great job after taking a risk and quitting my last job without anything lined up. Last job was hell, but this job seems to be a significant upgrade in responsibility, salary, growth opportunity and benefits. Everything has been signed and submitted and my start date is Jan 15.

While accepting the offer, the team manager invited me to their team holiday outing this year. I enjoyed meeting everyone I met and interviewed with throughout the process so I graciously accepted, but now that its approaching I guess my imposter syndrome is kicking in slightly. 

I'll be meeting and hanging out with the whole team for 3 hours. Dinner and some team building event after. Should I prepare somewhat similar to an interview? I know I wont be expected to know much more than what I learned in the hiring process, abd I doubt I'll get any interview questions like "what are your weaknesses?" but a little voice inside me keeps saying I shouldn't go into this thinking it's just a social gathering for me, even though it is for them. I'll be the new stranger.

Any advice? Also the company dress code is pretty casual, but I've been suited up every time I've met with them. What should I wear? My usual casual is band tshirts and Jean's with holes in them. I'm thinking of wearing nicer casual clothes like nice Jean's and a polo.

Any advice or go-to get to know you talking points would be appreciated. I may be over thinking this, but I'd hate to lose the job because I wasnt socially prepared and some higher up forms a bad impression of me for some reason.
