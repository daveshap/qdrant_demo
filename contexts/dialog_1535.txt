SERAFINE: We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
ANDY: No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal? Shake a paw?
SERAFINE: I know where he'll go.
ANDY: Where?
SERAFINE: Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
