FOLLETT: What is it?
MUMFORD: It's a thought I had.
FOLLETT: Should I open it now?
MUMFORD: Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
FOLLETT: What exactly is it supposed to do?
MUMFORD: You remember when I asked you about pornography --
FOLLETT: -- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
MUMFORD: -- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
FOLLETT: -- Which I don't necessarily agree.
MUMFORD: But you did come to me.
MUMFORD: My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
FOLLETT: And the experiment is in here?
