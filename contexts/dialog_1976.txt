VIKING BOB: I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
LEMALLE: Get the fuck out of here.
VIKING BOB: It's a three-hour flight. They shoulda got there yesterday.
LEMALLE: Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
MITCHELL: Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
VIKING BOB: That plane might've been to throw us off the track. Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
