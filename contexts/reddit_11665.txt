In love with fictional character
I'm in love with a fictional character but of course the character isn't real.... How can I make it feel like that I'm in a relationship with that character? Because I cry every day that he isn't real. Would making a doll of him help? There's sadly no body pillow of him because he isn't a popular character (I know I'm one of those weird people but whatever. Nobody is perfect)
