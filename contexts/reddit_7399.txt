Academic Probation after 2 Semesters in grad school. Need Help
A bit of background. I am a Aerospace master student.

I came to US for masters and at first I had good hopes of learning new things. As I got here, everything was different and it took me a lot of time to figure out. Before coming here I spoke to a professor for advising and he agreed. When I got here, he said he cannot take me in his group. I was devastated at first and I approached a different professor. He also said NO. This took a huge toll on my mental health and it affected my grades in first Semester. I was under a lot of stress. Two subjects were basically PhD class with I'm the only Master student. It was really hard to cope up. i ended up with C's.

I got 1.9 in first Semester. I was placed in Academic probation. I had to get my GPA above 3 to avoid probation.

For second Semester, I studied very hard and got 3.7 GPA. Thus my cumulative GPA is 2.8. This is not enough. So in the end of one year, I'm in academic probation and no advisor yet. With the stress I'm going through, I can't think straight.

I cannot drop out otherwise I'll be homeless.

I need some advise on how to deal with this. Thank you

I had very good Undergrad, I have a publication and patent. Now I'm in this situation. How do I fix this. Kindly help
