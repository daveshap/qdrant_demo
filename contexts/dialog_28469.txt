DOROTHY: Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
WYNANT: Yes, she would.
DOROTHY: I hate all that fuss. But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
WYNANT: What would your mother say to that?
DOROTHY: This is my wedding.
WYNANT: Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ... all of us there ... your other and me and your stepfather?
DOROTHY: He can stay home. Please, Dad, won't you?
WYNANT: If you think it'll be all right.
WYNANT: Wait a minute. When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
DOROTHY: Where are you going?
WYNANT: It's a secret. I can't even tell you, my dear. I've got an important idea to work on.
DOROTHY: A new invention?
WYNANT: Yes. And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
DOROTHY: We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
WYNANT: Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
DOROTHY: It's a promise?
WYNANT: That's one thing I won't forget. Where's Macaulay? I ought to be starting.
WYNANT: How's your brother?
DOROTHY: He's all right.
WYNANT: I'd like to see him. Why don't you bring him down?
DOROTHY: You know how it is, Dad. He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
WYNANT: I know -- I know --
DOROTHY: You're not missing much. He's cuckoo.
WYNANT: Like all the rest of us. Has this fellow... ...has he seen the whole family?
DOROTHY: And he still wants to marry me!
WYNANT: He's a brave man.
ANDREW: I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
DOROTHY: Look -- those are the first metals that came through.
DOROTHY: Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
WYNANT: Only in bad weather.
DOROTHY: But it isn't bad weather now.
WYNANT: Better get home before it is.
DOROTHY: Goodbye, darling. Don't you dare forget... December 30th.
WYNANT: Goodbye, my boy. Take care of Dorothy. Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
