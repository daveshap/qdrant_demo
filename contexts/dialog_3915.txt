HELEN: Calvin?!
CALVIN: Right here!
HELEN: We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
CALVIN: Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
HELEN: Why?
CALVIN: No reason. Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance. Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
HELEN: Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
CALVIN: Yes. Well... yes.
HELEN: Watch this!
CALVIN: What?
