WANDA: What happened?
CASTOR: What the fuck do you think happened? Castor Troy just shot him! What are you waiting for? GO!
ARCHER: And this thing can grow it?
DIETRICH: Yes. Pollux bought one along with the original batch. Obviously, he found a way to make more.
ARCHER: Why would he need more?
DIETRICH: He's your brother, you figure it out. Maybe he made another bomb.
ARCHER: Or reactivated the first one.
DIETRICH: Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
LAZARRO: I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
CASTOR: What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
LAZARRO: I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
CASTOR: No. Most of them are in transit by now. I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
LAZARRO: Okay, then. I leave it in your able hands.
