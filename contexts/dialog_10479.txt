WASHINGTON: Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
BILLY LEE: I ain't forgot about the freedom.
WASHINGTON: Well, what have you thought?
BILLY LEE: Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk. So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
WASHINGTON: Well, this must be about something!
NATHANAEL GREENE: It is; we need you George.
HAMILTON: Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
WASHINGTON: I'm not sure.
HAMILTON: George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
WASHINGTON: But it's more than just that, am I right?
NATHANAEL GREENE: If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country. They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
WASHINGTON: You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire. I don't need to be in government.
HAMILTON: That's why the people trust you George. Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it?
WASHINGTON: You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king? Not a dictator over subjects?
