NINOTCHKA: You, please.
LEON: Me?
NINOTCHKA: Yes. Could you give me some information?
LEON: Gladly.
NINOTCHKA: How long do we have to wait here?
LEON: Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
NINOTCHKA: At what intervals does he whistle?
LEON: What?
NINOTCHKA: How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
LEON: That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
NINOTCHKA: Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
LEON: Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
NINOTCHKA: In other words you don't know.
LEON: No.
NINOTCHKA: Thank you.
LEON: You're welcome.
LEON: Can I help you?
NINOTCHKA: You might hold this for me.
LEON: Love to.
NINOTCHKA: Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
LEON: Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
NINOTCHKA: No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
LEON: Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
NINOTCHKA: I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
LEON: Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
NINOTCHKA: How long does it take a man to land?
LEON: Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it! Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
NINOTCHKA: Why do you need my finger?
LEON: Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
NINOTCHKA: And where are we?
LEON: Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
NINOTCHKA: I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
LEON: I don't have to but I find it natural.
NINOTCHKA: Suppress it.
LEON: I'll try.
NINOTCHKA: For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
LEON: Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
NINOTCHKA: You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
LEON: Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
NINOTCHKA: I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
LEON: A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
NINOTCHKA: Your type will soon be extinct.
