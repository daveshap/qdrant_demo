What kind of capacitor might this be? Value? I am trying to duplicate a simple 556 circuit, this capacitor works, but when I try to substitute another cap, it doesn't work.  I need to order a couple dozen of these but want to order the right thing:)  tha cal in question is the flat green one with 103k in the number.I tried to measure this cap with my vom, and it read .025n.I dont know , that is accurate, since the .025n stays on my meter display with other components and wont zero out till I change away from capacitance and back again.Thanks,Dan
