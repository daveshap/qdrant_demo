Automating row selection and update of attributes in ArcPy? I'm looking for a solution to automate a process I have found myself re-doing manually quite often. I have a dataset that consists of one column named \"quarter\" that is formatted \"2018 Q1\" (or Q3, or Q4, etc, going from 2016 to 2050) and several thousand rows. What I need to do is to select only the numeric part of that field and put it in a new field called \"year.\" Once this is done, I need to split the layer into new shapefiles; one for every year. I've tried ModelBuilder but I just don't understand the workflow and can't get it to work.If anyone has python script that does something similar to this I can try changing it.
