CATHY: Good night, Oliver.
OLIVER: Sleep well.
CATHY: You're not leaving tomorrow..?
OLIVER: I think not.
GENERAL: Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
OLIVER: But the war, the army —— they need you.
GENERAL: Better no general than one carrying the plague.
OLIVER: We still don't know that it's the plague ——
GENERAL: Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
OLIVER: I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
ALBRECHT: Or even spirit messages from the next world.
