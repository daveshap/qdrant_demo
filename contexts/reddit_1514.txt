Have a positive day, you’re stronger than you know
Just sending positive vibes to everyone here. We all know how frustrating and exhausting anxiety can be, don’t let that discourage you. You’re so much stronger and you have so much more life in you than anxiety will ever tell you. It’ll discourage you from living your life today. Live your life anyway! 

I get bored at work so if anyone is having trouble feel free to comment/dm and I’ll at least send my regards even if I have no answers for you.
