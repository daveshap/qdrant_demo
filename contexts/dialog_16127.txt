GEORGE: It's not breakfast yet.
ROBIN: I dreamed about your house last night.
GEORGE: Finished or unfinished?
ROBIN: It was perfect, George. Amazing. It was so real.
GEORGE: Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
ROBIN: That wasn't a dream. That was Sam.
GEORGE: Oh...with his ear infection!
ROBIN: My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
GEORGE: Go in there and lick his attitude.
ROBIN: The antibiotics weren't working. It's what I believe, George.
