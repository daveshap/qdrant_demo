MR. T: Hello?
COLE: Mr. Thomerson.
MR. T: Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
COLE: Yes I did.
MR. T: Fine. How's everything going?
COLE: Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
MR. THOMERSON: So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game. Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
COLE: What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
COLE: Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
MR. THOMERSON: Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
COLE: Right. Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
MR. THOMERSON: Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling... Shut up, I'm talking here. Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
