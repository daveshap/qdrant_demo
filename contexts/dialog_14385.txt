GEARY: You mind? I'm eating, huh?
JACOB: Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
GEARY: I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
JACOB: Used you?
GEARY: I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
JACOB: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
GEARY: It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
JACOB: War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
GEARY: I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
