NASPA Help!
I’m working on the grad summer internship application and am struggling with the last question, What innovative program would you develop for grad and new professionals that follows a current trend?

I’ve met with professors, Assistant Directors, and have not had much luck formulating an idea. 

I’m looking for advice and inspiration, thank you!
