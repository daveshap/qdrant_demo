Current Ph.D student. Considering stopping this and transitioning into something like an academic advising role.
Hi /r/studentaffairs!

The title gives you a general idea of the situation I am wondering about but I would love to hear any advice or thoughts you all might have as to whether or not the situation I am considering sounds feasible.

&nbsp;

Some background, I am currently in the second year of my communication and journalism Ph.d program and I have, over the past few months, come to realize that I don't think this is for me. I realized that, when I started my master's program in 2016, I was excited to teach because I wanted to play a meaningful role in the lives of students as they work to make their education *theirs*. However, over the past three and a half years of teaching I didn't quite feel like I got to play the role I wanted to as an instructor. That is to say, I enjoyed teaching and interacting with students, but I didn't feel like I had the opportunity to help students think deeply and critically about why the are working towards a degree and how they can feel a sense of ownership over both their own education as well as the reason they decided to attend college in the first place.

Having gone to community college and worked my way all the way to a paid for Ph.d program, I realized that a lot of the reason I decided to come to this program was because I wasn't sure what to do next or what role I wanted to play as a professional. All of that said I came to the realization that my own experiences as a sort of high-achieving but listless student, combined with the joy I take in helping others understand how they can bring together their strengths and their goals, are why I was excited to teach in grad school. But I only ever thought about it through a teaching lens until recently.

&nbsp;

Anyhow, the main question I want to ask is whether or not trying to transition into academic advising currently seems feasible given my experiences over the course of my graduate program. I'll provide a quick sketch of the things I think (not being super informed yet) make me a potentially decent fit:

- I have 3 years of small class, college-level teaching experience ranging from introductory classes of mostly first year students to upper level classes of juniors and seniors

- I have 2 years of experience working in the communication center at my master's institution as a communication consultant. I worked both 1:1 with students as well as with groups of students on everything from developing speeches to practicing putting thoughts in order and evaluating their own public speaking experiences. I also worked with instructors to design classes around projects focused on critical thinking, debate, and presentation skills that they could bring into their intended careers.

- As a part of the Ph.d program I am attending I became an adviser for the students in our major helping them navigate both the requirements for the majors and minors in our department (3 majors and 2 minors all told) as well as their general education requirements. By the time I finish next semester I will have 1 year of advising experience at a 4 year institution under my belt.

- I have an undergraduate degree, as well as a master's degree, in communication studies with a focus in advocacy. While I know this may not be a direct correlation to advising/student affairs I feel that I could still fit?

- While this may seem simple I am fairly tech savy. I was at one point A+ certified and, while it has lapsed (I didn't pursue a career where it would be central) I have maintained a consistent connection with technology my whole life (also having had to use it regularly in an educational context).

&nbsp;

Those are the big reasons I'm wondering if I could feasibly make the transition to advising or student affairs. Like I said, I am really looking for advice as to whether the skillset I have cultivated over the past few years would be applicable in advising/student affairs. I really don't mind starting off at a lower level/entry position either. Having been a student most of my life though, it is hard to picture not continuing along the academic track to teaching. That's why I'm seeking advice from folks with a different perspective.

Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this and respond!
