SAM: No one would blame me if I left!
GEORGE: I'd blame you. I want you here.
SAM: I'm not doing it!
GEORGE: It'll be fine.
SAM: Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
GEORGE: I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
GEORGE: I don't beg.
SAM: And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
GEORGE: I can promise you complete privacy.
SAM: You can't promise me anything! You don't have anything to promise! You live in a garage! You don't have cable! You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer! You don't have a job!
