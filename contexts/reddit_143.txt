Why do I (F16) find it difficult to be happy?
I’ve been struggling with this problem for a while now. A while in being about 6 years (so from the age of 10).

I’ve been in two online relationships that have both failed and can’t seem to get over either boy 100% and wish they could both still be in my life. The thought of not having my most recent ex (M18) seems to bother me so much more than it did when I broke up with the first boy, and I don’t understand why? Was that actually love? Was I just attached? Is love just an attachment and have I ever felt real love? 

I feel asthough Im an idiot for caring about these two boys that I met through a game so much, like I care about them more than I care about myself even now that neither are in my life. Todays the first time since the begining of the year that I’ve really felt alone and I think its because valentines day just passed but even then, I shouldn’t feel so unhappy in my own company on a normal Saturday. 

My life consists of: 
- being alone in my room
- listening to music 
- smoking weed 
- writing stupid stories on my computer
None of these things have particularly helped with my mood swings, how uphappy i am or my social anxiety and probably never will. But it stops me from thinking sometimes which is nice. I stop thinking about my exes. I stop thinking of how much of a disappointment I am (for example today I over slept and missed my job interview). I stop thinking about wanting to be dead so Im not in anyones shot at happiness. And thats how I’ve always been. 

I saw CAMHs the other week which didn’t help at all (I went about 3 years ago after attempting suicide but that time was much worse, I couldnt get a word in). Since then I haven’t gone to college because honestly I dont know. 
I feel asthough my friends are disappointed in me for not coming in and asking to link. I feel asthough my family’s disappointed in me because I cant get to college, because I over sleep, because I cant sleep at night. 

All I want to do is be happy and the only time Im happy is when Im with someone. I rely on someone to make me happy and I dont know how to get out of that. Before its too late and I’m completely lost and gone.
