How to handle 1st round HR salary expectation rush?
Typically my past internships and jobs had fixed rate salaries, so there typically were no need for negotiations. I'm looking for a switch and almost always HRs ask me for salary expectation which I try to evade, but then HRs push me with annoyance sensible from the other side of the phone. It could be their tactics, but I really wanted to know how I'm supposed to handle expectations as I was trained not to never reveal salaries first. Thank you.
