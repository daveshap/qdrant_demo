CRAWFORD: When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it? That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
CLARICE: It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
CRAWFORD: Point taken.
CRAWFORD: When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
CLARICE: I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
CRAWFORD: The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
CLARICE: Then have the lab check Raspail's head. Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
CRAWFORD: You seem pretty sure of that.
CLARICE: Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
