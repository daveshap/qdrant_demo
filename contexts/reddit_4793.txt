Why do I keep losing friends?
I’m convinced everyone hates me I’m so worthless and stupid and ugly and undesirable all I do is complain and be sad and hurt but even the people who “care” about me just leave me it doesn’t matter who no matter how sweet I just scare them off idk why but they just block me and ignore me and even some make fun of me I just want a friend I just want to feel wanted
