I just got kicked out of my PhD program.
Four years in. Neuropsychoharmacology. None of my experiments worked in four years of 10-hour 7-day weeks, habit researcher who never observed habits. Three shitty committee meetings where they shot down three proposals in a row without a hint of mercy over 5 months was all it took to make a third of my life irrelevant. Supervisor sat back and watched it happen with popcorn. I'm just so lost and sad and scared. Looking for a kind voice? What do I even put on my resume?
