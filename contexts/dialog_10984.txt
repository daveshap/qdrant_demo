WILLIAMSON: I wish I could.
LEVENE: You fucking asshole. I haven't got it. I haven't got it, John. I'll pay you tomorrow. I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow. I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
WILLIAMSON: Can't do it.
LEVENE: I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow. I've got it at the hotel. John? We do that, for chrissake?
WILLIAMSON: No.

WILLIAMSON: I have to go...
LEVENE: Wait. Alright. Fine. The one. Give me the lead. Give me the one lead. The best one you have.

LEVENE: Yeah. Yeah.
WILLIAMSON: Is that what you're saying?
LEVENE: That's what I'm saying. Yeah. I'd like something off the other list. Which, very least, that I'm entitled to. If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am. What? I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
WILLIAMSON: That's alright.
LEVENE: The deal still stands, our other thing.
