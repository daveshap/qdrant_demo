What are the chances that the person whose email I need to send my CV and cover letter to is the one who will read it?
There is this job advert I want to apply to and the deadline is tomorrow. The advert says send the CV and cover letter to... and here is the email that basically looks like this: [name.lastname@company.co.uk](mailto:name.lastname@company.co.uk).

I found this company on LinkedIn and apparently they have less than 10 employees and I found the one from the email. He's been working there for 3 years but it says he's a software developer. Nothing about him being a recruiter or anything.

Is it possible that because the company is so small he is actually the recruiter? I feel like with such small companies, it should be the owner and it's definitely not him.

Is it safe to address my cover letter to him? Or should I do the unspeakable and address it "To Whom It May Concern"? I know it's a bad thing but it worked last time I tried...

It's Saturday and no time to call the company or anything, I just found this advert and I wanna try.
