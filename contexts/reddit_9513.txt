Dont sleep on tofu! It is about as much nutrition for your buck as you can get!
Tofu gets a bad rap because people hate vegans so much (full disclosure: am vegan), but at $2/lb you cant do a whole lot better in terms of [nutrition](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/ingredient-focus-tofu)

It has basically no flavor but will absorb the flavor of whatever you want. Theres thousands of recipies out there. Try one! Even if its just adding cubes to your vegetable soup.
