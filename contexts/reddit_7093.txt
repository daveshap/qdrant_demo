Potential Job with a Startup at Series C funding
Hello, there's a chance I land a job with a startup that has gone through their Series C funding (in the Bay Area). I have been work for Mid/High Cap companies my entire career so I'm not familiar with working for a startup. I was told that lower salary is expected in exchange for potential future equity in case the company goes IPO. 

I had received an offer letter before that gave me 25k stocks (RSU) but turned it down (later the company was bought at U$2/stock). At that time I was offered a slight increase compared to my base salary then, but I was relocating from a place where salary range is lower than the Bay Area.

My questions are:

1. How much roughly (in percentage) lower on base salary do startups usually pay compared to established, usually public, company? 
2. This one is probably hard to answer, but just an estimated range, how much usually a startup stock worth when they bought out or goes IPO? I was told the usual range is between U$1 to U$4 per stock (in the Bay Area at least).
3. If I end up getting an offer, what else should I expect differently from an offer from a more established company?

Thanks!
