Today I made it to 21
I made promises to myself that I would not make it to see today. But after 3 suicide attempts, 4 psychiatrists, 2 weeks in hospital, and four different mental health diagnoses (and that’s just over the last year) I am finally doing well and would consider myself healthy. I don’t constantly want to be dead anymore. It took work but things can get better. Please keep trying!
