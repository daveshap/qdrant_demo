PhD students demands my source articles as PDF-documents
Hello,

I'm a master's student and I handed in a paper with one of my department's phd students as part of a class. This is a sort of replacement task as I couldn't complete a class of his professor's last year so there's no other students involved in this.


When I handed the paper in, he replied to tell me he requires all cited articles as PDF-documents. This sounds nothing like standard practice to me. Many of the articles are copyrighted and only available through a valid Elsevier subscription.

When I addressed these concerns with him he simply replied "Thanks, I'm looking forward to reading the documents!", not acknowledging my questions at all.


Is this normal? Because I'm feeling uncomfortable infringing on someone's copyright so my supervisor has an easier time writing his own PhD thesis (on the same topic).
