CHARLIE: I'll bet!
MAVERICK: Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
CHARLIE: Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
CHARLIE: Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
MAVERICK: It's not that.
CHARLIE: It isn't?
MAVERICK: Well, it is. It is that, too.
CHARLIE: That's a big comfort to me.
MAVERICK: I could be, too.
CHARLIE: How so?
MAVERICK: Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
CHARLIE: And on to a bigger one with you?
MAVERICK: Yeah, most likely.
CHARLIE: Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
MAVERICK: I heard of one once.
