How does the Attack stat affect damage calculation? I have been having problems trying to figure out how the Attack stats work for Pok\u00e9mon Red Rescue Team.I have a Lv. 44 Swampert, with around 70 Attack. I also have a Lv. 26 Kyogre (last time I checked), with around the same amount of attack. The thing is, in the Magma Cavern dungeon, my Swampert does ~50-55 damage. My Kyogre does, in the same dungeon, ~25-30 damage.Are there secret attack stats that I'm missing somewhere?
