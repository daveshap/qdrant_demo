VIJAY: Hey man.
BLEEKER: Oh, hey Vijay.
VIJAY: Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
BLEEKER: Yup.
VIJAY: Just like our moms and teachers!
BLEEKER: Yup.
VIJAY: Did you hear it's yours?
BLEEKER: Yup.
VIJAY: What a trip, man.
BLEEKER: I don't really know anything about it.
VIJAY: You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
BLEEKER: I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
VIJAY: Me neither. But I'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count. See you.
BLEEKER: Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
JUNO: Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
BLEEKER: Okay, cool.
JUNO: I'll try to drop by later.
