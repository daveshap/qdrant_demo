DENHERDER: You wanna call it a night after here?
CHARLIE: It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
DENHERDER: Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
DENHERDER: Leg of lamb this time?
CHARLIE: Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
DENHERDER: We're blowin' half the bounty on bait --
DENHERDER: One more after this, then I'm going home.
CHARLIE: Set?
