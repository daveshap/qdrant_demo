HELEN: Where are you going?
DANA: Out. If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
HELEN: No you're not. You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
DANA: Mom, wake up! Dad barely knows we exist.
HELEN: That's not true, honey--
DANA: It is true! He doesn't know anything about me. He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something. As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine. But it's not fine. Nothing's fine.
