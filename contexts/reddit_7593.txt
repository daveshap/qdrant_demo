Seeking: Job Advice while Applying for Grad School
Hello friends! This is my first time posting here, so my apologies if this type of post is not welcome. I am currently applying for my PhD in Depth Psychology. My previous employment (unrelated to the psychology field) has been terminated due to COVID, so I wanted to take advantage of this time to apply for new jobs that would help me in my program and prepare me for my career.

What kinds of jobs are you holding down in grad school? Are they related to your field? Has anyone worked as a personal assistant to someone whose work they admired? If so, how did it go? What is a realistic expectation for working while in grad school?

P.S. I am interested in studying Eco-Psychology, Community Psychology, holistic therapies (hypnotherapy, energy work, and alternative medicine) if that helps.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I am in the US
