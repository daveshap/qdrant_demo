No school for a month because of Coronavirus outbreak.
It’s SARS all over again but worse. School is now suspended until March 2nd for us in Hong Kong. This just had to happen during a critical time for the Class of 2020 (since we’re sitting our exams soon) and students in general -
not to mention HK has already experienced multiple disruptions this year :/

Stay healthy everyone.
