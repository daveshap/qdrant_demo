Function of fractions in NPs + form of subsequent verb I have two questions about the clause two thirds of the book deals with WWII:i) how do we analyse the subject of this clause from a syntactic point of view? I'd analyse it as a NP, with the following internal structure: two (determiner [numeral]) thirds (head [noun]) of the book (postmodifier [PP]). Is this correct, or should it be analysed in a different way, and in that case, how?ii) if the analysis suggested in (i) is correct, then why do we have the singular form on the verb (deals)?Thanks!
