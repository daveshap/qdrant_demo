How to transfer files from remote ubuntu server to remote ubuntu server? I have tried TeamViewer, AnyDesk, NitroShare and by torrents to transfer my files to a new server. TeamViewer did not connect, NitroShare is for local computers and by torrents does not work because no seeds. I have tried with trackers but also did not work.Since I am desperate because I have 2 hours to migrate the files, I came for help here, if you have any method to transferI have also searched for similar questions but all are about local computersI use Ubuntu 16.04And is a 70GiB folder
