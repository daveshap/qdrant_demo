Wife is depressed and I need advice
My wife and I have been married for 8 years, but she’s been dealing with depression for the past 10 months. These last 2 weeks are just a mental roller coaster with her crying all the time and saying that she feels empty. I try to cheer her up by taking her out to different activities, walking and playing with our dogs, telling jokes to make her laugh, and everything else that I’ve been doing as a husband during our marriage. During her current depressive episode, she admitted to me that she took 8 sleeping pills instead of the 2 recommended per the prescription, which only made her drowsy the next day. I am conflicted on what to do because she doesn’t want to touch me or me touching her and she always just wants to be alone, even the dogs can’t cheer her up. I’m at my breaking point trying to walk this line and not say something that I would regret, but I need advice on what to do. I love her very much, but it is very stressful dealing with someone who doesn’t want to meet me in the middle.

Edit: I forgot to mention, she is already seeing a psychiatrist and that is who prescribed the sleeping pills.
