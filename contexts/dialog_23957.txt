UNCLE AL: Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
MARTY: Yeah, I know. It's great!
UNCLE AL: One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
MARTY: Yeah... sure.
UNCLE AL: Save this one for last.
MARTY: What is it?
UNCLE AL: A tracer. You'll like it.
MARTY: Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
UNCLE AL: You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
