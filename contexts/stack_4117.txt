Are AMEX cards accepted in Universal Studios JPN & Pokemon Centers? Is the JCB/AMEX partnership applicable anywhere? I'm traveling to Japan in the next few months and wanted to know if these two locations accept American Express credit cards.I also saw that JCB has a partnership with AMEX but information is scarce. Does anyone know if an establishment accepts JCB it will also accept AMEX?Thank you for your help.
