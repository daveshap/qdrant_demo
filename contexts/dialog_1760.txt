LARRY KING: That's gotta kill him, right?
CYBER PUNDIT: Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
LARRY KING: Outpost doesn't own em.
CYBER PUNDIT: Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
LARRY KING: That'd change with a criminal indictment.
CYBER PUNDIT: There's no hard evidence he knew about this. Anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished.
LARRY KING: Isn't there a stigma? Bankrolling this guy?
CYBER PUNDIT: Stigma? Larry! 60 billion buys you some slack in this world.
LARRY KING: And the kid who wrote Skywire -- then gave it away? They're calling him the digital Robin Hood.
CYBER PUNDIT: Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
LARRY KING: We tried!
CYBER PUNDIT: You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
