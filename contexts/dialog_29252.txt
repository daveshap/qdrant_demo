HARRY: Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
SUZIE: He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
HARRY: I hope that it's nothing serious.
SUZIE: He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
HARRY: Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
SUZIE: Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
HARRY: You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
