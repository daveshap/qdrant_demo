Is it alright for a 15M to have a wall full of posters?
My family recently moved in an apartment and I have put up a lot of posters from my passions (guitar, rock, soccer and basketball) To the extent that one of my walls is fully covered. Ik i am reaching an age where i can start hosting parties or invite people over. Would it be alright to still have posters when starting to become an adult. I really like the way it looks but if it means i will be made fun of or miss out on opportunities with the ladies i am willing to stick to a more "boring" theme.
