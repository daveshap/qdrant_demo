MACKELWAY: I don't think you understand.
SALINAS: What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
MACKELWAY: Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
SALINAS: Perhaps you can explain it to him. It's Agent Mackelway.
KOESSLER: He's got you believing in Zero now too.
MACKELWAY: I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
KOESSLER: Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
MACKELWAY: I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
KOESSLER: We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
MACKELWAY: What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
KOESSLER: Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
MACKELWAY: There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
KOESSLER: Dick Low's a killer too.
MACKELWAY: You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
