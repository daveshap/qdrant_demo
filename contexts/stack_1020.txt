How to effectively deploy MAAS server inside the KVM with 2 interfaces and bridge them with physical host server? I have two servers on which I want to deploy MAAS and commission VM nodes. I don't have any physical small server with two interfaces (public and private), so I decided to deploy MAAS server inside the KVM. I am unable to create two interfaces in MAAS KVM i.e., Private for the nodes and Public for the internet. Do i have to create two Virtual Networks in virt-manager for two interfaces of MAAS server KVM? How am I supposed to connect nodes(other VMs) with private network and expose them remotely?I'm Stuck in this, it would be great if anyone could help me resolving these confusions?
