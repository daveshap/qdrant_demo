ADAM: Hey, Eve!
EVE: Have you ever heard the saying, He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?""
ADAM: Yep. You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
EVE: Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
ADAM: I certainly do!
EVE: Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
ADAM: No it's not!
EVE: Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
ADAM: Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
EVE: Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
ADAM: Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
EVE: Well...yeah. Okay.
