LAURIE: Jon -- there's something I have to know. Did you love me once?
DR. MANHATTAN: Yes, I loved you. I left the earth when I lost you.
LAURIE: Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer. Just be being with me.
DR. MANHATTAN: I didn't give you cancer, Laurie. Not you, not the others. I don't know what did.
LAURIE: But you knew that I'd -- die.
DR. MANHATTAN: Memories of the future are just like any others. I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . . You won't die of cancer, Laurie. There won't be time for that.
LAURIE: Then it's going to happen. The world's going to end. -- And you've always known.
DR. MANHATTAN: Always. Ever since the day I died.
LAURIE: Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
DR. MANHATTAN: Because --
LAURIE: Because you can't, I know, it's preordained. So sorry. I forgot. Jon. This, this script" you're following . . . who writes it?"
DR. MANHATTAN: I don't know yet. I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
LAURIE: I can't stand any more of this. I want to go back. If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
DR. MANHATTAN: Please, Laurie. Not yet. I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore. I'll be alone. You're the last human being I'll ever see.
