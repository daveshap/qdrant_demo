Question for Admissions Counselors
Currently work as an admissions counselor and I am unable to request off over 20 weeks of the year. While I expected there to be "black out" periods where I couldn't request off, is 20 weeks out of the year industry norm? On top of that during the black out periods we have extended hours and weekend work. We are not paid but rather given comp time, but are not allowed any comp time until the black out period is over.
