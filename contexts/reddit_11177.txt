My government is being a total dick :/
I just can't describe how bad I feel for living in this country anymore. It's getting more and more hellish every passing day.
Have you heared a country stuck between Europe and Middle East called Turkey?
Maybe you are familiar with Gezi Protests or June uprising last year.
Yes I was there. Tear gassed and water sprayed. I was beaten and taken into custody. I was abused and molested by the cops. It was both the best and worse times of my life.
Yeah that's where I am from. That's my own personal hell.
We recently had local elections. After 20 years of mayorship we wanted Ankara's (The capital) mayor to be gone. Just because he is a piece of shit. We voted. I waited infront of my ballot box just to make sure it's safe and no one does any monkey business. But guess what? Even though we know our candidate won, the election comitee announced the old mayor. We protested and  once again we were tear gassed and beaten. We demanded justice and once again we were teargassed. I don't know what to do anymore. 
I love this country because it's where I call home. But I can't live here. Not anymore. 
Fascism kills, man. Directly or indirectly. If the state violance won't kill me, I will end up killing myself.

Cheers to democracy we all fight for.
