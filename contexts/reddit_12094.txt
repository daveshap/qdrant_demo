My friend isn't being my friend
We've been friends for five years, five years of daily contact with nothing but happiness and good conversation. Then, communication stopped. (we moved away from our home town). I received a letter with nothing but positive things about our friendship and a section of encouragement "for rainy days." I know she cares about me, we've been through hell and high water together. We know everything about each other; yet she wont respond. We've accidentally met while visiting home, and its been jovial and pleasant. We sat and talked for 2 hours on two separate occasions. But she wont respond to emails, phone calls, or texts. One response I did happen to receive was that she wasn't purposely ignoring me, but the circumstances seem to say otherwise. I feel that ive lost my closest friend for no reason.
