Automotive accelerometer calibration I would like to design a device which measures acceleration, yaw, pitch and roll for motorsport/automotive application. I plan on using an analog accelerometer, to provide better bandwidth and low pass filtering control of the output voltage signals.Where I am somewhat confused, is how to account for the installed orientation of the device. I.e. if the device is installed such that a 1G acceleration in the X axis (with respect to the car) is measured as a combination of accelerations across multiple axes with respect to the accelerometer (e.g. 0.3G X, 0.4G Y), what methodology would I employ to 'calibrate' the accelerometer output to produce an accurate measurement?
