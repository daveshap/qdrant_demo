Valentine’s Day should also be a reminder of SELF-LOVE
It is usually a day during which we show love to someone else. But we need to also see it as a reminder to consistently show love to our own selves. Seeking help and focusing more on our victories (less on our shortcomings) are good starts. Your identity is not defined by your anxiety. You are MORE than that! Anxiety is not your final destination. So let’s stop beating ourselves up for yesterday! Love yourself more than you hate your circumstances ❤️
