BATEMAN: Carnes? Wait.
CARNES: Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
BATEMAN: What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
CARNES: Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
CARNES: Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
BATEMAN: Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
CARNES: Excuse me. I really must he going.
BATEMAN: No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
BATEMAN: Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
CARNES: But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
BATEMAN: It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
CARNES: It's just not.
BATEMAN: Why not, you stupid bastard?
CARNES: Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
BATEMAN: No, you...didn't?
CARNES: Now, if you'll excuse me.
PRICE: How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
VAN PATTEN: What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
PRICE: I don't believe it. He looks so...normal. He seems so... out of it. So...undangerous.
PRICE: I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
VAN PATTEN: Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
PRICE: And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
BATEMAN: I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
