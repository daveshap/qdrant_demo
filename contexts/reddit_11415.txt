I believe I'm too damaged to be in a relationship for long.
There's a lot to say here but I'll keep it short. Many of my past relationships have been painful. I've been cheated on, manipulated, used, people have tried to change who I am, verbally abused, constantly accused of cheating when I wasn't etc. Not all of my exes have behaved like this, to be clear. On top of mental health issues and being raised in a dysfunctional household, I feel I cannot trust a romantic partner. 
  I always think they're cheating, lying, doing something harmful to me, selling me out to my enemies or trying to manipulate me. Self loathing plays a role because I cannot find out why they're even talking to me in the first place. I know logically I have many desirable traits. I'm so misanthropic I find it unrealistic to think anyone has a real interest in me, instead of just a craving for my pain. 
  I believe if I cry in front of a partner for any reason at all; if I show a fleeting moment of uncertainty or pain; if I ever need one moment of support; if I make $5 per year less than them for even one moment then they will lose all respect, love and attraction to me. I was told this is incorrect. I cannot take that chance.
  I cannot trust or feel at ease in a relationship. I've tried to remain single, however I always fall for this trap. Either I drive them away by trying to catch them before they cheat, or it ends because I see their BS coming, or I find out too late that they're terrible.
  I feel terrible regret for the ones I've wrongfully accused of these things and a deepening hatred for the ones that made me think this is just what real life is. If I truly love you, whoever the next person will be to make the mistake of being drawn to me, I'll explain in the most loving way why I never want to talk to you again: whether correct or incorrect, I'll always think you're going to harm me and laugh about it. That is no way for either of us to live.
