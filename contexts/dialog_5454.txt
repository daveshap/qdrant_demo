SELINA: They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
MOM: I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
SELINA: Mom, not now! I, I don't know what to do..
MOM: Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
SELINA: But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
MOM: Do you always listen to what your mother says? Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you. Save the day..
SELINA: I don't know if I can do it alone.
MOM: Trust me, you won't have to.
