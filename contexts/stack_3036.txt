Supersymmetry: spin of the superpartners I'm currently working on my master thesis, and I need to know a bit of supersymmetry. I have been looking the theory and I have a basic knowledge about it.I have a problem with understanding the spin of the superpartners. When the multiplets are build, we have the operators which rise and lower the spin of the state by 1/2. Therefore the superpartners will have a spin which differs by 1/2 respect to the usual particle. But, why the squarks have spin 0 instead of 1? Quarks have spin 1/2, thus I understand that the superpartner should have either spin 0 or 1. But why 0 and not 1? This question applies of course to other particles, such as the photino(why not 3/2?), slepton(why not 1?), etc.Finally, we know that the gauge fields (graviton, photon, etc) are the connections for forces. Do the superpartners of the gauge fields play a role in the forces as well? I know that the gravitino can't, since there are not interacting theories of massless particles with spin greater than 2. What about the other gauge fields?
