Long distance is hard
I've been with her for about 2 years. It's a long distance relationship too, and we have yet to meet each other. And I want it to work out. But, it just seems like it won't. We've been fighting a lot recently. And we both decided it was because didn't Skype/facetime as much as last summer. Last summer we would be able to face time all night, and I really miss that. Now, the face times last 2 hours at most. I miss the time we would spend together. And I just feel like now I bother her if I want to spend more time face timing. It just fucking sucks and I hate it. And I feel so fucking clingy, I feel pathetic. I don't know, but it just sucks. 

Thanks for reading though guys!
