ROLAND: Cancel that, Dieter.
LUDLOW: What? Why?
ROLAND: Carnivores hunt near stream beds. Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
LUDLOW: You heard his, Dieter. Find a new spot. And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
ROLAND: Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions. First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is. Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day. Second condition -- my fee. You can keep it. All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs. A male. Buck only. Why and how are my business. If you don't like either of those conditions, you're on your own. Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care. But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas. Okay?
LUDLOW: Okay.
ROLAND: Good lad.
