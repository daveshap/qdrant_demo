I’m miserable at my first job after college. Should I stick it out for awhile or look for something else?
So I’ve been at the current company for less than a month. On the first day I just had this gut feeling that something wasn’t right. Communication seems to be an issue at the job. I wasn’t given any training on the different softwares the company uses or the role itself and on the first day I had to just dive into projects. My boss actually got really angry at me for not knowing as much. I suffered mild depression before and now I’m scared its going to make a come back. 

During meetings it’s like I just don’t exist, I’m a minority by the way. And I’ve been expected to work well over 10 hours. I feel like I don’t have enough knowledge to be tackling on projects so fast but I guess everyone feels that way with their first “real” job. I just feel like I’m failing right now and I’ve been thinking over is this career path really right for me.
