80's-90's short story: nothing rhymes with orange Growing up in the 80's and 90's, I read a sci-fi short story once about the human race being threatened by androids.The character in the story was talking to his friend about the androids, discussing possible ways to defeat them.  The boy says that when the androids encounter a problem they can't solve it blows their circuits, and suggested as an example the problem of finding a word that rhymes with \"orange.\"  As it turned out, the friend was an android and the problem blew his circuits.  I have looked but can't find the story.  If anyone here has an idea I'd love to know.
