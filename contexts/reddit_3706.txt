Stop fucking telling me to "lower my standards"
Like real shit stop telling me "oh youre aiming to high go lower"

&#x200B;

Honestly? No I will not lower my standards. I want be with the best possible partner and be happy and content with them instead of someone lower that im just "Ok with they'll do"

&#x200B;

I want me a woman that will treat me with geniune kindness and respect someone to chill and hang out with and will dominate me silly in the bedroom?

Is that aiming too high? Oh fucking well and if i dont get that. I'll be fine on my own because im not just gonna end up with someone that im not content with cuz my "standards are too high"
