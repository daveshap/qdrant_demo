I would rather do nothing at all times and choose it over going to work, hanging out with friends, and taking classes. Am I alone in this? How do I stop self sabotaging?

I have some sort of mental block around so many things. I just choose... not to do them. Even if they're things I really want to do or need to do.

For example, today I woke up and needed to be at work at 7. And I just chose not to go and went back to sleep. I just don't care about the consequences of things until it's too late. I've struggled with this for years and I don't know what to do about it. And I always quit before I can get fired, so I've had like 10 jobs in the last two years. I ask people to hold me accountable, I've tried working from home, in an office, in food service, it happens with hangouts with friends and writing classes I take... I just choose not to do things.

I have a lot of goals and dreams for myself. I want a lot for myself and I love to do a lot of things. But for some reason my love of doing nothing in the moment always overshadows my dreams. I literally envy people who break bones and stuff because they get to be bedridden for a month and have an excuse for just reading and watching TV and sleeping. I love sick days. I am constantly wishing I could just do nothing even though I feel good once I actually get out and accomplish things.

Does anyone else experience this? It makes me feel like I'm the biggest failure in the world.
