MELVIN: I'm hungry. You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
CAROL: What are you doing here?
MELVIN: This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
CAROL: Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
MELVIN: I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
CAROL: What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
MELVIN: Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
CAROL: My son is sick, okay?
MELVIN: What about your mother?
CAROL: How do you know about my mother?
MELVIN: I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
CAROL: Sorry, honey... I'll be right there.
MELVIN: How ya doing?
