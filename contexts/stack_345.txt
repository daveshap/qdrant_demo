Use iTunes credit to purchase items I have redeemed several hundred dollars of iTunes money to my Apple account. Is there any any app(s) in the store that allow you to pay for something (at a high price of course, due to Apple\u2019s fees) that can be shipped to your door (and potentially re-sold) with iTunes credit?Is this allowed in Apple\u2019s App Store Terms of Services, or are all In-App Purchases intended to cover some digital artefacts?If so, do apps allow you to buy currency which is in turn redeemable for something tangible or exchangeable?
