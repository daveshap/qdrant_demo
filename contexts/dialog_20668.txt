MICHAEL: But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
PEGGY: Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
MICHAEL: But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together. At least one more time.
PEGGY: That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
MICHAEL: You think so?
PEGGY: Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
MICHAEL: I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
PEGGY: It's Charlie!
MICHAEL: What a treat.
