PETRA: That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
XANDER: I'm from L.A.
PETRA: So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
XANDER: Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
PETRA: Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
XANDER: Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
PETRA: You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
XANDER: I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
PETRA: Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
XANDER: The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
PETRA: All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
XANDER: We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
PETRA: A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
XANDER: So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
