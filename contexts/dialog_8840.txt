DR. KLEIN: Do you keep any drugs in your house?
CHRIS: No. Of course not, nothing like that.
DR. KLEIN: Are you sure?
CHRIS: Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
DR. KLEIN: Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
CHRIS: No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
DR. KLEIN: I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
