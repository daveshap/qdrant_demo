Should developed nations like the US replace all poverty abatement programs with the guaranteed minimum income?
[Switzerland is gearing up to vote on the guaranteed minimum income,](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/magazine/switzerlands-proposal-to-pay-people-for-being-alive.html?pagewanted=2&_r=3&alg=3L4WL&pagewanted=all&) a bold proposal to pay each citizen a small income each month to keep them out of poverty, with very minimal requirements and no means testing.

In the US, similar proposals have been floated as an idea to replace the huge Federal bureaucracies supporting food, housing and medical assistance to the poor. The idea is that you replace all those programs in one fell swoop by just sending money to every adult in the country each month, which [some economists believe would be more efficient \(PDF\).](http://www.usbig.net/pdf/efficiencyargumentforbig.pdf)

It sounds somewhat crazy, but [a five-year experiment in the Canadian province of Manitoba showed promising results \(PDF\).](http://public.econ.duke.edu/~erw/197/forget-cea%20%282%29.pdf) Specifically, the disincentive to work was smaller than expected, while graduation rates went up and hospital visits went down.

Forgetting for a moment about any barriers to implementation, could it work here, there, anywhere? Is there evidence to support the soundness or folly of the idea?
