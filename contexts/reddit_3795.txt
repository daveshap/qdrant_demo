Loyalty during the “talking” phase.
*mostly for men* If you are “talking” to someone  NEVER be afraid to talk to other people too. At least before you both have become exclusive. You can be loyal all you want but nothing is stopping them from not following the same rules. In the end you don’t know what they do out of your view.
