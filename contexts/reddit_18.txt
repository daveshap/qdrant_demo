Why do I cry all the the time
Why do I cry all the the time

I’m crying almost every day since I remember. It can be caused by anything and often happens in public. It can be a bad mark, someone being mean or even someone raising their voice. Everyone thinks I’m weird because I cry so easily. I cried maybe 3 times watching movies, but when it comes to situations including me I’m in tears much more often. I can’t really control it. I also often cry at home usually because I’m overwhelmed by everything and I feel like I’m failing in every possible way. I had a few panic attacks in my life, but they don’t happen often. Are you able to help me somehow? I’m tired of being like this.

Sorry for bad English
