How Fast Life Passes
Hello, reddit! This is my first time posting. I know that this will probably be ignored or whatever, but, ehhh that’s alright. Anyway, What really bothers me is how fast life’s going. I mean, it seems like yesterday we were children, and now we’re young adults then pretty soon we’ll be in our thirties and then so on, and then we’ll die. I think this is the doing of my anxiety. (I have been clinically diagnosed with an anxiety disorder). If not, please tell me I’m not the only person who’s freaked out about this.
