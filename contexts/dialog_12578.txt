JULIE: Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
HIDER: Sure.
JULIE: Well, can I make an appointment?
HIDER: Maybe I could take a look at it now.
JULIE: Oh, great.
HIDER: Yeah, that was easy.
JULIE: Do you do washing machines, too?
HIDER: Just show me the way.
JULIE: Everything breaks at once.
HIDER: Isn't that always the way?
JULIE: So, you're just kind of a roving --
HIDER: -- General handyman, yeah. I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house. I do housesitting while the owners are away. In fact, that's why I've been in the area. I've been living very close by. Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
JULIE: Oh, that's fine.
