I want to die but afraid of dying!!!
Death. Death. Death. That is all I can think of right now. However, I am scared of dying. The thought of the hereafter scares me to death. What will happen to me after committing suicide? I keep asking myself this question whenever I think of suicide. I also ask myself these questions: how will my loved ones react to my death? What if in the final moments I regret my choice? Will it be painful? And finally: what awaits me after death?

As a religious person, it is not fun at all. Suffering in this world and the hereafter does not sound fair. I just want to end it all without burning in fire for eternity. But I am sure the fire will be my punishment if I were to commit suicide. But at the same time, I am suffering in this world. So really it all comes down to what is worse. I choose suffering here.

But at the same time not. I want to end it all. The shame, the struggle, the pain. Everything in this world I hate. There is nothing stopping me from ending my life other than the hellfire. Not even my loved ones. And I do not even feel selfish writing this. I am being honest.

Someday I am sure suicide will be my only option. Then the fear of hellfire will be gone. Even if it is not gone, I will be so lost and sad, losing my faith, and then I will commit suicide. I cannot wait for that day to come. I will then slice my throat open and, finally, put an end to all my suffering. Or, on the other hand, start a journey full of great suffering. As you can tell, I am contradicting myself all the time. That is because I am lost. And very sad. I want to die.
