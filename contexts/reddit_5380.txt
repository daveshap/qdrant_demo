How do you know if you’ve been put on a PIP?
I got promoted to assistant manager of a failing sales team at the end of last fiscal quarter.

Our district manager was supposed to train me, but for whatever reason he didn’t. So instead our general manager did, with the rationale being that the GM used to be a DM. Kinda weird but whatever.

Sales still suck, and the quarter is almost over.

So today my district manager came in and told me our sales are bad, and he gave me a chart to track my sales. He says he wants me to improve my sales by basically 10% in the next six weeks. He asked me what I think is keeping the team from higher sales, and we brainstormed some things to help raise sales.

He didn’t say what would happen if I don’t.

I’m kinda taken aback and unsure of how to interpret all of this. I barely even got promoted.

A lot of the powerful people in the company seem to like me (VPs, DMs, etc.)...except for the territory manager, who is just above district manager but below VP. The territory manager is friendly with me, but when I observe closely, I can tell something is off in how he reacts to my presence.

Our hierarchy is like: Founders>VPs>Territory Manager>District Managers>General Managers>Assistant Managers>Shift Managers
