What is the most politically favorable decision on Paris agreement?
The President is [still](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/868441116726710272) in a decision-making phase.

Before being elected he proposed to [renegotiate or even cancel](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-energy-idUSKCN0YH2D9) the agreement. We can't know what his decision will be without speculating too much. However, we can ask what decision is politically optimal? 

This question has 2 parts. First one is how wide is a space of decisions, whether it's completely binary (accept/not accept agreement) or there is a set of points in between?

And second part is what decision represents common ground between positions of his supporters and opponents? Of course, if it's possible to find some compromise at all. 

Full text of Paris agreement is accessible from [here](http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php). A summary is [here](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris_en#tab-0-0) (unfortunately, I haven't found one that is both clear and concise). 

EDIT: here are some graphs on public opinion: about [global warming](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/04/the-politics-of-climate/ps_2016-10-04_politics-of-climate_0-02/) and [paris agreement](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Politics-and-Global-Warming-November-2016-01.png)(86% of dems and 51% of reps support it). Latter results are surprising to me, but survey is quite representative (1000 respondents).
