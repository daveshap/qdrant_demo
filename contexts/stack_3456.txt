Can a security job be cracked without OSCP? I have my B.Tech in Information Technology with CEHv8 certification. I have 2 years of vulnerability assessment experience and 1.5 years of python automation experience. I am not able to crack any security job interviews.I mainly look forward for Application security but I had worked only for web application assessment and have experience on XSS, clickjacking, poodle, heartbleed and CSRF. I get rejected in penetration testing interviews because of lack of OSCP or mobile security testing experience.OSCP certification is bit costly for me and I am not sure how much time I can spent daily for it since I work for python automation right now.My plan was to get into a security role and then do OSCP, so that, I could spent time on it, I would be able to practice with experience as well as mainly I can reimburse the certification cost in the company.Are there any suggestions for me on how to achieve or proceed with my career dream? Is certification must or can I go with some other certification or something else? What effort do I need to put? I am well versed in Python.
