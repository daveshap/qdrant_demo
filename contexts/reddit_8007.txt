Fellow broke students!
Hey all, not strictly school related, but grad school is a struggle bus financially. my equally studious bf and I test drove Hyundai’s today and got 2 $50 gift cards. Their website has details, just enter info, get coupon, be kind and upfront about what you’re doing, and boom. Fun money. Or groceries. We’re buying food and a Switch game

EDIT: also! Friens! You can supposedly do it every 6 Months according to the fine print. So long as they’re running the promo still
