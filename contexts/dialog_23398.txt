JASON: I have been at the library.
MARY: But you're always at the library.
JASON: I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
MARY: I don't think that's so revealing.
JASON: But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
MARY: I don't know.
JASON: That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since."
MARY: I'm at sea, Jason.
JASON: Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
MARY: It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
JASON: I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
MARY: Devil worshippers!
JASON: Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
MARY: I can imagine.
JASON: Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
