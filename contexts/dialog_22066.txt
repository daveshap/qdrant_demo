ASHLEY: Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
RUDY: All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
ASHLEY: We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
RUDY: ...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
ASHLEY: Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
ASHLEY: You saved my life. You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
RUDY: You saved me.
ASHLEY: I saved you because I love you, Nick. Why'd you save me?
