No one gives a shit until you admit you want to die
Nobody gives a fuck how much pain you're in or how much you're suffering until you admit that you want to die. If you didn't give a fuck before don't pretend to now. Instead of locking me up like some kind of rabid animal just give me some sodium pentobarbital so I can fucking die.
