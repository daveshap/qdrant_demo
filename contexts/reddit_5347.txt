Opinions on/experiences with “no talking rule?”
Hey all,

So, I have 4 employees right now. Had 5, but one left already due to the employees having near-daily arguments.

I leave them alone for one minute and they start fighting. I don’t have the ability to constantly watch them, or anyone else I would trust to do so. 

We already had a two-hour long discussion on it, which helped for one day. Great waste of time when we’re already weeks behind schedule.

I’m at a loss. Tbh they’re from a temp agency and I’m pretty much done with them and the agency once I manage to hire more direct employees. They also seldom do a good job, deliberately choose to not follow directions (have a way they think is better), and they call in once a week. Right now I need the help though.

My Hail Mary is to meet with them again this morning and inform them if there’s one more fight, I’ll establish a “no talking rule.” 

Looked into the laws, I can do so as long as they’re allowed to talk during breaks.

I don’t want to, and pray I won’t have to. It’s almost barbaric. 

But I’m at a loss of any other solutions at this point.

I have 3 years management experience and have never had such a difficult staff. My boss is breathing down my neck about all these problems and I about walked out myself yesterday.

Anyone worked under this rule? Did it help or hurt employee arguments?
