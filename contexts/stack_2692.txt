Open Traverse Method for the map survey I need to use traverse method in my program on visual studio(WPF) so that the user can get their target point coordinate by using their initial data. In my knowledge there is two type of traverse that is open traverse and closed traverse. I search on the internet there mostly about the closed traverse. Although the open traverse cant be check for error i still need to use it for my project requirement. Can someone share me a simple open traverse calculation that i can use for my reference and program?
