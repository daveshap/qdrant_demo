First date tomorrow!
Lurker coming out of the shadows here! So I met a guy through an app last week and after a few days of chatting, he asked if we could meet up.

This world is so small, we actually have a mutual friend in common. Similar hobbies, similar lifestyles.

I'm liking where this is going, honestly. But if I'm honest, I'm in my late 20s and this is my first date ever.

I'm perfectly prepared to be myself. I'm really excited to get to know each other more. No crazy fantasies or expectations in my head (learned my lesson with that.)

Idk, I've just got pre-first-date jitters lol

**UPDATE:** Thank you, everyone, for your support and kind words! Date was GREAT â€” we learned a lot about each other.

Second date in the works :)
