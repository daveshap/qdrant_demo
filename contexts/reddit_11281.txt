I just don’t know what to do anymore, my life seems to be the same dreadful, boring day, everyday.
I’m 19 now and I’m just depressed as hell, I’ve never had a gf, I have no job, no car, barely any money, a family who always puts me down, etc. I’ve been wanting change but all I’ve got goin for me is community college, which I’m barely getting through. My mom says I’m not shit because I don’t pay bills and only spend my time studying and not out “doing shit”. 

Every time I wake up the same saying goes through my head, “today will be like yesterday and today will be like tomorrow”. I have no one to talk to about this and thought I’d give this place a shot, I’ve wanted so much more but never been able to achieve more. I’ve wanted my own place, a car, a gf most of all, etc. But I just can’t, I can’t get a job with no car or money, can’t get a place with no job, and can’t get a gf without any, I feel like my life is just an empty void, no ups, just small inconveniences that keep adding up. 

I’m ngl I used to consider suicide back in HS but now I just feel nothing, I get small joy from movies and games but that’s it, nothing else. I know it could be a lot worse, i could not be eating, not have a house, etc. But the lack of any real joy in my life keeps biting at me and I just wanted to put it out there as I have no friends willing to hear this kind of stuff out.

TLDR; I’m depressed, my life has seen few joys and I just don’t know what I can do to improve it in the slightest.
