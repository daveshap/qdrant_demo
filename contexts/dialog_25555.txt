LUKE: Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
THREEPIO: I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
LUKE: That's all right. There is nothing anyone can do about it. You can call me Luke.
THREEPIO: Thank you, sir. I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
LUKE: There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
THREEPIO: Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
LUKE: You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
THREEPIO: That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
LUKE: Tell me where you've been. I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars. My father was a Jedi! Were you in many battles?
THREEPIO: Several, I think. There is not much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
