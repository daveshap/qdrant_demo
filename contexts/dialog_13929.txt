CLAUDIA: I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
LOUIS: What danger?
CLAUDIA: I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
LOUIS: Do you think I would let them harm you?
CLAUDIA: No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
LOUIS: Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
CLAUDIA: Love?
CLAUDIA: You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
LOUIS: Never.
CLAUDIA: He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
LOUIS: That's not so.
CLAUDIA: Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
LOUIS: So you felt it too!
CLAUDIA: Let him go, he said. Let him go.
