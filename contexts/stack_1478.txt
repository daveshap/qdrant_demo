Minimum voltage of 18650 I have made a rechargeable torch using 4 LEDs in parralel and an 18650 battery. The battery is charged by using a TP4056 module. Due to the fact that I got 10 for 1 pound on ebay it does not have over discharge protection. What is the minimum voltage I can take the battery to. As the 4 LEDs wired in parallel are connected to a 100 ohm resistor will the LEDS switch off when the voltage is too low ?
