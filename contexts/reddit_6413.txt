Why do people write so much about this topic? Isn't it like educating the masses to wear a black belt with black pants? Shouldn't everyone know this already?!

Surprisingly, people write about this because candidates still make rookie mistakes in interviews. From my own experience, I interviewed three people in the last four weeks, and I heard and saw some crazy things. Interviews can be intense, so let's go over a few Do's and Don'ts:

**INTRODUCTIONS**

Do: Stand up, make eye contact, and shake their hand firmly
Don't: Shake their hand while sitting down

This is kind of the ABCs of introductions, but it is surprising how many people do not shake hands and do not rise when introduced to you. Whenever I am introduced to someone new, whether they are below me in position or above, I always make sure to stand up. Maybe it is something that the military taught me, but it is a sign of respect. Doing so will show that you respect the person, and they tend to remember you better. Also, give a firm handshake. You are not trying to break the person's fingers, but the worst handshakes are like holding a dead fish.

**RESUME**

Do: Bring along a copy of your resume in case
Don't: Bring in a different resume than the one you submitted

I had a candidate bring in their resume, which was drastically different than the one I had previously read. It had much more detail than the one I had been given, and given that I had a limited amount of time with him, I didn't have time to read it. It was a waste of effort on his part. As an interviewer, it made me think that he hadn't prepared properly when submitting his application in the first place, and the drastic difference in content made me wonder if he had embellished the new copy. Most interviewers will not take the time to read a new resume during your interview, so do not bother. They will be more focused on hearing you speak than reading.

If you really have no idea which resume you sent them, then bring in your most updated resume and only offer it if they do not already have a copy handy. Most interviewers will have your resume with them when they enter the room.

**ENERGY**

Do: Show a lot of energy and passion about what you are applying for
Don't: Show too much energy or negative energy about where you are trying to leave

As an interviewer for my team, I am looking for someone that will bring passion and energy to the position I am offering. This would apply to a data entry person, all the way to an electrician. Everyone wants to hire someone that shows passion for what they do and that will want to come in to work everyday. And hopefully by sharing your energy, you will make them WANT to have you there everyday.

If a candidate is very quiet and doesn't smile, I tend to wonder if they even want the position I am offering. I will try to smile back at them or will raise my energy in an attempt to draw out their more excited side. If your energy is too low, I will also ask the question, "What kind of energy will you bring to the team?" Some people have caught onto this and will show more excitement, but others have answered this in a monotone voice, and that is when I know that I have the wrong person.

**ANSWERING QUESTIONS**

Do: Give a thorough and precise answer
Don't: Spend 10-15 minutes doing so for each question

I try to give every person at least 60 minutes for an interview, so that I have time to feel them out and answer any of their questions; unfortunately, I have more recently been limited to 30 minutes. That is a very short time in Interview Land. When a question is asked, answer the question thoroughly with details, but keep your answers short. This can be hard, because you want to share all of your knowledge, but the worst thing you could do is drone on and on. I recently had an interview where the candidate kept talking for 15 minutes straight, and it was to the point that I couldn't remember the question I asked. And at the end, she couldn't either!

If you find yourself forgetting the original question, you have gone too far. Instead, if your answer is multifaceted, give the high-level answer and then offer to provide details if they would like more information. As an example, if someone asked me how to make a Peanut Butter & Jelly sandwich, I would advice them that I would prepare my work area, collect the ingredients needed, make my sandwich, clean my tools, and then put my sandwich on a plate for consumption. I would then offer to give more detail if they wanted more than this.

**ASKING QUESTIONS**

Do: Prepare a list of questions
Don't: Turn the tables on your interviewer

Always prepare a list of questions to ask during interviews. It shows the interviewer that you are curious about working there and that you invested time in your potential future there. Sometimes I had inadvertently answered the candidate's questions before they have a chance--and that's ok. When you are asked if you have any questions, say something to the effect of, "I had a list of questions, but you answered my question regarding X, Y, and Z already."

When I say "Don't turn the tables on your interviewer," I mean that you shouldn't ask questions of your interviewer that they may ask you. For example, I interviewed someone in the past that wanted to know about what I did at the job, what I liked and didn't like, and what my 5 year goals were. These are interesting questions, and I didn't mind answering them, but it changed the mood of the interview so that we left on an awkward foot. If the hiring manager will be your direct manager, you can ask them what their expectations are, or perhaps what would prevent you from getting the position, but keep it at surface level questions (expectations, pay/benefits, hours of operations, etc). A fun question I like to be asked is what a typical day looks like.

For my nervous friends...

If you tend to get nervous and forget things, as some people do (myself included sometimes), write down your questions or any ideas that you want to make sure you hit. This again shows that you are prepared and spent time doing so, and it will help to jog your memory when your adrenaline is racing.
