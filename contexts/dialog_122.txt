COLUMBUS: Can't you stay with us a little?
BEATRIX: I am busy inside.
BEATRIX: What is it, now? Tell me...
COLUMBUS: I can't keep my eyes off you. I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
COLUMBUS: What are you listening to?
FERNANDO: I am not listening, Father. But I can't help hearing.
