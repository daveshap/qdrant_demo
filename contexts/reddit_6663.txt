Someone help me speak the language of Recruiter
Been job searching for the past few months. After being unemployed since last October, and a concurrent part-time MBA student, I decided to switch to a full-time MBA schedule beginning in November of last year, and graduated 2 weeks ago. I've had some "luck" getting interviews, but have yet to receive any offers. One thing in particular that I am struggling with is the roller coaster ride of recruiter communications. Let me give you an example from this week.   


I'd gone through two separate rounds of interviews for two jobs last week. I thought both went well. As of Wednesday of this week, I had not yet heard anything regarding my status as a candidate. I decided to send a quick, friendly follow-up email to both of the internal recruiters from each company to inquire about my status as a candidate. Almost immediately after sending, I got a response from one of the recruiters saying something along the lines of, "We must be telepathic, because I was just going to email you. We want to bring you to 2nd round of interviews. I'll be following up later today with more information. Look for an email later this afternoon asking for your schedule." Been 2 days since this email and there's been no follow-up. How am I supposed to translate this?   


As for the other recruiter, haven't heard a peep. Been driving me bananas. This is not the first experience I've had with recruiters where communication seems a bit "off" and I'm sure it won't be my last. But I don't feel like I've quite yet learned how to translate what it means.
