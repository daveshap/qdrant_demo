EVAN: Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
TOMMY: I think I'll go check out the chapel.
ANDREA: You're. Acting. Like your father.
EVAN: Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
ANDREA: How. Did you. Know that?
EVAN: You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
ANDREA: Just. Like. Jason.
EVAN: Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
