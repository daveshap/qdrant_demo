Guiding undergraduate students who are interested in student affairs
Greetings! I am a Graduate Assistant who has been tasked with creating a student organization for undergraduate students who are interested in pursuing a career in Student Affairs. This organization does not currently exist so I will be building it from the ground up. I was hoping there might be someone on this sub who has some kind of experience with something like this. I really haven't decided what the structure of the group would like but I do know that I want us to discuss the different options under Student Affairs and set up systems that will help seniors with their job search/set them up with mentors. If anyone has any thoughts/tips/advice, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
