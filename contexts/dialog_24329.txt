APRIL: Will that be cash or charge?
PAUL: Better make it charge.
APRIL: I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
PAUL: I confess.
APRIL: I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
RASHID: It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
APRIL: Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
PAUL: Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
RASHID: Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
APRIL: What!
RASHID: Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
APRIL: No! At least I don't think I am!
RASHID: Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
APRIL: An invitation?
RASHID: Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us. Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
PAUL: Absolutely. We would be honored.
APRIL: And what's the occasion of this celebration?
RASHID: It's my birthday.
APRIL: And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
RASHID: I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday. The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
APRIL: Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
RASHID: Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
APRIL: And what are you, his chaperone?
RASHID: Actually, I'm his father.
