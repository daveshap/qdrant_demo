MARY: Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
HEALY: Same here again.
MARY: By the way, what's your name?
HEALY: Pat Healy.
MARY: Don't you want to know my name?
HEALY: I already know it, Mary.
MARY: How'd you know that?
HEALY: It's right there on your golf bag.
MARY: What are you doing with all these blueprints?
HEALY: Some buildings I'm working on.
MARY: Are you... an architect?
HEALY: Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
HEALY: I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
MARY: What's that?
HEALY: I work with retards.
MARY: I beg your pardon?
HEALY: You know... ...the guys who ride the short bus.
MARY: Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
HEALY: The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
MARY: No, I mean
HEALY: -- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
MARY: -- He's in a cage?!
HEALY: Well it's more of an enclosure really.
MARY: They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
HEALY: That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
MARY: That sounds like fun.
HEALY: Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me. Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world. Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
MARY: Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER: Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
TED: What?
BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER: You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
TED: I'll try to be more careful.
BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER: S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
TED: The thing's kind of heavy.
BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER: Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
TED: No, I just meant...
BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER: Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee.
