Why Iâ€™m I being ghosted?
I like a guy who gives me the weirdest signs. Here is the list of things he did: he opened up about his past when we barely talked to each other, texted me sweet dreams, asked me about my type, thought that I was into other guys, came up to my desk each day to greet me, looked into my eyes each time I spoke and spread his legs when facing me, his friend bobbing his head my direction leaving him smiling and shaking his head, then ghosted me and only said hey, until winter break and HUGGED ME And wished me a Merry Christmas, then back to being ghosted, sitting next to this really funny kid and my crush would look my way ever so often but still being ghosted atm. HELP ME DOES HE LIKE ME OR NOT??
