TIM: Happy fuckin' Halloween.
BETH: Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
HARRY SIMMS: So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me. Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
JAMIE: No, please listen! They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
HARRY SIMMS: Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
JAMIE: It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
