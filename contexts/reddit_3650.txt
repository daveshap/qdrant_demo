I need cuddles
***IDK if this is allowed to be here but it is***

It's really annoying to want/need someone in the sense of physical affections because I need them meaning I don't have them right now. I really want my boyfriend rn like I need cuddles and I'm probably gonna get emotionally affected by not being able to cuddle them but I can't really do much yet cuz I don't have a lot of control over my life. so yeah I need cuddles 

Cuddles are nice
