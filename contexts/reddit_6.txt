How to tell my parents I want to get medical advice on my mental health
I'm using my alt for this because I don't really want my friends seeing this post. I'm a 15 yr old male and I think I may be suffering from anxiety, I don't want to be one of those kids who says they have some metal health disorder for attention but doing my own research I do seem to have some of the conditions associated with this. I've never told anyone this as I've never been very good talking about how I feel. I've been struggling wether to bring this to my parents or not. I feel nervous going to them about it because it feels stupid. Its not that I want a diagnoses I just want to clear things up for my own head. Idk this might be a normal thing and maybe I'm overreacting. I just want a second opinion from an unbiased point of view. Thanks in advance and I'll try give more detail if you want me to.
