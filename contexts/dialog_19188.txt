MICKEY: That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
WAYNE: On average forty million.
MICKEY: 'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
WAYNE: Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
MICKEY: 'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...
MICKEY: ...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
WAYNE: Yes.
MICKEY: Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
WAYNE: Got it.
