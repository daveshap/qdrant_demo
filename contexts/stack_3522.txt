is every site without a CSRF token vulnerable to CSRF attack? I found a lot of popular sites not having crsf token in cookie header, does that mean all of these sites are vulnerable? I tried to learn more about it and found there's something called CORS which protects it but I can't understand what is it. Please share your methodology if possible, like what will you test for if you don't find a site with crsf token? how will you check if it has one or not?
