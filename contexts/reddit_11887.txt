I'm scared that torrenting has caught up to me.
I used to torrent games like demos. I would download the game, try it, and if I really liked it, I'd buy the game. If I didn't like it, I'd uninstall it and move on. 

I downloaded a game about a month ago, and played it. I didn't like it, but I forgot to delete it, and it was still seeding, and sitting on my computer. 

I left home about a week and a half ago on a road trip, and apparently, yesterday, my dad was called by Penn and Teller Data, and they shut my Internet down for twenty four hours. I'm not home. I'm scared. I had my brother uninstall uTorrent and all things off of all the computers in the house, but I'm still very very scared that something is going to happen, and I'm not there to do anything about it. Someone please either ease my mind, or tell me I'm fucked, because I'm so scared.
