SAUNDRA: I'm talking to you asshole !
MATTHEW: Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
BRUCE: Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ?
MATTHEW: Because of my charming personality ?
SAUNDRA: Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
BRUCE: Why should I ?
SAUNDRA: You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
BRUCE: You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
SAUNDRA: Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
BRUCE: Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
SAUNDRA: I'm not fucking him..
MATTHEW: You don't have to sound so emphatic.
SAUNDRA: We just having our first date when you showed up.
