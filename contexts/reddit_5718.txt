What am I doing wrong?
Hey all,

Recently I moved from a rural area to a metropolitan and I'm struggling to find employment. I've gone online and filled out at least 100 applications, and tried to go through temp agencies, all to no avail. Generally with these applications I include a simple but definitive resume along with a note saying I'm looking for immediate employment. I've had two interviews, one for a pyramid scheme and another that told me I wasn't exactly what they were looking for. I moved to this area because of some health issues along with divorcing. What am I doing wrong and what can I do to fix it?
