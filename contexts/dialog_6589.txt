MRS. MAYER: I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
LETTY: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
MRS. MAYER: Oh, Letty, what happened?
LETTY: Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
MRS. MAYER: I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
LETTY: I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
MRS. MAYER: Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
LETTY: I just want to go home. Can we go home now?
LETTY: Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
MRS. MAYER: We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
MRS. MAYER: Yes.
LETTY: But what about Beast? Who'll...?
MRS. MAYER: Ruth's already taken him home.
LETTY: And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
MRS. MAYER: Paul said he'd call the school. And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
