MAC: Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
BABE: It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
MAC: Did it?
BABE: I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
MAC: Is he really that big a sap?
BABE: He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
MAC: Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
BABE: If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
MAC: How'd you get the picture?
BABE: Had the boys follow us.
MAC: Marvelous! At two o'clock this morning
BABE: I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
MAC: When're you going to see him again?
BABE: Tonight, maybe. I'll phone him at noon. Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
MAC: You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
BABE: I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
MAC: Good! Good! Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy. Babe, I could kiss you!
BABE: Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
MAC: Sure.
BABE: With pay! She is out the door.
MAC: You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
WALTER: Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
LONGFELLOW: You're Walter, aren't you?
WALTER: Yes, sir.
LONGFELLOW: I just wanted to make sure.
