NEIL: Charlie, That was great! Where did you learn to play like that?
CHARLIE: My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it. The sax is more sonorous.
KNOX: God, I can't take it anymore! If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
CHARLIE: Knox, you gotta calm down.
KNOX: No, I've been calm all my life! If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
NEIL: Where are you going?
KNOX: I'm calling her!
