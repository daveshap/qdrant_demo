DARLENE: Story of my life. Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
LONG: Oh, no?
DARLENE: Oh, you're two of a kind, doc. Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
DARLENE: ...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
DARLENE: ...he's smart enough to get you...
DARLENE: ...somehow.
DARLENE: There's something else too.
LONG: Uh, we both like to fish.
DARLENE: Secrets.

DARLENE: And you ain't gonna start now.
