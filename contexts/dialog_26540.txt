SUPERMAN: You! The girl from the volcano! Kryptonite...
EVE: Help! I mean -- I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it - There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
SUPERMAN: What are you doing here?
EVE: Screaming
SUPERMAN: Besides that.
EVE: He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
SUPERMAN: The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?
EVE: The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
SUPERMAN: I'd better get you down.
EVE: Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
SUPERMAN: Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
EVE: Oh.
SUPERMAN: Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
EVE: What can I tell you? He's my leader.
SUPERMAN: Okay. Take me to your leader.
