COX: Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
DEANE: He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
COX: Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter? I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
DEANE: You already have staked your reputation. Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too. Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose. The fail-safe onâ€”line, yet?
