I keep being used as a middle-person for my roommate and our guy friends.
So it's the beginning of our second year in college and it's been going fairly well. Except for the fact that people keep trying to talk to my roommate through me, instead of, you know, texting me to talk to me. Maybe it's a little petty and maybe I should just get over it, but it kinda bothers me that several guys have been using me as a middle-person. 

I suppose it makes me feel pretty insignificant. Especially one of these friends, was a good friend of mine in the first place, and then I introduced him and my roommate. Maybe I'm jealous, and I suppose that means I'm a bit insecure, doesn't it? I know I should chill and let things be as they are, but I can't help feel like I'm turning into the second-hand friend.
