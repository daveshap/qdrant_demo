TRINITY: Don't be ridiculous.
CYPHER: We're going to kill him. Do you understand that? He's going to die just like the others.
TRINITY: Morpheus believes he is the One.
CYPHER: Do you?
TRINITY: I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
CYPHER: You don't, do you?
TRINITY: If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
CYPHER: I intend to, believe me. Someone has to.
TRINITY: Did you hear that?
CYPHER: Hear what?
TRINITY: Are you sure this line is clean?
CYPHER: Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
