Don't invest in someone based off of how much you like them. Invest in them based off of how much they invest in YOU.
Don't let your investment into someone become a reflection of how much you like them; let how much someone is invested in you become a reflection of how much you should invest into them.

Edit: I'm seeing some people take this out of context so let me explain. I'm not saying to just sit back and let the other person do all the work. Of course sometimes you have to take the risk to invest into someone to see if something will pan out or not. But if you are starting to show interest into someone and they aren't reciprocating the same level of investment as you big or small, move on. They don't deserve YOU. 

Know what your core needs are. Know your standards.
