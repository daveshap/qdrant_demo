Got a call from a company I applied for but there's a small problem
Hello everyone, I hope you're doing okay!

I'm in a rather uncomfortable situation. But let me start by giving some background info!

A month ago, I was working and one of the customers I got to talk to is in a very good position in another bigger company. So I asked him if they were hiring. He immediately gave me his email adress and told me to send him my CV. Did that during my break and got no reply. 

Didn't get my hopes up since that company usually hires people who are really close to each other (x's son, x's brother, etc). In other words, it's kinda difficult to get in, but they are building a new plant nearby so I took a chance.


The main thing here is, the day before yesterday I was working (we cannot carry our mobile phones with us, safety measures and bla bla bla). So I take my break, check my phone, and see a missed call from a number I don't know. I googled it, and the name of such company appears everywhere. 


What I did was call them but no one answers, it doesn't even give me the option to leave a message.
In my country we have a long holiday period starting from yesterday to next Monday... so I was wondering if I should call them again and try my luck or wait it out until Monday and see if I get a call.

What do you think about this situation? Could it be possible it's them? There wouldn't be any other reason to call me than to at leeeeast try to hire me?

I'm kinda confused but anxious at the same time because it would be a very good job offer.

Also, the phone number IS the one from the company. Double,triple and quadruple checked....heh.

Any advice? I want to stay positive

Thank you!
