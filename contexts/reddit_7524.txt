One of my student’s final exam has a missing page.
Hey guys,

I teach an introductory chemistry lab. I noticed while grading the final exams that one of the students has a missing last page, which could be due to errors in stapling the pages or something. What’s the best course to navigate this? Should I email her so that she could fill out the last page? Or should I just give her the points as if she took it?

I got half the mind of just giving her the points since (1) she wasn’t doing very well anyway and (2) I’m graduating, and will be leaving the school in a few weeks time.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
