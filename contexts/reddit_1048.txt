Does anyone get the feeling that you're supposed to be worrying about something but you just can't figure out what it is?
Like, right now I feel like there's something I should be worrying about and it's killing me, it's driving me nuts, and it's keeping me on edge because I don't know what it is and I honestly just want to flip every table I see.

This happens like ALL THE TIME and sometimes I hope my brain is just normal.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the replies! It made me realize that I'm not alone and that there are other people who experience the same thing I'm experiencing right now and it made my day, thank you!

I hope you all have a good day!
