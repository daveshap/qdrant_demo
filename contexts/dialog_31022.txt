TED: I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books. Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
UNCLE BILLY: You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
TED: Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
UNCLE BILLY: You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
TED: James, what are you doing here?
JIMMY: You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
TED: Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
JIMMY: She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
TED: It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
