How to tell if a company is a sinking ship and when to jump?
My current company was purchased by a much larger company a year or so ago. Financially, we haven’t performed as the new owners would have liked and they are starting to make changes at the top of the tree. There currently isn’t any talk of serious cuts to people numbers but I’m wondering if it is time for me to move before it happens. Has anyone been through this sort of process? What were the warning signs before things got bad? Did you leave at the right time and when was it?
