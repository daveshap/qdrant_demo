Finally caught up on bills and still have money in the bank
I got paid today and yesterday I had less than $2 in my bank account. While drinking my morning coffee, I checked my account and immediately paid off my loan payment, my sonâ€™s cell phone, my utilities bill, sent my BF money I owed him, and set aside money for rent (going to pay it today). 

It doesnâ€™t sound like a lot, but going from almost completely broke after the holidays to having a few hundred bucks banked is giving me a huge feeling of triumph. Even 6 months ago, I was so poor I couldnâ€™t eat regularly and was always behind on things. Debt consolidation was the best thing I ever did, but it has still been a struggle. Through budgeting and learning to control my impulsive shopping habits, Iâ€™ve turned my life around. 

My goals for 2019:
-stick to my budget
-aggressively pay down my debt (I owe about $3k in debt consolidation)
-save for a new apartment 

It should be noted that I only make Ontario minimum wage, but I have an interview on Monday for a new job which will pay me at least $10k more a year (for a starting wage) that I think I am gonna get. If I get this new job, itâ€™s gonna make achieving my goals so much easier. 

Donâ€™t lose hope, my friends! Have a plan in place, and try to stick to your guns ðŸ’ª
