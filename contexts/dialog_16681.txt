QUINCY: You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
MONICA: Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
QUINCY: Nah. I have curfew.
QUINCY: What are you doing here?
ZEKE: Your door was unlocked.
QUINCY: Still is, so let yourself out.
ZEKE: We need to talk.
QUINCY: We ain't got nothing to talk about.
ZEKE: I messed up, okay, I know that. But I ain't that kid's father.
QUINCY: Lucky kid.
ZEKE: Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
QUINCY: And some things should never fucking happen!
ZEKE: Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
QUINCY: I ain't a damn liar.
ZEKE: Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
QUINCY: So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
ZEKE: I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man. But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel. And another twenty that made it past security on your floor. And the boldest one is standing right at your door. And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game. I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have. But I did it cause I love you.
QUINCY: Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you. I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
ZEKE: What?
QUINCY: From your mouth.
ZEKE: I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
QUINCY: Always thought can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary."
