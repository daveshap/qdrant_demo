Anyone have resources for free historical/diversity themed coloring sheets?
Hey there. I find that coloring things in de-stresses people a bit. 

Do any of you have links/resources for free coloring book pages that depict historical figures/diversity related figures that could be colored in? Was looking to use some for a program.

If any of you have other ideas for more passive, calming/stress-relieving programs, let me know.
