Hoarding books/ebooks because you want to learn, and then not reading them because you're too anxious about not being able to absorb what's in them
Anybody else suffer with this? It's a combination of a spending problem (the acts of purchasing the books) and a reading-anxiety problem (with not being able to follow along with a book's text)
