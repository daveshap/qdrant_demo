LUKE: ... I told you, I'm not hungry.
CREATURE: Patience. It's time to eat.
LUKE: Look, it smells good. I'm sure it's delicious But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
CREATURE: It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
LUKE: Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
CREATURE: Not far, not far. Be patient. Soon you will see him. Why wish you become a Jedi?
LUKE: Because of my father, I guess.
CREATURE: Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
LUKE: How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. Can't we get on with this already?
