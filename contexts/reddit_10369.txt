Suicide is a solution to a permanent problem
I’ll always be alone no matter what I try to do. Rejection hurts far too much and I’d rather be dead then have to experience it hundreds of times over and over again. I’d rather die than have to live life forever alone. I don’t give a shit if I’m young. I’d rather live a short life than live a long life of pain, misery and loneliness that only ends when I die of old age. I regret choosing not to kill myself in high school. The pain only persists and gets worse
