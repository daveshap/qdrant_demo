For how smart some of you guys are, I’m also surprised how so many of you lack common sense
this may be an unpopular opinion: but you CANNOT double enroll or pay the deposits at 2+ colleges to secure your spot. I have seen 16383993 posts the last few days of you guys saying you want to double enroll. No, you cannot do that. When you fill out the common app, YOU AGREE TO ONLY ENROLL AT ONE SCHOOL. Not to mention, securing multiple spots is a waste of money, and quite frankly—disrespectful to the school. If you are smart enough to get into a top 20, than you should be smart enough to comprehend this. If you cannot understand this, (which many of you can’t) I think you either lack common sense, or you need to make up your darn mind. You had plenty of time to make up your mind, but you have not. Everyone else is in the same exact boat as you, you aren’t special. If I see another one of these posts I might tear all my hair out. If you are enrolling at more than one school I hope you get rescinded :) peace out
