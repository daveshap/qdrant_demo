Compare hazard ratios in case-control setup quick disclaimer: first time poster; i have searched through the forums extensively but please bear with me if this is a silly question or point me towards the solution if it has been answered before.anyways, I have received two datasets:A contains a number of cases, i.e. affected by a disease. B contains 4 times as many controls. they are similar in age and sex. outcome and covariates are identically recorded in the two datasets.i have then constructed two separate cox-ph models with the same dichotomized covariate and it appears that this covariate is protective, i.e. HR 0.8, in the one group and a borderline-harmful, i.e. HR ~1.02, in the other. both results have very narrow 95% CIs and are (highly) significant owing to the large sample size in both groups.is there a valid way to compare these HRs and obtain a p-value for such testing? I have seen simple comparisons with x\u00b2 in (high ranking) journals, but surely that can't be appropriate.thank you!
