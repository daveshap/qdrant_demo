Even making art, I feel empty.
Fairly certain I've just been in a depressive slump for some weeks now. When I can be bothered to feel anything, about all I can manage is anger or anxiety, but it's mostly this generally unpleasant sense of self loathing.

"So why not pursue one of your creative outlets? Draw some stuff? Knit? Do a cross-stitch? Get some of those bad feelings out in a productive way?" My friends have said, in an attempt to help me with something that I'm perfectly aware they can't really help me with. 

I find it difficult to care enough to bother, but even when I make myself finish something, I don't feel any sense of accomplishment. I am just as disgusted with myself as I was before (despite arguably being more productive than I normally am in the evenings, which intellectually seems like it really *ought* to count for something) and now there's some new dumb piece of shit PSD file on my hard drive or my ugly wool rectangle is a few rows longer. 

I'm even *fairly* technically competent at drawing, but everything I create just seems so void of anything worthwhile. Inexplicable anger, sadness, and/or apathy seem like the kinds of subjects that could make for interesting art pieces, but I just *don't fucking care*.

I remember when this used to be so enthralling that I'd spend 7 hours drawing or making pictures with thread, until I'd realize it was 2 in the morning and I needed to go to sleep. Now everything seems like a tedious waste of time, though I struggle to think of anything I'd rather be doing.

Nothing else seems even vaguely engaging, either, which is kind of frustrating. Not my friends, my karate class, my supposedly favorite shows that my friends all keep up with (and who will wonder why I'm not caught up), or my little warm dog. Fuck, this shit is making me *boring*.
