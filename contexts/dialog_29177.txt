CHARLIE: I beg your pardon.
MAVERICK: No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
CHARLIE: Why not?
MAVERICK: I saw one.
CHARLIE: You saw a MiG 21?
MAVERICK: I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
CHARLIE: Where did you see that?
MAVERICK: It's classified.
CHARLIE: It's what?
MAVERICK: It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
