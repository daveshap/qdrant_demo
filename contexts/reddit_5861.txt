Should I leave my current job and pursue master's abroad in hopes of getting a better job or stay home, gain experience and get my master's here?
Hi guys,  
 I'm facing a tough decision and would really appreciate some advice. So I'm from a small eastern European country, living standards aren't that great and there aren't many options for master's either. I graduated from university last year and got a good job in my field of work. I really like my job, but was thinking of getting my master's to have a better chance of getting a higher paying job. In my opinion, my language skills and academic background allows me to study abroad and then return home. At the same time, i'm not stressed at this job at all and it allows me to gain some valuable experience. This question feels more like education vs experience. So what do you think guys? should I continue working and get to higher positions by adding experience to my resume or get my master's abroad, which will also be valuable in the  recruiters' eyes.

Edit: Should have mentioned, I majored in International Relations.
