Why I deleted Tinder
Some days ago I decided to delete tinder, Ive deleted it plenty of times but this time I hope it's for good. I am still single. This is partially because of me not feeling so good at the moment and having a hard time rejecting people if we dont click. Which leads to me being only half as honest I would like to be with people. And thats important!

But also because of the feeling that dating on tinder feels forced and unnatural. As in not a normal situation to actually meet a partner for the first time. I know lots of people meet eachother online and it probably is a good method, but not for everyone. I went on 5 dates thanks to tinder and I've felt that most of them does'nt seem genuine. It feels like people go on dates just because everyone else is doing it. You ask eachother about work and family and try to decide if they would be a good partner in under a few hours. 

Instead of that I would like to become friends first but that feels difficult on an app such as tinder. I believe meeting friends of friends is a safer bet when wanting to meet someone and getting to know them in a non-forced setting. Sure there are other dating apps, but it's still a strange first encounter for a potential partner, for me at least.

Atm I will focus on being with friends and family, studying and maybe in a while someone interesting will pop up:)  Also, sorry for the rant. It would be interesting to know if anyone else feel the same!

TL;DR - Don't date just because everyone else is doing it, do it because you want to and do it after you feel like you can handle being straight with people. Also, dating feels forced.
