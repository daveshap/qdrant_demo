LOOSELEAF: Go to the funeral?
HAROLD: Of course! Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform! Rent a uniform!
LOOSELEAF: That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
HAROLD: Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
LOOSELEAF: Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
HAROLD: When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos. I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear. To our women.
LOOSELEAF: I didn't know we had any women left.
HAROLD: The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
LOOSELEAF: Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
