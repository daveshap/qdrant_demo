Is anyone else annoyed by 'recruiters' that don't know where you live?
I am a job seeker in the Cybersecurity area. I live outside the 5th largest US city, but close enough that the downtown area is an easy commute. (Okay, 'easy' may not be right, but did it for 10 years.) When I post my resume on job sites (Indeed, Dice, Monster...etc) I use my home postal code, and set the search parameters for around 25 miles.

Why oh why do I get recruiters asking me if I want to apply for a job ON THE WEST COAST!? I live outside of Philadelphia. I don't want to relocate, I make sure the little box is checked 'No'. For the love of all that is holy, look at where the job is and where I am. I don't need to 

I had a recruiter get mad at me yesterday. He wanted me to apply for a job in Northern New Jersey. This is a 2 1/2 one way drive. I said I'd apply, but wouldn't even think about it for less than $90/hr on W2. He told me to stop wasting his time. HE FREAKING CALLED ME!  Here is what is in my recent trash since April 29th:
