I accrue 3.34 leave hours per every two weeks. I am also a diabetic and have more than one doctor I have to see in order to keep all of my prescriptions. Doctors dont work outside of 9-5 hours. So when I want to go see my sister get married, I get threatened with termination.
They dont allow us to take LWOP unless it's an emergency.. as in hospitilization or death in the family.

I'm so angry right now I'm holding back fury tears!
