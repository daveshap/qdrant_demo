GUY: Don't you work with Ian?
WILSON: Ian?
GUY: I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
WILSON: Sorry. Wasn't me.
GUY: You sure?
WILSON: Unless I'm not who I think I am.
GUY: That's too bad. Ian's got a good thing going over there.
WILSON: Yeah?
GUY: Turned that place completely around. 180 degrees.
WILSON: No kidding.
GUY: What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
WILSON: Right. Chain of respect. That's good, that.
GUY: Yeah. I really admire the guy. Well. Good to meet you.
WILSON: Yeah. Cheers, mate.
