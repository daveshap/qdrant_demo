Stop Safari from opening FaceTime when a site contains a phone number When navigating with Safari to some sites that have phone numbers, Safari diligently opens FaceTime when I click on a phone number. Is there a way to prevent this? I am currently tempted to delete the FaceTime app from the Applications folder, but I hope there is a less drastic way to do this.more info : Both Chrome and Firefox propose the option to 'open FT' or cancel. I was looking for a similar setting in Safari.
