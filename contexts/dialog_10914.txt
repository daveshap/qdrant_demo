THE SPOOK: All right. So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
ROYCE: The E-Ringers? Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
THE SPOOK: Congress cuts, military bleeds. But Pentagon's a big place. Let's narrow the sights.
ROYCE: The Navy? They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads. What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
THE SPOOK: Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first. But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
ROYCE: Possibly. Just to spite DeHaven.
THE SPOOK: Hmm. Let's aim higher.
THE SPOOK: The White House. If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades. Why? Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
ROYCE: The first female President?
THE SPOOK: Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story. G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all."
ROYCE: Women.
THE SPOOK: If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
ROYCE: I don't know. Seems...
THE SPOOK: This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school. The implications go way beyond.
ROYCE: Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall. She thinks I do, but...
THE SPOOK: I take it this file is still open.
ROYCE: Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day. Know what I mean?
THE SPOOK: Okay, so now work it from the other end. Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
ROYCE: I don't... What, someone on base? A mole"?"
THE SPOOK: This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook. but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it. A man-in-place. Makes everything very controllable.
