My Gf doesn’t treat me right
Ok so ive been dating her for almost 2 years now and she has been treating me like shit recently. She always ignores my texts and whenever i try and talk to her she makes it seem like she is not interested anymore. Not only does it hurt my feelings but it makes me worried that she is going to break up with me. Ive tried to take her out but she always refuses and she honestly doesn’t care about my feelings anymore. Not only that her friends were telling me she was texting a guy for 3 hours straight and i talked to her about it and she no to everything. I honestly dont know what to do one day she actually made me cry a little because she said she doesnt want to talk to me for the whole day. Im not so good when it comes to feelings im a very sensitive guy but i can hide my feelings super well i dont know how. Please tell me what i can do to make her happy again i dont k know whats wrong with her i really dont want to break up with her or her cheating on me. Please tell me im desperate
