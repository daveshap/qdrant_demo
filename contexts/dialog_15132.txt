SENA: Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
RUBY: This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
SENA: No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy... And I'm a bed-wetter.
RUBY: Well, I definitely feel sorry for you. August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
SENA: I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
RUBY: So?
SENA: I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
RUBY: That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
SENA: None of that's true?
RUBY: Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake... People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
SENA: So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
RUBY: My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
