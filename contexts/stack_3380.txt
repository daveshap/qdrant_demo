Short story of a man whose reality would gradually become a weird dream I read it years ago. It told the story of a man whose reality would gradually become a weird dream, while his dreams became as ordinary as real life can be.At some point in the story, the concerned witnesses an incredible time jump, as his watch's hand moves instantly by half a dial or so...I think he also had a psychologist monitoring his case.
