I got ghosted
(27M) Not the first time I've been ghosted or done the ghosting, but it's the first time in a while that I was looking forward to going out on a first date. I just want to stop thinking about the fact I was so excited to meet someone new. I have my own online business so meeting women has become increasingly more difficult. I've been on a few dates during the past year but none really got me feeling this way even though I hadn't met the girl yet. I think I need to stop trying dating apps.

Sorry for the venting.
