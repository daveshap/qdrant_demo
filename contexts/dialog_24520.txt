KELVIN: Rheya --
RHEYA: Don't call me that.
KELVIN: Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here. You are her, you are Rheya.
RHEYA: I'm disgusting.

KELVIN: Rheya, I am not going back. I'm staying here with you.
RHEYA: Then you'll die.
KELVIN: I want every second I can get with you.
