How to Thank A Recruiter
Hello! I recently obtained a new job through a recruiter. He reached out to me with a potential job that I actually ended up getting. I don’t want him to get in trouble but I was desperate to get out of the situation I was in before. I’ve thanked him quite a few times. I want to buy him a gift card to a place he goes to often, as we did chat about our personal-ish lives. Is this acceptable? Or should I just leave it as thanking him?
