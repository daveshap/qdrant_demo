ANNIE: And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name."
PAUL: It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
ANNIE: You--fooler...! Did I do good?
PAUL: You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
ANNIE: But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
PAUL: C'mere, I'll show you.
ANNIE: Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
PAUL: I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
ANNIE: Thank you for thinking of me. Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
PAUL: No, just the paper will be fine.
ANNIE: Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
PAUL: Annie, what's the matter?
ANNIE: What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? You bought the wrong paper
