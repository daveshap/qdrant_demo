I’m so scared I’m going to lose my wonderful partner because of my depressive moods and anxiety
I have days where I am happy, fun, sociable and we are so happy together. And then I have days where I’m angry, screaming, hurting myself and inconsolable. Not once has he ever ever complained, he talks me through my panic attacks and my bad days and loves me and supports me. He is amazing but I’m scared he’s going to have enough one day. We are 24 and probably moving onto the next step of moving in/engagement in the next few years but I’m scared he’s not going to want this life forever and move on to a happy easy going girl. I need to change now before I push him away 

Edit: thankyou so much to everyone who took the time to reply, especially those with long thought out messages. I have booked a counselling session this week and going to see my GP! Also wanting to take on all the other bits of advice that I can start doing independently. My partner and I are both experiencing periods of depression so sharing this with him so we can help each other. Much appreciated everyone, love this support all over the world. X
