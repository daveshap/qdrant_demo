MOM: I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
DAD: I'll take you to school.
MOM: You don't have to. The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.
