Exporting bounding area only via ArcGIS Pro? I use ArcGIS Pro to export a layout as jpg format image. I just wonder if any tools in ArcGIS pro can help me export the polygon area only and remove or symbolize the rest area as grey? My quick thought is that it may not directly operate on the basemap because so far I didn\u2019t find any easy tool to either symbolize the out-of-bound area into grey or other style to distinguish it from the bounding area.I guess if I need to copy the map view into an imagery first and then dealing with it as an image file and crop it further.
