In light of all the Penn waitlist posts, I wanted to share my "no u" letter after Penn rejected me
Dear Penn Admissions,


The Committee of Undergraduate Rejections has reviewed your rejection letter denying me from Penn’s Class of 2024. It is with great regret that I must inform you that I am unable to accept your rejection.


**Q**: Wait a minute, is this an appeal letter?

**A**: It is indeed. 


**Q**: Can’t this schmuck read our FAQ, which says no appeals?

**A**: In the light of unprecedented events (COVID-19), I figured I’d take a risk. 


**Q**: Is this for real, or a joke?

**A**: No offense taken if you have a good laugh and ignore it. Admissions officers work hard and deserve to have a chuckle once in a while. But extraordinary times call for extraordinarily gutsy decisions.


Since applying, here’s some stuff I’ve been up to:


I became a mod on A2C. I can absolutely destroy your reputation for all future applicants if I don't get in, so I'm expecting my acceptance package soon. [No, I didn't actually write this, there were actual updates but obviously no one wants to read that.]


I’d also like to reiterate my interest in Penn, one of the reasons I made the difficult decision to reject your rejection. [Boring why Penn stuff goes here].


Once again, I truly appreciate your interest in rejecting me, however, I wish you the best in accommodating me for an additional spot in Penn’s Class of 2024. If an accommodation is made, I would absolutely attend. In light of the difficult circumstances of COVID-19, I am willing to accept a spot in Penn’s Class of 2025, or a transfer option after a year at another university. 


Please note that this decision is not a reflection upon your institution, but rather one that reflects the difficulties of college applications. As I have been rejected from several institutions, I had to make the difficult choice to reject one of my rejections. I hope you understand.


Sincerely,


u/LRFE
