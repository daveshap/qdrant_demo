GARLAND: We have to talk a little business. I've just been on the phone to Los Angeles. Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to put you under contract. They've offered you a thousand dollars a week. I think I can get them to go as high as two.
BARTON: To do what?
GARLAND: What do you do far a living?
BARTON: I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
GARLAND: Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night â€“ if the show sells out. Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
BARTON: To see pap.
GARLAND: Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
BARTON: I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
GARLAND: I'd say you're already enjoying some.
