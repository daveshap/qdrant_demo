Puncutation Mistake in an Email to Interviewer
This is probably a stupid post but I need to get this out of my head. So me and my interviewer were talking about scheduling up an interview and she asked me if I'm interested so I of course replied that I'm still very interested. So usually for my signatures, I just type "Thank You" and then my name under. This time I forgot to put a period after the "Thank You." How bad do you think this is and will it affect anything?
