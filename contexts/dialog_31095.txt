BOBBY: How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
SAILOR: Forty bucks...
BOBBY: This is easy money, pardner... No ones gonna get hurt in this thing... And I don't think you can afford not to take it... I'll be bringin' the Eldo 'round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin'... If you ain't a pussy - you'll be there.
SAILOR: I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
BOBBY: Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
SAILOR: Yeah... yeah... I guess so... That kind'a money'd get us a long way down that yellow brick road...
SAILOR: ...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
BOBBY: Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
LULA: You been drinkin', huh?
SAILOR: Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
LULA: Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
SAILOR: That smell's still fillin' this room good.
LULA: Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
SAILOR: And Bobby too, I hear...
LULA: Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
SAILOR: You talk to 'im some?...
LULA: Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
SAILOR: Oughta make 'em happy.
LULA: So where'd you say you was?
SAILOR: Went with Bobby.
LULA: Sail?
SAILOR: Uh-huh?
LULA: Let's leave here.
SAILOR: We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
LULA: I mean tomorrow.
SAILOR: We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
LULA: Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
