SHINZON: Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does. Or maybe Iâ€™ll snap its ugly head off.
PICARD: What's this all about?
SHINZON: It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
PICARD: You're not Reman.
SHINZON: And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see? Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
PICARD: I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
SHINZON: I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
PICARD: I won't defend my life to you.
SHINZON: My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
PICARD: If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
SHINZON: Oh, but it does. We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
PICARD: Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
SHINZON: It amazes me how little you know yourself.
PICARD: I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
SHINZON: I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.
