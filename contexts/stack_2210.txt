What are the exact percentages for likelihood of getting 3 diamonds from a diamond ore with Fortune 3? I have a modification that adds a furnace that doubles the amount of ingots produced from an ore when smelted. I want to know if using this furnace to smelt diamond ore would be better than using a fortune 3 diamond pickaxe. So what is the likelihood of getting three (or more maybe) diamonds from an ore with a fortune 3 pickaxe so I can determine if the furnace is better to use because it gives a guaranteed two diamonds. Thanks!
