First Qualifying Exam This Next Week. Nervous, but Might Get Masters!
Good evening, folks!  


This post is a general sharing of goings on, personal progress, but I do have a question which I'll get to - I promise.  


Next Thursday, I'll be doing my first qualifying exam for a Masters degree in English. Entering my Ph.D. program with a Bachelors, this exam will mark the end of my second year, and ten years of education building to being the first person in my family to earn a university degree, let alone professional one. I'm excited, but with everything going, my family is more excited for my nephew "graduating" middle school than me getting an MA, which hurts, to be honest.  


Getting to the questions:

* Did you feel any different getting your Masters and being in seminar, discussions?
* For those of with your Masters, do you identify as a professor, or still an instructor? I know some professors, faculty argue you can only be a professor with a Ph.D., so just curious how you handle it, or if it's an issue for any of you at all.  


Stay safe, stay healthy, and as I say to my students: stay off the damn beaches!
