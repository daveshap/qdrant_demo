MEGAN: ...I can't remember.
DAVID: That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
MEGAN: It means we're probably to tired to remember.
MEGAN: Is that what you wanted to ask me?
DAVID: Yes.
MEGAN: Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
DAVID: No that's it.
