Does a quadratic log-likehood mean the MLE is (approximately) normally distributed? So, in the usual case, one can prove from the asymptotic normality of a maximum likelihood estimator that the corresponding log-likehood surface is quadratic near the MLE (e.g. in the proof of the correspondence between Fisher information and the variance of the MLE).My question is, does the opposite hold necessarily? I.e. suppose I know that my log-likelihood surface is quadratic around the best fit: can I then infer that the corresponding MLE is (approximately) normally distributed?
