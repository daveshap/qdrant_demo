My family wants me to be a doctor and I'm not sure about it
    Before all else, a mandatory "english is not my first language", sorry if I make mistakes.
    So, I am in my junior year of high school, and my future always was a topic at family dinners and such, and my parents want to see me in the S.T.E.M. field, preferably something regarding medicine. And for the most part I actually agree with them, since I study a lot of these subjects right now and there a lot of jobs that provide you with financial stability in that field. In my country, when you get into highschool you have to choose a profile, I am in a natural sciences class. ((Basically a lot of chemistry, biology and physics))
     On the other hand, I have a passion for drawing. I had my big Moana moment one day, while I was studying biology I started drawing and I got really freaked out, cuz that felt like seeing my future ahead of me, always having to do something I don't enjoy as much as drawing, and that becoming a secondary thing in my life. 
      I want to know if I could be an animator, or something related to it, like idk, characterdesign. But in my country there is no animation major at any university and I don't want to rely on my parents for years to pay for my studies abroad only to study something they don't agree with. They already pay for my extracullicular biology classes, so telling them that I want to do something different would result in a huge fight.
     I just want you guys to...reassure me that what I'm doing is the right thing and I am not messing up my life right now, because honestly I'm afraid :c
