I’m 17 and my life is over..,
I was finally becoming happy. I had a job I loved, I was coming to terms with my family troubles and leaving them behind. I’ve made friends better than any I’ve ever had before and yet I am depressed. I used to think I was depressed an anxious the whole way though high school. I wasn’t depressed, I was sad. Maybe more than my friends yes, but not depressed. And I wasn’t anxious, I was just a nervous kid and I forced myself out of my comfort zone and overcame my nervousness. 

7 months ago, I got tinnitus. An incurable chronic condition which causes a ringing in my head. For 3 months I was coping with it. Until January. I began to develop hypercausis, a side effect of the condition. This side effect is extremely severe. It causes me to perceive normal sound as painful. I am unable to continue my passion of music and playing instruments and it makes everything else in my life almost unbearable. Around the same time I developed and anxiety disorder. My heart now constantly pounds in my chest and I have frequent panic attacks. 

I haven’t heard silence in 7 months, and I never will again.

My heart hasn’t stopped pounding for 4 months, and it never will again.

This is not living, this is coping.

All the positive thinking in the world isn’t going to cure me. Nothing will.

I have good friends and a family who care about me, but it doesn’t matter. None of it does.
