How can I use Charlieplexing with common anode RGB LEDs? I've an ESP32-based dev board (LoLin32) which has 26 digital I/O pins. I want to connect 25 common anode RGB LEDs to it. Connecting them in the 'normal' way would require 75 I/O pins, which I don't have ofcourse. I've heard that you could use Charlieplexing to connect n*(n-1) LEDs to n pins, but I don't quite understand how I could use Charlieplexing with common anode RGB LEDs.Edit: it doesn't neccessarily have to be Charlieplexing, other solutions are welcome too. I know about WS2812-ish things, but that's something I wanted to avoid.
