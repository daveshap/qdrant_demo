After months of not being paid today my boss paid the 4months he owed me! Beers are on me tonight!
So my boss made a mistake with my contract when it got renewed and he couldnt pay me, in Februari we found out about the mistake and that left me stranded, because the earliest he could pay me was the 24th of march, but that didnt work either since the dude that had to fix the mistakes was on vacation till the 25th, so now after 4 months of being a poor dude. 

the money is finally here, 

Jeeh for me!
