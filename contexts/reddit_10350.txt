Suicide is like a security blanket
The thought of suicide always gives me relief whenever I feel like everything is going wrong. I could easily get rid of myself and I would no longer have to participate in this shit existence. I can’t imagine actually growing old. I don’t understand how others can magically plan out their lives while actually having real goals for themselves and not once think about harming or killing themselves. It’s so foreign to me.
