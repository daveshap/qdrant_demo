LEDNOV: We got to get movin'.
MCCALL: What for?
LEDNOV: Because there's a man I want to see.
MCCALL: He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
LEDNOV: I said let's go.
MCCALL: One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
LEDNOV: I said I had a guy to see and I'm going to see him.
