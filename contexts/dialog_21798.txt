DAVE WILKIE: Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
WILLCOX HILLYER: Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
DAVE WILKIE: Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
WILLCOX HILLYER: Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
