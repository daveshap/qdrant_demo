STRASSER: You repeat Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others."
RENAULT: Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
STRASSER: Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
RICK: Make it official, if you like.
STRASSER: What is your nationality?
RICK: I'm a drunkard.
RENAULT: That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
RICK: I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
STRASSER: I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
RICK: There seems to be no secret about that.
STRASSER: Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
RICK: It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
