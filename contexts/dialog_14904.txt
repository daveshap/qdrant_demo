JIM: All right, all right. Break it up.
BILL: Where you going, boss?
JIM: I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
FRANK: Bill.
BILL: Hey, where y'at, Frank? You're wasting your time here. Big Jim gave strict orders. No FBI allowed.
FRANK: It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
BILL: Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew...
FRANK: Your boss got a serious problem, Bill. Real serious. We know what's been going on at your office
BILL: Yeah, I guess you do.
FRANK: You've got nothin', Bill. I'm talking as a friend now. You're riding on the Titanic. Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
BILL: Frank, I don't want to hear it.
FRANK: Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
FRANK: Who do you think fed him that information? Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life. You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
BILL: No, I'm not...
FRANK: Yes, you are. Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger. Castro did. But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die. That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison. Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you! You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up. If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me. Listen real hard.
X: Jim Garrison?
JIM: Yes.
X: I'm glad you came. I'm sorry about the precautions.
JIM: Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
X: I could give you a false name, but I won't. Just call me X.
JIM: I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever. If this is another type of threat, I don't...
X: I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you. But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
