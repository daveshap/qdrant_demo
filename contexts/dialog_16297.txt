JESSICA: You could have called me yourself.
LOGAN: But I wasn't sure you'd come.
JESSICA: Here I am. Shall I come in?
LOGAN: I couldn't get you out of my mind.
JESSICA: I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
LOGAN: Maybe... sure...
JESSICA: Thanks... but I have the choice.
LOGAN: Of course.
JESSICA: Then it's still no.
JESSICA: You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
LOGAN: You know.
JESSICA: I don't believe you. There has to be more.
LOGAN: All right.
JESSICA: Why show me?
LOGAN: I'm going to run.
JESSICA: Why tell me?
LOGAN: You know something.
JESSICA: About running, dying what?
LOGAN: Both... running's what I'm interested in.
JESSICA: I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
LOGAN: It's different now. Help me.
JESSICA: How can I?
JESSICA: Where did you get that?
LOGAN: A Runner gave it to me.
JESSICA: And then you killed him, right?
LOGAN: I let him go... believe me.
JESSICA: I don't..
LOGAN: Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
JESSICA: Please? What friends?
LOGAN: I don't have much time.
JESSICA: I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
LOGAN: And I never heard of Sanctuary.
