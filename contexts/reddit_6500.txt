How does the “training period” work within the US ?
So I’m currently a college freshman and a friend of mine who resides within the UK told me about how he had an 3 month “testing period” and how he got the job but the friend who came with him didn’t and got fired. So I wondered how this would work within the US when I apply and got a position on say something like Amazon.  (The company he now works for is apparently a major one, on the same levels as Apple, Google etc).
