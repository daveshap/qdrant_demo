VIVIAN: Why do guys always know how to hit a woman? Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode. What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
EDWARD: Not all men hit. And no one is going to hit you anymore.
VIVIAN: Right. You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'? I heard what you did with Kross.
EDWARD: It was a business decision.
EDWARD: I got tired of hating my father.
VIVIAN: It was good.
EDWARD: It felt good.
EDWARD: You're packing.
VIVIAN: I'm leaving. Don't ya see? If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to. What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No. I'll take my money now, please.
VIVIAN: Aw, don't... no...
EDWARD: Stay with me tonight. Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
VIVIAN: I do. I do want to. That's why I'm leaving. That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now. I want a guy like you for real. Not because you buy me things and give me money. The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
VIVIAN: I didn't think so.
EDWARD: Vivian...
VIVIAN: It's not your fault. You're right. Kit's right. But I want the fairy tale.
