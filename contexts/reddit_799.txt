Apartment or Car note?
Hey, I am turning 18 soon. And Iâ€™m lost. I want to get a brand new camaro. ( like really really bad ) but my mom wants me to get an apartment. I get paid $12.25 an hour but only working 19 or less hours a week. I plan on quitting my current job and get a high paying job working FULL TIME. Any advice ?
