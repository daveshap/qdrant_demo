What kinds of SA jobs are there and what is the right fit for me?
Hello everyone,

I'm thinking about pursuing a career in student affairs, but am a bit overwhelmed by the wide variety of job options available. I'd really like to work face-to-face with students on a regular basis and am considering academic advising or financial aid counseling. Are there other types of jobs in student affairs where I could work closely with students?

Thank you!
