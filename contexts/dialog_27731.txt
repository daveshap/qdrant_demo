GRAY: Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy. Not at all friendly.
MACFARLANE: That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
GRAY: You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy. I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
MACFARLANE: I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray -- -- for auld lang syne.
