SAM: Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
JACK: I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
SAM: She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
JACK: Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
SAM: You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
JACK: I do. Goodbye.
SAM: It could all be coincidental.
JACK: There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them. This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
SAM: Jack, she's innocent!
JACK: Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
SAM: Yes we have, Jack!
JACK: Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
