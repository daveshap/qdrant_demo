My girlfriend's password is her exes anniversary date
We've been dating for a while and she gave me her password as a sign of trust. I didn't ask for it and I've never used it. But then I realized that her password is a date and it's her and her exes anniversary date. I haven't brought it up to her but should I tell her to change it?
