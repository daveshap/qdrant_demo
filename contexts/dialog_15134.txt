RUBY: Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
SENA: Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
SENA: The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
RUBY: That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
SENA: It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep. They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
RUBY: Insomnolesence...
SENA: It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now, it's not understood very well.
RUBY: So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
SENA: Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
RUBY: If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
SENA: Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
RUBY: How do we prove it?
SENA: Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious. If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
RUBY: Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
