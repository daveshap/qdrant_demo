BELL: No money in his room there?
ROSCOE: Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
BELL: I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
ROSCOE: It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs. It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
BELL: Yes.
ROSCOE: If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
BELL: Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
ROSCOE: It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
BELL: Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
BELL: ...I don't know what I do feel like.
ROSCOE: Try old" on for size."
BELL: Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
ROSCOE: None of that explains your man though.
BELL: Uh-huh.
ROSCOE: He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
BELL: I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
ROSCOE: Well what would you call him.
BELL: I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
ROSCOE: He's real all right.
BELL: Oh yes.
ROSCOE: All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
BELL: Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
ROSCOE: That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
BELL: Hard to believe.
ROSCOE: Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
