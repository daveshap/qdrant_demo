ROBERTA: And what can you tell us about this...
ENID: Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
ROBERTA: I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves. We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class. Who is responsible for this?
MARGARET: I am.
ROBERTA: Talk to us about it...
MARGARET: It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
ROBERTA: Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
