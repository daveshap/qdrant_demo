ENID: That guy rules!
JOSH: Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
ENID: So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
JOSH: No.
REBECCA: Please Josh?
JOSH: Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
JOSH: Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
ENID: It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
REBECCA: So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
JOSH: He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
ENID: God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
REBECCA: I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
ENID: Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
REBECCA: Look, maybe that's him!
ENID: It's still twenty-five minutes early.
JOSH: Aren't there a million places like this?
ENID: This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
JOSH: So, where's Weird Al"?"
ENID: SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
REBECCA: I want to make love" to him."
ENID: I'm going to tell him you said that.
