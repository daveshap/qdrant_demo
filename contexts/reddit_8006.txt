Folks who started working after undergrad and went back to grad school, how did you make it work going from making middle class salary to $20k/yr stipend?
Guys, 

&#x200B;

I'm a month and a half out of undergrad (BSME) and am working an okay job while thinking about going back to grad school every day.  I come from a not so wealthy family and struggled financially throughout undergrad even with help from family. This is the first time in my life I've had two pennies to rub together and I don't think I can pull off living off of $20k/yr on my own. 

&#x200B;

So, folks who went back to school after working for a while -- how does one accomplish that without risking financial disaster? Sure student loans are an option but I'm really trying to avoid that trap. Is it passive income through real estate investments? Fellowships & scholarships on top of stipend? Royalties from stuff you worked on while making salary?

TIA for your input!
