VICTOR: What is this?
CREATURE: A brain. Extremities.
VICTOR: This was not taken from a grave.
CREATURE: What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
VICTOR: No. I draw the line.
CREATURE: You will honor your promise to me!
VICTOR: I will not! Kill me now!
CREATURE: That is mild compared to what will come. If you deny me my wedding night. I'll be with you on yours.
VICTOR: No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
ELIZABETH: Why the change? What about your work?
VICTOR: It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
ELIZABETH: It is
VICTOR: We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
ELIZABETH: Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
VICTOR: Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay.
ELIZABETH: Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
VICTOR: I do. But you must trust me for now.
