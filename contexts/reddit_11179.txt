My Dad
I haven’t heard from my dad in over a year, he is homeless, family disowned him and he has a drug habit. With whats going on in the world right now I haven’t been able to get my mind off thinking about him and if he is okay. Im so worried and I cant stop crying because there’s nothing I can do. I wish I could call him. I wish he had a phone number. I love you daddy please be okay.
