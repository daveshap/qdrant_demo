Is it okay to quit after you pass probation ?
Hi all

I hope you can give me a bit of guidance. I got headhunted by a recruiter 3 months ago for a accounts receivables role however the work environment is extremely toxic, I am about to pass my probation once I find a new job is it professional to leave after you pass probation.

Thanks in advance
