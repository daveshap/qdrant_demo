Simple darkness sensor with ldr I am stuck on a very simple project since days and i can not figure out what i am doing wrong. The project is about the darkness sensor i.e \"the led should light up automatically in darkness and shutt off in light\". But in my case its the opposite, led turns off in darkness and turns on in light. I am using and have tried almost all the circuit diagrams from youtube tutorials which are almost the same but with few different resistor values. Also they seem to be using the transistor bc 547 while i am using the bc 548 transistor. Please help me understand what i am doing wrong here?
