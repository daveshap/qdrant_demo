ZUKOVSKY: Alright, alright! Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her. Russian stuff.
BOND: And the payoff on the tables?
ZUKOVSKY: A special job. A...a...a submarine.
CHRISTMAS: What?
ZUKOVSKY: To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
BOND: Whereâ€™s the sub going?!
ZUKOVSKY: No! Get me out!
BOND: This is too big for even you. Where is it?
ZUKOVSKY: This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
ZUKOVSKY: No! Bond!
CHRISTMAS: Bond!
