AITA for using my grandfather’s onyx to make pans without asking?
So my grandpa has a TON of onyx, so i figured I’d put it to good use. I made some beautiful pans i was going to send him but he got pissed that i took all the onyx and now all he has is quartz. I love him and all but come on!! Who needs all those gems?!?

Edit: I just realized its Thursday for me. Shoutout to different time zones.
