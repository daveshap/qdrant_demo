GRANDPA: Are we havin' fun or what?
SAM: I thought we were goin' into town.
GRANDPA: I hate goin' into town. That's about as close to town as I like to get.
SAM: What did <u>you</u> do last night? You look wasted.
MICHAEL: I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
SAM: You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
MICHAEL: What would that make Mom?
SAM: You're right... not even to mention you and me.
