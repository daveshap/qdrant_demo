Does a Bayesian interpretation exist for REML? Is a Bayesian interpretation of REML available? To my intuition, REML bears a strong likeness to so-called empirical Bayes estimation procedures, and I wonder if some kind of asymptotic equivalence (under some suitable class of priors, say) has been demonstrated. Both empirical Bayes and REML seem like 'compromised' estimation approaches undertaken in the face of nuisance parameters, for example.Mainly, what I seek by this question is the high-level insight that these sorts of arguments tend to yield. Of course, if an argument of this nature for some reason cannot usefully be pursued for REML, an explanation for why this is so would also deliver welcome insight!
