Can I be held accountable for data I generated that is unethically manipulated by someone else?
Brief background. I recently left grad school with a masters because after working on a continuation of someone else’s project, I discovered that this person fabricated most of their data. I could not reproduce anything they did, nor could three other lab mates or my advisor. Once I found irrefutable evidence of fabrication, I presented it to my advisor, but they were incredibly defensive, denied everything and ultimately told me “Well X saw the phenotype and saw Y, Z results, so you should be able to do the same thing.” X being the person who fabricated the data. I ultimately left feeling pressured to fabricate data and decided to get the fuck out of there. I should also mention that part of my advisors argument in response to the fabrication was “Well none of its published,” as if this makes it any less unethical that this person fabricated data?!? I also learned after I left that my advisor is poorly respected by others in the field, specifically because other researchers question the integrity of their findings. 

Now I’ve left, graduated, already started working a job I love and my advisor has asked for all my data. I know this is common practice, but I know they plan to use my data to publish a paper. What if they unethically manipulate my data? Am I liable for this? I already told my advisor I have no interest in being an author on this paper because I do not want to be associated with potentially fabricated data. I also plan to report them if I see that they publish data that I know to be fabricated, but until they publish it, I don’t really feel like there is much I can do. 

Thanks in advance for your advice. Happy sciencing!
