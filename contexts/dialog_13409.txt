HOLLAND: It is not beautiful.
BETSY: You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
HOLLAND: It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand. Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror. Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence. There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
BETSY: You can't really believe that.
