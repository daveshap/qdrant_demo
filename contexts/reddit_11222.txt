I like a guy and I'm a guy.
I'm terribly in love with this guy, but I can't do anything about it because I'd be judged and shunned away. I hated myself all the time for this. I see him everyday in class but I can't go and talk to him because I'm afraid of all the homophobic people I have in my life. Nobody would ever accept me for who I am. 

The fact that I can't do anything to pursue the feelings I have for him is eating me up. I can't eat, I can't sleep I can't focus on anything. Why me? What did I do to have feelings for someone from the same sex and mind numbingly doing absolutely nothing about it. 

Why can't I just be normal? It's the worst punishment anyone could ever go through in their lives. I terribly hate myself for falling for him. I can't live with this despair anymore. I feel so hopeless and helpless. I feel like dying, just to get away from this pain. The pain of having so much dreams and hopes but not being able to go a step further to make it possible. 

It makes me so depress, I'm not that kind of person but keeping the feelings for him to myself doesn't help a bit. Oh my God! why all these happening to me?
