I'm a COVID-19 nurse in an intensive care unit, and I can't cope
Hello. 

I'm 26 year old and currently work at a COVID-19 ward full of very ill patients.   
I've never struggled as much as I am right now. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I am isolating myself from everyone because I'm afraid of making them ill. I have nothing left to give.
