IKE: Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis. This is King of Blue"! This is the original recording. Hard to find in good condition. Where did you find this?"
MAGGIE: It was in the attic. It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
IKE: It's valuable. Hang onto it.
MAGGIE: No. You take it.
IKE: Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
MAGGIE: No -- I'm cleaning an attic. I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
