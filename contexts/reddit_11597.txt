Last year in high-school and I still have no idea what I want to do.
I was never the most committed worker. I was always a lazy slob. But somehow I always managed to follow through the stuff I wanted to do. I was always able to take as much time as possible with everything I do. Hell, there are still creative projects of mine, that I'm working on for a few years now. They're laying there waiting for being finished, which will eventually happen.... probably.

In short, whatever I did, or planned to do, I eventually started doing, working on them for years, finishing them slowly. I like to leave homework to the last day too.

With this altitude, I was able to crawl through high-school. Five years even, because of the preparatory first year.

The thing is, deciding what I want to do with myself, isn't one of the projects that I was able to finish. I'm still completely in the dark about it. Only ideas to play around with for a month, then comes the next. Truck driver? Teacher? The current one is journalist. The best probably would be some kind of creative job, but that's only going to earn me enough if I'm really well-known.

I don't want to be like my brother, who just hangs around playing League of Legends and complaining about his shitty job all day. I don't want a shitty job. I don't want to be trapped within excruciating routines. The worst part is, that I'm too much like my brother. I also tend to hang on the computer all day, do nothing productive for weeks.

I'm trying to change that behavior. It's one of my ongoing projects.
