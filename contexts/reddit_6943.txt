The state of the labor market - Have any of you been laid off or had your company close?
I see a lot of people that I know across the country being laid off or having companies close down. I'm just curious on your experiences since we keep hearing about an upcoming recession. Has it seemed worse recently than normal (less postings, less call backs or interviews, less offers), or does it feel the same?
