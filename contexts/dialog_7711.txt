AMBER: So, what do I say?
LORETTA: Simple. Just say, Mom
AMBER: Oh my God. I'm so dead...
LORETTA: Yeah, you betcha...
ANNETTE: Go on! Get out!
AMBER: Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
AMBER: Mom!
ANNETTE: I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
AMBER: Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
ANNETTE: What?!
AMBER: Ow!
ANNETTE: Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too.
AMBER: Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
ANNETTE: You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
AMBER: Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
ANNETTE: Let me tell you scary
AMBER: That's it, I'm goin'...
ANNETTE: Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
AMBER: God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'.
ANNETTE: It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
ANNETTE: C'mere. I love you so much.
AMBER: I love you much.
LORETTA: Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
AMBER: No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
