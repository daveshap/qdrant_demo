Does it actually matter to recruiters whether you have done a 2 year economics&finance master or a 2 year economics master with a minor in finance?
I was discussing with a friend whether it actually made a difference to recruiters whether someone studied:

a 2-year master "Economics & Finance"

a 1-year masters in Economics & a one year master in Finance seperately

a 2 year master in economics with a minor in Finance

Does it matter? And if so, which one is better than the other?
