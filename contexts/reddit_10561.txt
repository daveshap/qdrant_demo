I tried to hang myself tonight
Self-explanatory.  The rope wasn't long enough, I couldn't make a secure knot over the light fixture. I kicked the chair, felt the pull on my neck and it immediately came loose and I fell on my back. Got right back up and tried again, same thing. I can't do anything right. I wish it had worked. I'm so tired. I'm tired of myself. I'm tired of my shitty artistic projects that go nowhere and don't amount to anything. I'm tired of my job. I'm tired of school. I'm tired of everyone treating me like I'm not a human being or I'm invisible. I'm tired of the citizens bank atm that never works. I'm tired of feeling like a disappointment to everyone.  I'm tired of all of the thoughts I can't stop and the emotional trauma I'm going through. It just keeps getting worse and worse and I just want it to end.  The person I love the most continuously treats me like nothing.  I tried to stop drinking and cutting and everything's just gotten worse.  Things keep setting me off and I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I'm going to buy a longer length of rope tomorrow.  I feel like everyone would be better off if I was dead and everyone would love me more. Everyone loves someone more when they're dead and I don't feel like anyone does now and its all I want.  I know everyone will move on and be fine and I'm tired of being a disappointment and a burden.   I can't even talk about what's driving me the most with anyone because it makes me feel ashamed and humiliated. Its never going to stop. God I just wish it had worked tonight. I'm very drunk, I'm sorry.
