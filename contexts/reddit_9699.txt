Grad Assistants/Fellowships working remotely?
Just got notification that the possibility of my Graduate Fellowship being remote for some time is very likely.

How has being a grad student/assistant/fellowship been remotely and any advice for working remotely? 
I specifically am working as an advisor to 1st year education/social policy students.
