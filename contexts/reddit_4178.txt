Got stood up tonight
That was cool. Been talking to this girl for a week. She asked me to hang out and I canceled plans to do so. Set a time to meet at a bar a couple of hours ago. She never showed and stopped responding to messages. Thatâ€™s cool I guess. Had a couple of beers and it was a Pokestop. Man this shit hurts. Online dating sucks
