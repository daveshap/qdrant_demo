Why are so many people from places like Central America seeking asylum in the US and how does US law apply to the waves of migrants currently trying to enter the country?
I am trying to figure out what is going on with the mass waves of migrants traveling up to try to enter the US and seek asylum. As I understand, under [current US law](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/obtaining-asylum-united-states) migrants can seek asylum by crossing illegally and turning themselves in (common), or be caught trying to enter the US illegally. 

According to [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-constitutional-rights-do-undocumented-immigrants-have), migrants seeking asylum have a right to a lawyer and due process during the whole thing. They are booked, then released on bond with a pending court date to show back up for a judge to give them the verdict on their asylum case.  Apparently the number of undocumented migrants who fail to appear on their court date rose significantly in the past few years [from 24% to ~40% between 2012 and 2016](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/26/wolf-blitzer/majority-undocumented-immigrants-show-court-data-s/) many of whom illegally remain in the US. 

Why are migrants fleeing Central America and [rejecting offers to stay in Mexico](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/migrant-caravan-members-reject-offer-to-stay-in-mexico-no-were-heading-north-2018-10-27/)?

And if immigration law says those seeking asylum should be allowed in until their case is decided, what is the US doing about the thousands of people trying to make a run for the fence en masse?
