Anybody else enjoy the rain to calm them down?
I’m sure a lot of you do, but I’m just having a shitty Monday and feeling extra depressed today for some reason. I saw it’s going to rain for the rest of the day once I get home from work, I got really excited and I can’t wait to sit at home to watch and listen to the rain to calm me down, it helps so much.

I hope you guys are having a great Monday.
