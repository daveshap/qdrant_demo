Advice for finding temporary jobs?
I am a college student. I don’t know if I’ll go back to school in the fall because of Covid-19, but my resume necessarily implies that I will be gone in two months because my college and my hometown are on different sides of the country. Does anyone have advice for finding jobs that would be willing to take on shorter term employees right now? I was supposed to have an internship this summer but it got cancelled and now I’ve been searching for a job for a month and can’t find anything.
