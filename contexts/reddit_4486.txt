I found help!
I had been in an impossible rut for several decades. To be honest, I thought that's how the rest of my life was going to be. Down and out no matter what. Suicidal ideation, self harm, the works. I hit an extraordinary low and began reaching out all over the place for help. Even more than usual. I was afraid of myself. In the midst of all this I met a psychiatrist. The rare kind who actually wanted to help instead of just giving me whatever drug I told them I needed. And that's where my leaf actually began to turn. See, everyone else always told me it was just treatment resistant depression and that was that. My new doctor took a look at my history (and played some pretty weird mind games with me) and came to a startling conclusion. I'm not depressed at all. Well, at least not only depressed. I'm bipolar!! Type 2 to be specific with a tendency toward depression as opposed to mania. That's why nothing was ever working. 30 years of barking up the wrong tree!  Believe me, I was not happy about the news at first: "What the fuck do you mean I'm bipolar? Have you not been listening to me this while time?" The signs were there: good grades that dropped way off as a younger person despite ability, a low tolerance for those I didn't like, a very short fuse, overall intensity, crudeness, and so much more. But how would I have known? Everyone else just said I was depressed and a little weird. I never really questioned it. I'm on a pretty heavy mood stabilizer now and have been for a couple months. Intrusive thoughts have dropped considerably and a ton more positive changes. Things aren't perfect and they never will be but damn are they looking up!
