MICHAEL: This is kind of a cool place.
SAM: I'm so excited I just can't hide it. I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
MICHAEL: Will you give Mom a break?
SAM: Grandpa does not own a T.V. Have you noticed? There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV. I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
MICHAEL: Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
SAM: Even poor people have T.V.s
GRANDPA: Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
LUCY: A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation. We've all been through enough. Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
GRANDPA: Ouch, my hair...
LUCY: When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
MICHAEL: This room is mine.
SAM: I was here first.
MICHAEL: Okay. I'll flip you for it.
