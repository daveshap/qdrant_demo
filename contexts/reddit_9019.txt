Accepting foreign aid to interfere in US elections
Given that election law "prohibits contributions, donations and other expenditures by “foreign nationals” in any federal, state or local election as well an exchange of any “thing of value.”" [source](https://lawandcrime.com/politics/aba-legal-fact-check-when-is-it-illegal-for-foreign-nationals-to-influence-u-s-elections/) and how it relates to the 2016 election Assume that the following is true:

"...I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics..." DT 8/6/18

AND

"Separately, in April 2016, attorney Marc Elias hired Fusion GPS to investigate Trump on behalf of Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). In June 2016, Fusion GPS subcontracted Steele to research and compile the dossier." [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

The Trump Tower meeting happened because the Russian government offered "something of value". Also the DNC and Clinton Campaign paid Fusion GPS and Steele (British national) for "something of value"

Is the only real difference that one side was offered aid and the other paid for it?

I don't want to justify or equate the two, I just seriously want to know.
