AUSTIN: Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
DR. EVIL: No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma. All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
DR. EVIL: Release the sharks! All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
FRAU FARBISSINA: Dr. Evil?
DR. EVIL: Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
FRAU FARBISSINA: It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
DR. EVIL: Right. Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
DR. EVIL: What is it now?
FRAU FARBISSINA: Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
DR. EVIL: I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
FRAU FARBISSINA: Sea bass.
DR. EVIL: Right.
FRAU FARBISSINA: They're mutated sea bass.
DR. EVIL: Really? Are they ill-tempered?
FRAU FARBISSINA: Please allow me to demonstrate.
DR. EVIL: Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is. Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
SCOTT EVIL: Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
DR. EVIL: No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
SCOTT EVIL: I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
DR. EVIL: No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
