MIKE: Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
ROB: Oh, like that song...
MIKE: ...A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat."
ROB: Him?
MIKE: He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
TRENT: Oh, it's on, baby...
SUE: ...It's on.
MIKE: There are so many beautiful women here.
ROB: It's unbelievable.
MIKE: I got to at least try once.
ROB: You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
MIKE: No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
ROB: Go for it, man.
MIKE: I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
ROB: I'll be your winger.
