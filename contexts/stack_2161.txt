Can I change the color of my lips? Playing Mass Effect: Andromeda, I have my character customized to be exactly as I want... except one thing. The lips on my character are a godawful shade of bright pink, and do not match at all with my complexion. I tried to look for a way to change it in the character creator, but I couldn't find it. I've also searched all over for a console command to fix it and came up with the same result.So that leads me to this question of how can I change my character's lip color; both during character creation for future reference and after the character has been created?
