DAVID: Hi, Jack.
JACK: Hi, David.
DAVID: What can I say, Jack?
JACK: You don't have to say anything.
DAVID: Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
JACK: If I was still alive, I probably would.
DAVID: You look awful.
JACK: Thank you.
DAVID: I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
JACK: What about the zoo?
DAVID: Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
JACK: I want you to meet some people.
JACK: David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
DAVID: Hello.
JACK: Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
