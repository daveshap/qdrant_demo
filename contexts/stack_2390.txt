What is this larger gun indication on the minimap? Something in PUBG Mobile, on my minimap, I see a bullet indication. This means that a gunshot can be heard from the direction it's pointing. However sometimes, I get this larger indicator that points in the general direction. What type of gun is this gunshot? Is it a suppressor on a gun?Edit: If this helps, I was playing the Mini Zone mode.Here is a screenshot I managed to get during game play.(Look at the minimap)
