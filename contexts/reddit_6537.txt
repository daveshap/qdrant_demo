Ways to be professional at work but at the same time be nice and friendly?
In my old job I got real close to coworkers real fast. We talked about everything, yes everything. Even sex. 
Idk if I should continue doing this in my new workplace. I love being close to new friends but also donâ€™t want to come off as like.... not professional?

So how do you stay professional at work & maintain friendships & not give too much information about yourself?
