KOESSLER: How do you feel, Agent
MACKELWAY: Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
KOESSLER: Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
MACKELWAY: He got away. I had him. He got away.
KOESSLER: Do you think he singled you out?
MACKELWAY: No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
