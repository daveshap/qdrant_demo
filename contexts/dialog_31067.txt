SAILOR: You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
LULA: I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
SAILOR: Just part of life on the road, peanut.
LULA: Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
