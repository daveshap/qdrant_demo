Honors Housing- Living Learning Question
I am working for a small college that just finished their first full year with an Honors house. When the students sign up for the special housing, they sign a contract saying that they will attend at least two programs and a community builder each semester. The first semester worked well because the students ran the risk of getting removed from housing, however, during the second semester, we struggled more with attendance towards the end because they were about to move out anyway. What's the best way to insure attendance without charging students?
