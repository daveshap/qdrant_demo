ALEXANDER: I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
MARA: That machine --
ALEXANDER: Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
MARA: How long ago?
ALEXANDER: More than 800,000 years.
MARA: Why?
ALEXANDER: Why not?
MARA: Why would you do that?
MARA: I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
ALEXANDER: Yes. Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
MARA: I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
ALEXANDER: For a time it was astounding. I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by. We made such advances. I don't understand half of them. There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
MARA: Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
KALEN: They're here! They're inside the house -- !
MARA: No, you're safe --
KALEN: They're inside --
MARA: Kalen, look at me. There's no one here but us. You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks. It was just a dream...
