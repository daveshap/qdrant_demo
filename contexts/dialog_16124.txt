COLLEEN: Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
SAM: Thanks, I'd like that. Thank you.
KURT: I'm surprised he hasn't left.
GEORGE: I haven't forced him to work. I only wet him down once. Why would he leave?
SAM: I'm leaving.
GEORGE: Hey...hey!
GEORGE: Where are you going?
SAM: I don't know.
GEORGE: When are you going to be back?
SAM: I don't know.
GEORGE: Well, until you know, you can't go.
SAM: Oh, okay.
