SMITH: Captain Miller, you copy?
MILLER: I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
SMITH: I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
MILLER: We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
SMITH: Understood.
MILLER: How is he?
DJ: His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
