"it gets better" is just bullshit that people say to make you feel better when they don't know what to say.
It doesn't get better. When it gets better, it gets even worse afterwards. Nothing good lasts forever. The bad wouldn't be bad without the good and vice versa. But the bad is just so, so fucking bad. I'm driven one step closer to suicide each time it gets bad, and my expectations on how bad it can get are subverted every time.
