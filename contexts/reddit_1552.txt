I am so stupid
Today I was looking over my Stanford essays to see if there were any I could potentially reuse. I made such a ridiculous mistake I swear to god. I was talking about my chickens and I used the word 'coup' instead of coop, so now what was supposed to be my chickens' cage or pen is now my chickens' sudden, violent, and illegal seizure of power from a government.

I'm dying.
