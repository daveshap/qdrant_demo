KEVIN: Hey, minuteman.
JIM: Shut up. You're supposed to be supportive.
OZ: You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
JIM: No. Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net. I don't think they liked it.
KEVIN: How do you know that?
JIM: She's already on a plane back home.
KEVIN: Yeah? Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
JIM: Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
