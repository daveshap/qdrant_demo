DICKIE: Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
RIPLEY: What club?
DICKIE: Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
RIPLEY: I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
FREDDIE: Dick -- you've got to hear this!
DICKIE: Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
