STEPHEN: ...Not now, Brian.
BRIAN: Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
STEPHEN: I had that fire. He didn't listen!
BRIAN: He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen. You burned him.
STEPHEN: Fuck you.
