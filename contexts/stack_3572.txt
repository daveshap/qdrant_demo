Storing RSA private/public key pairs in a file, on linux Would it be wise to:Generate a lot of priv./pub. key pairs, and store them in a file on the server machine(Linux). (Let's say in a companies server room)Then encrypt the file with AES, and store the AES key in server source code, directly.Then, when the server needs one random key pair, it decrypts the file, and takes a random pair.I know nothings always a 100% safe, butEDIT: The Server is local, while clients are remote. (over TCP)My question: Is this a more or less safe approach, and can someone steal/read the file somehow remotely, even tho I set the file permissions to my user only?
