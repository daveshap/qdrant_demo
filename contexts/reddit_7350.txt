I passed my OSHA exam with a 70% exact. Does my percentage matter to say other jobs/employers?
I'm not honestly sure how to feel about my passing of the exam. I want to feel proud but am disappointed with my score at 70% exact. I went on over a 6 hour streak today to get to the exam and finish it before returning back to work in the next few days. I spent 22.5 hours in total to get to the exam. I feel highly proud of how I did on the quizzes but the exam is what got to me. I got 70% for my first go at it but felt I could have got much better if I had either given myself a break from since waking up getting all the quizzes out the way or just not have rushed through it in a sense during the final exam. I wish I could re-take but hey, I'm just fucking glad I got it out the way at the least as I was told to have done before returning from break. It was a originally suppose to be an OSHA 10 hour General Industry but with my added electives and such, it came out to 17.5 hours estimate. All in all, over 22 hours it took. 


I just don't know if I should feel bad about it.
