DIRECTOR: Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
NORM: Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
PAUL: And another thing, where's that old mixer?
GRANDFATHER: Here, Pauly.
PAUL: Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
JOHN: Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
PAUL: What's old got to do with it?
JOHN: You needn't bother.
PAUL: Y'what?
JOHN: Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
PAUL: Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
JOHN: That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
JOHN: You see. You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
GRANDFATHER: But I'm clean.
NORM: I've got the stuff. Come here.
PAUL: Aren't we ...
NORM: No, we're not!
NORM: The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
JOHN: Tonight? We can't make it ...
NORM: You've got a midnight matinee.
JOHN: Now, look here, Norm ...
NORM: No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
JOHN: What?
NORM: You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
PAUL: Where's my grandfather?
NORM: Don't start. Look.
