Could organisms live in the rings in a planet? Think of Saturn.In this book, some people travel to a gas giant with rings and find an ecosystem in the rings of a planet. It has predators and prey. It has plants and animals. Autotrophs and Heterotrophs. Here are details of the organisms living here.Plants-they are Autotrophs-They absorb nutrients slowly from nearby rocks by roots. They anchor themselves to multiple rocks by a strong root system, they break occasiqnly.-They reproduce by extending roots to other rocks too. Like a quaking aspen.-They get energy from the nearby star.-They are adapted to low gravity, no atmosphere, low nutrients (high nutrient, including oxygen, in rocks).Animals-They Are Heterotrophs-They are adapted to low gravity, low nutrients, and no atmosphere.-They get all energy from plants and other animals.-They are adapted to jump to rock to rock.-Extremly strong exoskeleton to withstand the vacuum of space.-They communicate by vibrations through rocks, thus being on same rock to communicate.-Reproduce by laying eggs under rocks in asteroids.-They go around in packs.-Packs attack other packs.QuestionNow my question is with all their adaptations, could they even exist?
