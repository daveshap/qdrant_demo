I wish I died instead of my brother
It's really not fair. I've been wanting to die for years. My brother had everything. He was happy. He was a good man. He liked living. Then he died in a car crash. Why him? It should've been me.
I don't care about anything and I don't want anything. I'll never achieve anything. I don't have the motivation nor ambition. If I suicide my family will suffer too much, but at the same time I don't want to go on. I wish I could believe in destiny or paradise or greater meaning of everything, but Idk, it just seems like life keeps getting worse.
