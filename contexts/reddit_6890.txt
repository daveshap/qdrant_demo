Girlfriends job is asking her to resign while she's on medical leave.
My gf is a CNA and while she was at work a lot of her foot went numb and has been numb since. Her doctor told her not to return to work and gave her a medical note to give to her HR. Fast forward to this morning, HR calls back and straight up asks if "she can resign." My question is: Can they legally do this to her? And is there any legal recourse we can take against this? She would rather not lose her job since she needs it for income and depends on her employers day-care service. Any advice is appreciated.
