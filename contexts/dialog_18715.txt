EVELYN: Jonathan?
JONATHAN: Yes?
EVELYN: I think you found something.
EVELYN: See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it.
CURATOR: Perhaps.
JONATHAN: Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
EVELYN: He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
JONATHAN: Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
