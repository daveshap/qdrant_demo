My friend is flirting with me?
First time posting here, I guess I need your opinion cause I'm a bit confused of what to do.

(Sorry for the format, I'm in my phone)

Last Saturday I met a friend to spend the afternoon in a park, since we haven't seen each other for a few months (we're both 19 and going to college now). Everything was great, we caught up with our things, fooled around, then we lay down on the grass to listen to music. Then night came, I accompanied her to a fast food nearby so her parents could pick her up. They came and so our day ended.

So here's what happened that have me thinking till now:
When we were laying in the grass, she got a bit closer to me and asked about my previous relationships, like if I had a girlfriend, if I was talking to someone, if I got kissed in the last time, and this caught me completely out of guard. I answered and asked the same, then started to talk about her relationships, all of them a little bitter-sweet dramas. Then, she told me that she made out with a friend in a "steamy moment", all because she was feeling it.

She's a friend now, but she used to be my crush in high school, and I was wondering what could happen if I tell her this. What could happen if I kiss her without reason.

I know this is a long post, but I don't want those generic answers on Google.

tl:dr, I think a friend is flirting with me and I want to flirt back but dunno how
