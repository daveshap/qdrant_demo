STU: Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
DEATH: Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
STU: Back? You're sending me back?
DEATH: It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the Family Circus" guy instead."
STU: Death! Thank you!
DEATH: Thank me next time you see me.
