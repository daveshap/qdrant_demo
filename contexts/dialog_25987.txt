RACHEL: You're lying.
JACKIE: I lost him. I was panicked.
RACHEL: You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
JACKIE: I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off. Doing my imitation of you.
RACHEL: Ben never mentioned it.
JACKIE: He only remembers I <u>found</u> him. My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
JACKIE: Why didn't I?
RACHEL: Uh. You hate my guts?
