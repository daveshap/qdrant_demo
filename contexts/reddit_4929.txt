Stop telling me I cannot continue having a lazy life please.
I'll be honest, if you're sitting at home with no have school or a job because of depression, you'll get kinda used to the positive sides of it. And whereas I understand my parents' frustration that I haven't been doing anything for almost a year now, I can't take their rants at me anymore. I have not chosen for my life to be like this at only 21 years old. 

Anyway, perhaps I *am* to stubborn and lazy? Because I got used to it? My parents tell me I can't keep living like this till my 80th, and they're also not going to let me stay in the house for that long. It's not like they would kick me out very soon though, as my older sister moved out at 25 years old. Anyway, whereas I haven't been feeling miserable and really depressed for some months now, I still feel unhappy and I do get frustrated because I don't find purpose in my life. I still can't find hobbies or passions that I truly enjoy. I don't really have dreams either. And because of the fact I don't have much that makes me enjoy life, I don't feel like looking for a job because I know that won't make me appreciate life more. It would probably do the opposite instead.

I do feel a little bad about it, because it's kind of "obliged" to work, at least at some point. Everyone needs to work. Otherwise you can't make money, and without money you die. But I guess guilt is the major reason for me to feel bad for it. But the other part of me still thinks I haven't chosen to have been born or become depressed, and therefore I feel like it isn't fair that I owe society something. 

I think this is the end of my rant. I just don't know what to do or what to think about all this.

I'm sorry if I offended any people that are still in college or work despite their depression. That's not my intention.
