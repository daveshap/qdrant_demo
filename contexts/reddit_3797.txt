How do I break it off with a girl who was bigger than her photos after a good date? Feeling terrible...
So I was talking to a girl for a while now and we finally agreed to meet yesterday for drinks. As soon as I saw her I realised she used old photos and was clearly bigger than I was led to believe. We have a few drinks and after an awkward while it starts going ok, long story short we go back to hers but don't have sex. She was very quiet and is now talking about meeting her friends, which is too much for me, coupled with her bringing up her ex a lot.  I feel terrible though about it because we had a good time, but I didnt want to be an asshole on the date and not have a good time becaue of iy. Am I being unreasonable? I'm not free for a date this week so I have time to break it off ASAP. Any advice is appreciated. 

P.s. I feel like this should be an easy solve but its my first time doing this

Edit: thank you for all your help, I definitely went about the date wrong but it was an experience I can work on, you've really helped this overthinker!
