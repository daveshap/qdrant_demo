HAGEN: It's Michael's request...for your safety. We can send out for anything you need.
KAY: I'm supposed to stay in my house.
HAGEN: Within the compound will be fine.
KAY: I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
HAGEN: That's off now.
KAY: I'm going to see my parents.
HAGEN: Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat. But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
KAY: How long does this go on?
HAGEN: I don't know. I'm sorry, Kay...
KAY: Am I a prisoner?
HAGEN: That's not the way we look at it.
