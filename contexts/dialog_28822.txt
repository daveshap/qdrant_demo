GLASS: How long were you hooked?
REILLY: What?
GLASS: You don't have to talk about it.
REILLY: Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
GLASS: Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
REILLY: I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
GLASS: Your partner?
REILLY: I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
