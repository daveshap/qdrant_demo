I started subsiding my groceries by selling lunches at work
I’m not a crazy amazing chef or anything but I know my way around the kitchen and pack lunches every day (partly to save money, partly to eat better, partly to save time on lunch breaks). Coworkers have noticed my yummy lunches and now a few of them are purchasing lunches from me every week. It does take a little extra time in terms of meal prep but it sure helps bring down the grocery bill.

I know this might not be possible for everyone but if you’re already packing lunches for yourself it may be an option for you too!

Edit/clarification: a couple people have mentioned that it might attract legal and/or workplace trouble, but I’m not too worried because due to time constraints on my end it will never grow to anything bigger than a handful of people. As far as the company handbook goes I’m in the clear, but thanks for the concern!
