PRINCIPAL COLLINS: You had some questions.
JESSICA: Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
JESSICA: I don't know what you're talking about.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: Oh I think you do.
JESSICA: My parents are going to wonder where I am.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS: One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
