MR. EDDY: How ya doin', Pete?
PETE: Okay.
MR. EDDY: I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
MR. EDDY: Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this... ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
PETE: What?
MR. EDDY: I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
