What obligation do secret service, White House staff, etc have in terms of secrecy vs. reporting unethical/illegal behavior?
Surely, the president has a right to secrecy about personal matters but what if they witnessed a crime?  For example in the [article here] (https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-nato-commander-allies-wondering-if-trump-was-blackmailed-to-pull-troops-out-of-syria) it is alleged the president was blackmailed.  I thought for sure it was likely that someone else was always around like a guard, maid, translator or phone operator.  What would happen if something was observed?  I get that sort of thing could be subtle, but what if a US president actually did, for example personally perform an extra judicial killing and his body guard saw? Lips sealed or does he have an obligation to report?  Would he get in trouble either way from a legal perspective (additional extra judicial murder not withstanding)?  What do inner circle people have to protect the secrecy of versus a duty to report?
