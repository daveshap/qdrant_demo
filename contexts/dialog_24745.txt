DAVID LEE: From Miss Johnson --
NATHAN LEE: Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
DAVID LEE: Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my hello" to your family. Yours truly
NATHAN LEE: September 4 -- how far away is that?
