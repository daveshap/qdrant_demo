MCCLANE: Now help me out here, Doug. You were interested in a memory of...
QUAID: Mars.
MCCLANE: Right. Mars.
QUAID: That a problem?
MCCLANE: To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
QUAID: I'm not interested in Saturn. I said Mars.
MCCLANE: Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
MCCLANE: Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits. That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail. --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
QUAID: What's in the two week package?
MCCLANE: First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights: Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course... Venusville.
QUAID: How real does it seem?
MCCLANE: As real as any memory in your head.
QUAID: Come on, don't bullshit me.
MCCLANE: I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference. Guaranteed, or your money back.
QUAID: What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
MCCLANE: You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket. Look at the statistics.
