MA: Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
TOM: Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
MA: You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
