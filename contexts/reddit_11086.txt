This day last year, I rang a bell signifying the fact that chemotherapy is over.

Yes. Due to a certain asshole, I know some people won’t believe me, so I will attach photos of me. They  are taken off my parents Facebook. Also, due to phobias of being doxxed, if you want to see them please send me a message over DMs. I will send a dm with a link to see them. They will be slightly edited so  they cannot be traced back to me, but due to the amount of photos (and a modern day photo for you to compare too) I am hoping that it will be enough to prove that it is real. The imugur links no longer work. It is 11:30pm where I am, and I may stop responding soon, as it’s late. If I do go offline, I will be back to send DMs tomorrow sometime. 

You know what, screw it. Here is the Instagram. This post was deleted for weird reasons. If you wanna see the pics add me and in the morning (or afternoon- whenever I wake up) I will let you see them. It’s a private account. You won’t be able to see them before hand. I’m tired, it’s 12:28am and I don’t want people doubting me anymore [Instagram made for this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCPKqcTlo4ZLx-Shp6BB0tSzdB2S24v_mtBNag0/?igshid=1c9zkjo3pk32d). Goodnight. Love you all

March 28th 2017, a Tuesday. Diagnosed around 9:45pm

I was rushed to the hospital that day. I had blood taken, but my leukaemia was so bad, that the leukaemia made my spleen and liver swell, and push  up against my liver. I couldn’t eat. They could tell I had some sort of cancer after a 10 minute checkup.
[here is a photo of me that night, aged 12](https://imgur.com/gallery/LdPdoqV)

I begin treatment. I’m moved to a specialised hospital. I began 2 years and 4 months of chemotherapy. 

It was hard and sucked ass.

But on the 3rd of July, I took my last meds.

On the 4th july, I was officially signed off and rang my bell. I’m so excited and had to share it. I know you are all strangers but I kinda just want to tell the world. I wanna shout it out. I’m alive! I am proud. And I am happy. 

So whilst everyone eats hotdogs and watches the fireworks, I’ll be celebrating from the uk. Thanks dudes. :)

I will now input several pictures of me, just for proof. Gonna do this as that loser faked having cancer.

Also, if anyone wants to ask me questions, it may take me a while (I’m celebrating with my sisters) but I will try and get back to you guys. :))

Also, if anyone is still looking a this post (thanks) but I would like to mention a couple of charities which helped me, and won’t give away my location and address

Make a wish and CLIC saergent. If you can, please use the DreamLab app (it’s free). Or donate to a cause that means a lot to you. Donate to something you are passionate about, if you can afford to and want to. I don’t want awards. (Though I am genuinely really happy and thankful for anyone who even thought about giving me one). 

Even though I know That I’m real and I’m not faking and I’m just sharing something I’m proud of to the whole world, you can’t guarantee I’m real. That’s one thing that [redacted] taught us.

Enjoy your evenings. Love you all. :)

Edit 2: Hey guys, due to this post blowing up, and people being able to find my identity by reverse image searching, I am hiding all the images of myself. If anyone wants to see proof, I will send the photos to you privately. I’m sorry, I’m just getting a bit sick with worry that someone might do that. Thank you for understanding. If you do want proof I will Dm you privately to reduce the chance of this happening.
