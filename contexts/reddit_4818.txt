I never know what to say.
I wish that I was suicidal. I am not.

I am miserable and anxious.

The problem is ultimately my job but it is not something from which I can walk away.

&#x200B;

I do and I do not want to talk about it.

My life is terrible but all life is beutiful.

I hate poetry but this feels, at the very least lyrical.

&#x200B;

I am going to go hurt my blood sugar and then take my meds for the night.

I want to cry but my soul is too dehydrated.

I hate going to sleep because then I'll be that much closer to repeating it.

&#x200B;

Exhale.

Self-exhile.

Eat.
