VERGER: My encounter.
STARLING: <u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.
CORDELL: The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
VERGER: Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true. I offered the bounty. It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder. Do you Agent Starling: do you know <u>God</u>?
STARLING: ...sir...?
VERGER: Isn't it funny? You can look on my face which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me. Which shows a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong strong convictions. But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
