We don't deserve this.
None of us do, what we deal with daily is a living hell, and we just don't deserve it at all. It's hard living like this, unbearably hard but let's not forget that we're so strong and resilient for fighting it daily. Some people might wave us off and disregard how we feel with comments like "just relax, it's not even that bad, you're just overreacting." but that's bullshit. I know how it is, we all do, and I want you all to know I'm proud of you, you woke up today and you faced anxiety head on, you did a thing, be it small or big you tackled today's tasks and you didn't crumble under anxiety. You're improving, you're doing better bit by bit, and I know how hard that is. So if no one else will tell you, I will, I'm proud of you and you're doing damn good. It might take a long time but I know each and every one of us can overcome this, it might take longer for some of us, but we'll do it. So just keep tackling it day by day, we're stronger than this, we never asked for this, we never once did anything to deserve this, but I know we'll beat it. Stay strong, I love all of you.
