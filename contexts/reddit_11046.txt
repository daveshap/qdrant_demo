I just woke up to my mom sitting in the chair next to my bed LOOKING through my phone
I asked her why she was doing this

"I'm your mother"

I said, "If I was doing this i would get grounded."

"Yep."

"Do I not have privacy?"

What she said next phisically pains me

&#x200B;

"Well, I'm sitting here next to you waiting for you to wake up with nothing to do, so I was bored."

"Why were you waiting?"

"you have schoolwork and I want you to get started on it"

"Then tell me to get started on it and don't look through my stuff!"

&#x200B;

I don't know how long she was there, or what she looked through, but damn, really?

&#x200B;

Edit: Yes I have a password. I'm not *THAT* stupid. Somehow she figured it out and here we are.

Edit 2: To all the people saying "Well, you don't pay for it, so screw you."

That's akin to saying, "Do you pay for the house? No. So take the door off the bathroom."

Edit 3: There's a bunch of people saying that I should be happy I have a phone. I am. 100%. The problem I have is that we're all entitled to privacy (even my fucking mother) no matter if it's online, offline, inline, outline. Privacy is a right, not a privilege. Nobody likes a constant helicopter.

&#x200B;

Edit 4: Jesus, a lot of people are like, "Well you're the idiot for not having a secure password, you deserved it. I didn't set the password. My dad did. I haven't had a problem until now. I should have reset it but didn't because of lack of issue.

&#x200B;

Edit 5: Let me clear a lot of the main arguments up.

If you are worried about your child's safety then absolutely you can go through it. If there's no cause for alarm, and you happen to be, oh, I don't know, bored waiting for your kid to wake up, then that's just an invasion.

&#x200B;

Sure, I may sound like an entitled brat, but if there's a line that one cannot cross, why should the other be able to cross it ?

&#x200B;

Yeah, I live under Mom's roof. That doesn't mean that if i'm asleep and she's bored she can look through my stuff.

&#x200B;

The phone WAS a gift, meaning she wanted me to have it to do as I please. Again, if there's reason, go ahead, ask to look. She gave me it accepting that risk of me having free will with it. It's a stupid argument when you say that she payed for it, so I can't have a normal human right. If you give a kid a hot wheels car, then forbid him from using it because he didn't pay one dollar to have it, that's pretty shitty.

&#x200B;

I REALLY want my own phone plan and yet I don't get an allowance and can't travel anywhere as it is. I guess I could skateboard or bike to wal-mart, but she'd get suspicious and shut it down.

&#x200B;

If you ask to go through it, go right ahead. If there's a suspicion, go right ahead. Don't do it during a kid's sleep.

&#x200B;

There's a lot of boomers, and they have like 3 arguments. Hope i cleared that up so that my inbox isn't as full as it is. I would appreciate if you checked if your question has already been asked, because I can't get to half the people.
