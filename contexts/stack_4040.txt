Refund for Flight Cancellation - SATA Many months ago, SATA (now known as Azores Airlines) canceled a flight from the Azores to Boston on which my wife and I had confirmed passage. EU regulations are clear that under the circumstances which obtained, we were owed financial compensation. I wrote to the carrier providing all details and citing regulations, but have received only automated replies to my original message and numerous follow-ups. Anyone have relevant experience? What's the best way to contact the EU regulators?
