MCCLANE: Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me. Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me. She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry. You get all that?
POWELL: I got it. But you can tell her yourself. Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
MCCLANE: I hope so. But that's up to the guy upstairs. Upstairs... ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
POWELL: Roy?
MCCLANE: Stand by, Powell. I gotta check something out.
