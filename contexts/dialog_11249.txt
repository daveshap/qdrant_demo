KIP: Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
MEMPHIS: How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
KIP: After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
MEMPHIS: Thank-you ...
KIP: De nada ...
MEMPHIS: Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
KIP: The family that steals together, deals together...
MEMPHIS: Dad'd be proud --
KIP: Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
MEMPHIS: What era was that -- ?
KIP: The era when crime didn't pay --
MEMPHIS: As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
KIP: Price of doing business...
MEMPHIS: What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
KIP: It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis. You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say paper or plastic?""
