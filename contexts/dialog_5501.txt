THEO: Can I make a quick call?
TRUCKER: Government business?
THEO: Very official. 259-7881, if I recall.
NELSON: Yeah?
THEO: Nels! Guess who? A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
NELSON: Who's this?
THEO: I thought you'd know me by now.
NELSON: What does it take to kill you?
THEO: I suppose you're in your taxi?
NELSON: Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
THEO: Intelligent question, Nels. I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
NELSON: That bitch. What's keeping you from taking off?
THEO: My compensation! Somebody still owes me -- big time!
TRUCKER: What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
THEO: Undercover.
TRUCKER: I thought so.
THEO: Your partners are currently armed and we're not. Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
NELSON: I can see the benefit in that.
THEO: You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
NELSON: Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds. I may need to pry that information out of her. What do you stand to gain?
THEO: Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
TRUCKER: The 405 is coming up.
THEO: Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
NELSON: In the hills above Sunset. Just below the Getty.
THEO: Take the 405 south.
THEO: How far off are you?
NELSON: Five minutes.
THEO: Where do I turn?
NELSON: Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco. It'll be a narrow winding road. You can't miss the house. It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
THEO: Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
NELSON: And make ourselves a hell of a target.
THEO: We're gonna get there first.
NELSON: How do you know?
THEO: Believe me. They couldn't be busier at the moment.
