Windows virtual machine for Mac students to share I am a teacher in a Windows-supported college university, where we use a lot of software that only runs on Windows computers. We would like to help our Mac students by providing them with an easy-to-use and easy-to-transfer way to run Windows as a virtual machine, preferably without to need to install or configure a lot of software for the student.Does somebody have an idea of a way in which we can create and configure a virtual machine and provide it to the students for simple use?
