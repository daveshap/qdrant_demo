TAUPIN: The emptyness. The years and years of void. Nothingness. Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
BRENNA: The inheritance.
TAUPIN: Not power. Not control.
TAUPIN: Life. It is the gift and the under- standing of life.
BRENNA: You have lived forever.
TAUPIN: Life is only life when it is bounded by death. The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric. The inside. I love you Brenna.
TAUPIN: It will be horrible. The future. I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing. Nothing but a moment. Maybe two. But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
BRENNA: Yes.
