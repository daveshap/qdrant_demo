“You’re not alone.” Yes, the fuck I am.
It’s me vs world, it’s always been me vs the world and no matter how many times random ass people post shit on like instagram about how “You’re not alone!” “You’re gonna be okay!” it will never be true. I am alone and I will make the decision to eat lead alone, I will die and rot alone just as a lived because that’s the sad reality for some people. Some people have people, some do not and that’s just how it is.
