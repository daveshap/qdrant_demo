BETTY: I don't believe it. I'm winning.
VERONICA: Don't get cocky, girl.
BETTY: I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
VERONICA: That's bullshit. Just shoot.
BETTY: Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
VERONICA: Shoot.
VERONICA: Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
BETTY: Ronnie!
BETTY: Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
VERONICA: It's not my style, okay?
BETTY: Nice guys finish last. I should know.
