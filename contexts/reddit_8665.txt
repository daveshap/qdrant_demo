Are there any contingencies in place if the President of the U.S. makes false statements and/or spreads false information? Can a president or their administration be held accountable for making false statements and claiming them to be true?
One thing politicians and their staff have always been famous for is spinning news. It's definitely not unheard of and it will always be a part of politics and news. But under this new administration, it seems that they are not spinning news, they are making [false statements and claiming](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/01/22/opinions/alternative-facts-lies-obeidallah-opinion/index.html) them to be true. 

While I find lying about the actual size of President Trump inauguration to be a small issue, it makes me wonder, what is to stop him or his administration from lying about other issues facing this country. What is to stop them from making false statements and spreading them as truth? It seems that currently President Trump and his administration can make any [claims](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/politics/trump-white-house-briefing-inauguration-crowd-size.amp.html) they want, and all the media can do is report on it. Any info would on this matter would be much appreciated. Thank you.
