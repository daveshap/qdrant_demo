How does exotic weapon quest scaling work? So after doing the campaign, there are a number of quests that reward exotic weapons (MIDA Multi-Tool, Sturm, Rat King). I've noticed that these rewards scale to your power level to some extent after I got a 280 Sturm on one character and a 294 Sturm on another. Is there a hard and fast rule to see how powerful your quest reward is going to be or is it more RNG-based?
