BOBBY: Maybe I do.
BLIND MAN: Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
BOBBY: I think I've heard that before.
BLIND MAN: What do you want for free?
BOBBY: You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
BLIND MAN: Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
BOBBY: What?
BLIND MAN: ...And everything is nothing too.
