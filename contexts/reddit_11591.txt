Girlfriend of 3 and a half years doesn't love me anymore
The other day my girlfriend of 3 and half years and who I was planning to marry told me she doesn't love me anymore. Today she posted a Snapchat story of her with her ex calling him cute. Everything seemed fine before this and it just came out of no where. I feel so lost and betrayed and hurt. I dont know what to do or how to handle this. She lives with my grandma and is supposedly moving out and we have a phone plan together I just don't know what to do now.
