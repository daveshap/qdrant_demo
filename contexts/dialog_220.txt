BOWMAN: I suppose the idea was specialized training.
POOLE: I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
BOWMAN: Oh?
POOLE: Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
BOWMAN: No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
POOLE: Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
C12: CONTINUED
BOWMAN: Well, what is it?
POOLE: I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
BOWMAN: That seems very unlikely.
POOLE: Yes, I thought so.
BOWMAN: Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
POOLE: How?
BOWMAN: Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
POOLE: That's true.
C12: CONINUED
BOWMAN: Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
