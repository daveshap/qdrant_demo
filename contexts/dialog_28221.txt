MAN: I don't agree. Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
JEANNE: Why are you doing this to me?? Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
MAN: Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define. When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
JEANNE: I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
MAN: Really?
