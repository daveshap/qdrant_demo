I feel like no one will take me seriously because I’m not suicidal.
A little backstory:
I’m 16 years old and have clinical depression and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). I also might have OCD. Both my parents have chronic illnesses that made high school difficult, so I put in a lot of work and graduated early. In this process I lost most of my friends and I now have nothing to do with my time. I was struggling when I was in school, but it was at least a distraction. 

Now after several failed attempts at trying medications prescribed by my gp I’m waiting to see a psychiatrist for a med change. I’m also not in therapy anymore because my therapist left to join another field of work. 

I feel so helpless and alone and I anguish in the pain of my anxiety ridden mind every second of every day. But it’s like I’ve been put in limbo. Just waiting for the next appointment, where they’ll refer me to someone else who I’ll have to wait another month to see. 
 
All of this waiting is because I’m terrified of dying or getting hurt so I could never self harm or be suicidal. This makes people not see me as a priority. But I need help and I need it now. I feel like I lose my mind a little more everyday. I feel lost in self loathing and disappointment because I can never do what I want or need to do. And I’m so very exhausted. I lay awake at night scared of everything from inadvertently starting a fire and killing my family, to being killed by a home intruder. I can’t take it anymore but still I have to wait just because I’m not “a threat to myself or others”. 

Anyone else feel the same? Cause I feel like I’m alone on this.
