It paid off.
It finally paid off.

Foregoing the fun Friday nights.

Not spending my salary on a new vehicle.

It all paid off.

Me and my girlfriend can afford our normal lifestyle for a year. No matter what happens. A year. I haven't been laid off, but if it does happen we're okay. I'm so proud of us, even though it took sacrifice. We're not scrambling to figure out "what next?", because we budgeted and planned for this.

*EDIT* Below I have included financial information. A recent job change has possibly made me not "poverty" level anymore. If so, I will remove my post. I dont want this to be a "pat me on the back", and would like to share how we have prepped for the "apocalypse".

Financial Information:
Job: Inside sales. (27K base, extra 13K if quota is reached)

Previous Employment: Truck unloader

Education: Bachelor's in Business Administration (cheapest state school I could find. Had one scholarship).

Current Debt: 16.5K (All Student Loans).

Rent $736 a month

All Bills: Approx. $200 a month. The season is a factor.

How we did it:
Canned foods, Intermittent fasting to put us at 2 meals max. Paid off my vehicle with double employment. Cheap meals where leftovers gave us 2-3 meals a week. Light prepping in the pantry, so we wouldn't have to shop if something kept us in. MOST IMPORTANT: Odd Jobs. I made some very decent money on ranches, and farms. Hard work but it paid. In some cases I lived on the ranch, did work, left for my evening job, then woke up to do it again. It was how I paid for my car, and a chunk of my education.

Sorry if the salary no longer makes me poverty. It was a pretty recent promotion.
