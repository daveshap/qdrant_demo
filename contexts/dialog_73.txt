KAT: Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
BIANCA: Like you care.
KAT: I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
BIANCA: I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
KAT: Joey never told you we went out, did he?
BIANCA: What?
KAT: In 9th. For a month
BIANCA: Why?
KAT: He was, like, a total babe
BIANCA: But you hate Joey
KAT: Now I do. Back then, was a different story.
BIANCA: As in...
KAT: He said everyone was doing it. So I did it.
BIANCA: You did what?
KAT: Just once. Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore. I wasn't ready. He got pissed. Then he broke up with me.
BIANCA: But
KAT: After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because everyone else" was doing it. And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party
BIANCA: Why didn't you tell me?
KAT: I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
BIANCA: No. you didn't! If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
KAT: That's not
BIANCA: I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
KAT: I guess I thought I was protecting you.
BIANCA: God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
KAT: Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
BIANCA: I guess I'll never know, will I?
