WilliamTheReader: What Your Essay Looks Like From the Other Side + Crucial Essay Advice
Hi guys, first some housekeeping. I hit the 1,000 essays reviewed mark a week ago and am now closer to 1,200. **Definitely send me essays through direct chat**. We tried messages and I just can't make sure I get everyone in my inbox. Also, I am trying to get to everyone but I really underestimated the response from everyone. Sorry if I missed you, just direct chat me. I'm trying to juggle full-time work and also the wonderful clients that hired me privately for admissions consulting (who I've really been focusing on).

I have realized something. **Many of you have been really overrating the quality of your essays, or you just have no idea what top colleges are looking for**. This is concerning to say the least. So, as the deadlines are approaching, I want to give some insight on how essays are actually evaluated. This is critical advice that I'm not seeing anywhere else on the internet, and it comes mostly from my experiences on the other side of the table as an AO. **The main takeaway is that essays are the single most important factor on your application,** excluding outside factors you can't control (race, HS, hooks etc.)

&#x200B;

The first thing you have to understand is that there is only one universal goal that a top admissions essay has to accomplish: to make the AO like and root for you on a personal level. No other universal rules exist. That is the only guiding principle, everything else is dependent on the AO that reads your app. Think about it from our perspective. First, we need to get all the "required" kids in. So immediately, 30-40% of our class is filled from all the athletes/special kids/legacies/feeder school kids. You could argue that URMs have their own quotas as well. Once we have those, there is no reason to take applicant A over applicant B. Sure, we need to maintain high SAT scores, but beyond that there really isn't any requirement we're worried about. If I reject the 36 ACT 4.0 superstar, I lose nothing. If I accept him/her, I gain nothing. This is dangerous, because now we have a wealth of kids to pick from whose fate affects us in no way.

*It's January 2nd, 2019 and I'm starting to read applications. I'm going through the applications for my region and read Applicant A. He's a USAMO qualifier, he tutors at-risk kids, he is captain of his state championship debate team. But he writes a really sort of average common app essay. Well my enthusiasm for him is only going to be so-so not because I choose not to be, but because I genuinely don't remember anything about him ten applications later. But, he still gets to make it through to the next round because his accomplishments are really strong and he scored a 35 / 3.95 UW.*

&#x200B;

*So his application comes up in committee. I, as his regional counselor, am responsible for pitching him. I stand up and tell my colleagues about this academic superstar, accomplished leader in his community, family oriented role model. I then explain his common app essay. I say all of this in sort of a matter-of-fact prose style. I try to be enthusiastic but faking it is hard. I get no reaction from the rest of my colleagues because 1) I personally am not enthused by the essay, and my lack of enthusiasm is very apparent and 2) his common app objectively sounds generic. Well, none of my colleagues are going to throw their weight for a kid who I myself am not crazy about. Also, nobody gets fired if we reject this superstar. We vote. He gets half yes's and half no's and he ends up in the deferred/waitlist/rejected pile. I don't personally care about this applicant, so I don't vote to appeal his case in the next round (which is something AOs do if they really love a kid that gets voted down).*

&#x200B;

*Then, I pull up the next applicant file. Applicant B, a girl with lower scores and worse ECs than Applicant A. I visibly get excited, as I had been anticipating this profile all day. This excitement translates immediately to my colleagues indirectly (as any room of people would) and the intrigue starts to build. They're wondering, what's got WilliamTheReader so excited? I tell this story about this sort of average, haven't done anything noteworthy applicant. I have an outline for what I'll say because I've been thinking about this particular case for a while. I describe the common app essay and how it made me personally feel, and even quote one of the more profound lines in her conclusion. Her supplements are well crafted, vibrant, and create a full picture of her. Everyone in the room can tell how passionate I am about this girl, and since I work with them everyday and there's some level of respect/office politics going on nobody thinks it's worth it to fight against me. We're all veterans, and the first rule you learn about committee is to pick your battles. We vote and she thus gets 0 no's (and therefore all yes's), and she gets the acceptance*.

&#x200B;

This sequence of events has happened multiple times every single day of committee, for every admissions office at every elite school in the country, for the past 20-30 years. As you can see, a bad pitch can ruin a good application, but a good pitch can really make the difference for a so-so application. **Average essays ruin top applications, strong essays boost average applications.**

Hope this was helpful, and good luck everyone!
