Anyone else with "high functioning" anxiety?
Don't mean to rank forms of anxiety, which is why I used the scare quotes - 

I saw three or four therapists who told me, "wow, sounds like you're doing really well!" before seeing one who took my anxiety seriously. I'm always early to things, I'm an "exceeds expectations" performer at my job, recently finished grad school with a solid GPA, have a great relationship with my significant other and my family, and I just feel all kinds of BAD most of the time.

Anyway, CBT didn't work super well and as nice as my therapist was, they were too expensive/didn't take insurance, so I'm just managing by myself. It's not going super well.

Anyone else in a similar boat? What are you doing that helps you feel better? Since finishing grad school, I plan to try and find a treatment plan depending on my PCP's recommendations.

Thank you <3
