DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE: No last names, Jonah. Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers. How come you're up so late?
JONAH: It's not that late in Seattle.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE: Got me there. What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
JONAH: It's not for me. It's for my dad. I think he needs a new wife.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE: You don't like the one he was now?
JONAH: He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE: Where's your mom?
JONAH: She died.
