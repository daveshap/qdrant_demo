My brother's leaving me.
My brother is leaving in less than a month. He's leaving for Seattle so that he can be away from my family and be with a girl. I don't know what to do because he doesn't know how much he means to me. I need him around. I don't know how to tell him that I need him to stay because I don't want to seem selfish... I want him to be happy and live his own life... But I don't know what I'll do without him...
