KAREN: I'll send it to you at Glades.
GLENN: Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
FOLEY: Take your sunglasses off.
GLENN: I see better with them on.
FOLEY: You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
FOLEY: Wait in the car.
GLENN: You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
FOLEY: I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that? Take her with you and put her in back.
GLENN: In the trunk?
FOLEY: The backseat.
