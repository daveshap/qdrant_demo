TREVOR: So you're just packing it up just like that?
BRET: Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
TREVOR: Yeah? You and who else?
BRET: Someone special.
