Why does Easter appear so early in the TV series? In American Gods (book), the character of Easter appears only a couple of times in the story: once when Wednesday is trying to recruit her, and then (if I recall correctly) later on to<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   take Shadow down from the tree where he's been hanging.</blockquote>In American Gods (TV show), Easter appears much sooner in the story - at the end of the first season, which corresponds to a much earlier point in the novel than her first appearance there. Although she's only been in one episode so far, it seems like she's set to play a much more major role in the TV show than the novel.Why was her character expanded, and brought forward, so much?Whose decision was it? Gaiman? Green and Fuller? Someone else?Has anyone spoken about the reason for it, e.g. in interviews? Was it to show off Kristin Chenoweth and her acting ability as soon and as much as possible? Did they feel that Easter was an underused character and should be expanded, a la Mad Sweeney and Salim?
