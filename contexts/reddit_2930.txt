Feeling overwhelmed at work and actually broke down in public today - What should I do?
Hi everyone,

Posting here because I don't know where else to go, and I'm too embarrassed to tell the full story to my family and friends.

I recently started a new job after graduation, and it's been about 3 months. Yet things don't seem to be getting better.... I'm just getting so tired. I bring my work home almost every day, and even then, it seems like I'm still not finishing fast enough.

They say the team you work with makes a hell of a difference - thats definitely true. I have an amazing team, but a manager who's a lot more particular and brutally straightforward about it..... it's been a bit harder in that aspect. I feel like I've fucked up, almost every single day. Every day there's a new crisis, even over the weekends because everyone still actively emails over the weekend.... I couldn't take it. Broke down at the dinner table today in front of my boyfriend's family after half a day of replying nasty emails and I'm utterly mortified.

Has anyone else here faced a similar situation? Did you stick it out, or find someplace better? Today was the first time in this three months that I've genuinely considered applying somewhere else.... I don't know anymore.
