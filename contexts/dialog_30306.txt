MIDGE: Easy, now.
SCOTTIE: This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
MIDGE: Johnny!
SCOTTIE: Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
SCOTTIE: How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
ELSTER: I married into it.
SCOTTIE: Interesting business.
ELSTER: No, to be honest, I find it dull.
SCOTTIE: You don't have to do it for a living.
ELSTER: No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
SCOTTIE: How long have you been back?
ELSTER: Almost a year.
SCOTTIE: And you like it.
ELSTER: San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
SCOTTIE: Like all this.
ELSTER: I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power... the freedom.
ELSTER: Shouldn't you be sitting down?
SCOTTIE: No, I'm all right.
ELSTER: I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers. And you've quit the force. A permanent physical disability?
SCOTTIE: No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But -- -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
ELSTER: Would you like a drink now?
SCOTTIE: No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits. Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business. What's on your mind
