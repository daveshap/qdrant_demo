Lost my job and didn't get my dream job.
In August I lost my job, what made it even better is I lost it right between my birthday and my wedding day.

I have always loved technology and repairing computers. I found out recently there is a company in town that repairs PCs, sells them, and sets up/does maintenance on networks. This right here has always been my dream job. 

About 2 weeks ago I had an interview. The owner seemed to like me and said he wanted to run the ad for 2 more weeks to see what he gets. So, being the diligent person I am I wait the two weeks and email them for an update.

He gets back to me saying he has considered all sorts of things but hasn't really made a final decision yet. I just email him and say that's fine I understand and that I'll get in touch with him at a later date.

Later that evening I get an email from him saying that he wants me to have lunch with one of his associates on Friday(today). This gets me excited as I also noticed that the ad had been taken down. 

I meet up with the manager for lunch and we have a conversation. Everything seems to be going well and he says they'll be in touch. About two hours after that I send a thank you email to both the owner and the manager. Soon after that I get an email stating while they liked me, they decided that they weren't going to hire me at this time.

It has just devastated me. It seemed like I was getting all of these signs that everything was going to work out only to be shot down. Sorry to ramble on a bit and if you did take the time to read this thank you. I hope your day has been better than mine.

**TL;DR Lost job at inconvenient time. Interviewed several times for a company I really want to work for but didn't get the job.**
