(20F) guy is kind of out of my league but he’s so handsome, should I shoot my shot anyway?
I’m not super unattractive, tbh I would say the only thing in my opinion that makes me unattractive is my weight, I’m tall so my weight proportions good so I don’t look really big I’m just average. anyway I kind of talked to him on accident and he’s really chill and seems really sweet, I noticed him immediately when I first saw and he’s super handsome but not someone I feel would give me the time of day because normally that’s what people think when someone is more attractive than them. should I shoot my shot anyway?
