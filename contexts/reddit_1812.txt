Michigan broke my damn heart...
Michigan sent me the email to get my free Class of 2024 t shirt. 👀👀👀👀 

Being a man who likes t shirts, I couldn't resist. 🤠🤠🤠🤠 

2 days after I ordered it, I withdrew to go somewhere else. 🤪🤪🤪🤪 

The next day, they sent me the UPS tracking email. 😳😳😳😳 

It arrived today. Just the bag. Opened. No t shirt. 😦😦😦😦 

This hurts worse than a rejection letter. 😔😔😔😔

I'm sending back the bag. 😎😎😎😎
