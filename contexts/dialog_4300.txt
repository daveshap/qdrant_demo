DULANEY: What do you have in your purse?
JOANNE: What do you think I've got? A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too. Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
JOANNE: I'm gonna go to jail. I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
DULANEY: Why'd you come here?
JOANNE: To show you this. It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler. He wrote it to me the day after I saw him. He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
DULANEY: You didn't know about it before that?
JOANNE: No.
DULANEY: Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
JOANNE: Because he called me.
DULANEY: Hi, Joe.
KOEHLER: Frank -- what are you doing here?
DULANEY: I need to ask you a question. What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
KOEHLER: You know I can't talk about that.
DULANEY: I'm not asking for names or specifics. I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
KOEHLER: Sorry.
