Laid off or fired?
A few years ago I worked for a Kumon tutoring center for my first job. My ninth or so month there (during the summer), my boss told me that since the place wasn't as busy at the time, I wouldn't have to come into my work days until later. After that month, she told me that the place wasn't busy enough to really need me, so I didn't have to come in unless she emailed me. Summer ended, school started again, and she never emailed me.

Would this be considered me getting laid off or fired (or something else)? Looking back on it I should have paid attention to see whether or not the place was really less busy than before, but I didn't, so I have no idea. I'm asking now because I'm applying for a new job and it's asking about previous employment.
