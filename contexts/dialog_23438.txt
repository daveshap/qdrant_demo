GRAHAM: Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
ANN: I feel like they do.
GRAHAM: Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
GRAHAM: I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
ANN: Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
ANN: Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
GRAHAM: It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
ANN: Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do. I'm getting confused.
ANN: Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
GRAHAM: I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
ANN: Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
GRAHAM: So what about kids?
ANN: Kids? What about them?
GRAHAM: Do you want them?
ANN: Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
GRAHAM: Why is that?
ANN: I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
ANN: So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
GRAHAM: Do you want me to?
ANN: As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
GRAHAM: Agreed.
