TREVOR: The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
BRET: Yeah, how's that?
TREVOR: I have my connections
BRET: Really? Do tell.
TREVOR: Gwen.
BRET: GWEN?
TREVOR: I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
BRET: You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
TREVOR: Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
