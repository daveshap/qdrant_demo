some of y'all need a reality check
not to @ anyone but in general, ive seen so many posts like "will getting a B make colleges rescind me?" "i got a B for the first time, will xyz university reject me?"

a single B will not be the reason why a college rejects you and definitely not why they rescind you. you'd have to fail several classes to be rescinded. i get the anxiety, but posts like that are distasteful. so take one second to think: am i overreacting because of my high standards or could this pose a legitimate issue?

i know it's been drilled into some of our brains that Bs aren't good, but that's not true. especially not in an ap class lol. having that mentality is gonna cause you so much pain and unnecessary stress, trust me. perfectionism is a bitch.
