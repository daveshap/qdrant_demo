In the midst of possible mass layoff at my job. What can I do?
Don't know if this is allowed here. If not, please direct me where this case could be answered better. Also on mobile so excuse any errors. I currently work at a tire house in VA. Friday afternoon, a letter was posted saying all employees are required to be present for a training day on sunday. This is the one day of the week we are never scheduled to work. We all fall under full time work so I'm not sure how this works. Many of us, including me said we wouldn't be coming in, but were told it's mandatory. At the end of the letter it said "there are no exceptions to missing this training". Is it legal to require employees to be at work on a non scheduled day with so little advance warning? We are under the assumption this it to discipline/terminate anyone who doesn't show up. Do I have a case with the labor board if there is a mass firing? Any advice in this case would be appreciated.
