What are the consequences of the recent Italian election and the causes of the change in electoral makeup?
Yesterday on March 4th, the [Italian 2018 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_general_election,_2018) was held to elect the 630 members of the Chamber of Deputies and the 315 members of the Senate. 

BBC has a good graphic for the positions of the factions/parties on the main issues of the election: [Graphic](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/E3D8/production/_100282385_italy_where_they_stand-nc.png), [Source article](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43291390)

The [results](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/mar/05/italian-elections-2018-full-results-renzi-berlusconi) showed M5S taking the lead as the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, a historic change. M5S got 32.22%, PD got 18.9%, Lega Nord got 17.69%, FI got 13.94%, meaning that the center-right group got around 31.7%. The center-right faction and center-left factions got slightly more than their totals currently because they are allied with groups of smaller parties. Overall, the results [showed](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/secondary/italian-election-2018-results-map-who-won-Italy-election-latest-1256263.jpg) ([source article](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/927272/italian-election-2018-results-map-who-won-Italy-election-latest)) the center-right faction as the largest faction with 37.00%, 5SM with 32.31%. 

This is a historic win of the anti-establishment over the establishment, and has many implications for Italy. 

• What was the cause of the shift towards the populist Five Star Movement?

• How much of an effect did party positions on immigration and the European Union have on the results?

• What statements have been made about possible coalitions by the relevant parties?

__**Background**__  
The election took place under a complex combination of FPTP, MMP and PR - First Past The Post, Mixed-Member Proportional and Proportional Representation, after being set in place by the [2016 Italian Constitutional Referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_constitutional_referendum,_2016). [This article written before the election](http://www.businessinsider.fr/uk/italy-election-2018-what-you-need-to-know-2018-2) goes over the electoral system, the emergence of the Five Star Movement and predictions.


Main coalitions:

The center-left coalition is primarily made up of the Democratic Party (PD), but also includes More Europe (+E), Together (I), Popular Civic List (CP), SVP-PATT, and Aosta Valley (VdA)

The center-right coalition is primarily made up of League/Lega Nord (L), Forza Italia (FI), but also includes the Brothers of Italy (FdI), and Us with Italy (NcI). 

The main parties in the election were:  

• [Democratic Party (PD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(Italy\)): A center-left party devoted to social democracy and social liberalism. The party is a result of the merger of numerous center-left parties, and has been in power since 2013.   

• [League (L)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord): League, or Lega Nord, is a regional right-wing political party advocating populism, federalism and is a strong opponent of globalization, immigration and a soft Euroskeptic party.   

• [Forza Italia (FI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Italia_\(2013\)): Forza Italia, or Forward Italy, is a center-right coalition based upon Christian democracy and liberal conservatism.   

• [Five Star Movement (5SM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Star_Movement): Five Star Movement is an anti-establishment party coalition with various principles and many factions: environmentalism, anti-globalization, Euroskepticism, populism, direct democracy are some of its core ideals. There has been ambiguity around the party's position on immigration, Grillo (the party's founder) [advocating](http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2016/12/23/grillo-calls-for-mass-deportations-2_c2583737-0f97-4157-a2f3-d2a9137728b6.html) for the expulsion of all illegal immigrants from Italy, but there is no official position. 

The polling had shown a decline in the center-left coalition share of the vote and an increase of the 5SM share of the vote, with the center-right share of the vote remaining fairly static.
