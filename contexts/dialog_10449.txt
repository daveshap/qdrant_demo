WASHINGTON: Colonel Reed...
JOSEPH REED: George! So good to be back!
JOSEPH REED: That damned Arnold is here, isn't he? Did you know he lost all his ships? Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
WASHINGTON: Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges. In my opinion he saved my army.
JOSEPH REED: Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man.
