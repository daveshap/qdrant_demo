ALFRED: What seems to be the problem?
BRUCE: Women.

BRUCE: First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me. Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
ALFRED: Specify, please.
BRUCE: Pamela Isley. I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly. I still can't. She used to work for Wayne Enterprises. Find a file.
ALFRED: Coming on line now, sir.
