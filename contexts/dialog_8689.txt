JOEL: I don't know. What if it breaks?
CLEMENTINE: What if?
JOEL: I think I should go back.
CLEMENTINE: Joel, come here. Please.
JOEL: Listen, did you want to make love?
CLEMENTINE: Make love?
JOEL: Have sex. Y'know --
CLEMENTINE: Oh, um...
JOEL: Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
CLEMENTINE: That's okay. I --
JOEL: I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
CLEMENTINE: Hey, Joel --
JOEL: -- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
CLEMENTINE: I'm nervous, too.
JOEL: Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
CLEMENTINE: Well, you obviously don't know me.
JOEL: I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
