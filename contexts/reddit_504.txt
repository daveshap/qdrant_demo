I need help
Hey so I got a big crush on my female bestie but can't say this to her because I fear I might lose her. She is in love with already with another guy but it's killing me seeing her with him and she only talks about him everytime we get together. She knows that I have a crush on her.. We have been together like for 2yrs.. And after March she is going abroad for higher studies.. She makes me a better person when she is near me.. And I like it.. What do i do???
