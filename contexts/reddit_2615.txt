People with 2 jobs. Are you constantly tired or have you managed to make it work?
I’m thinking about getting a second job but I don’t know if I’ll always be exhausted. Do you think working from 11pm-7am and then a different job from 8am-4pm appropriately 5 days a week is unreasonable?

Update: Thanks for all the responses everyone! I appreciate hearing about your experiences. The majority consensus I’ve gained from you is 2 back to back full time jobs aren’t a good idea.

Also a few of you have asked, the reason I want a second is money. My current job is horrible pay but it’s good experience for my degree. So I’m looking for a second job in any field. I’m not struggling right now but I’m in my 20s still living with my parents, I want to save enough money to get my own apartment already.
