GOOSE: But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
STINGER: Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
GOOSE: Mav's a great flyer but....
STINGER: He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing. He just can't seem to follow orders!
STINGER: You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
MAVERICK: Sir?
STINGER: That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
MAVERICK: Yes sir!
