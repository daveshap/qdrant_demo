What, if any, is the "free market" solution to the increase of drug/medicinal prices
Recently, "price gouging" of medical supplies/prescription drugs etc. has become a popular topic.
Most recently with [the epipen price increase] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/08/23/u-s-lawmakers-demand-investigation-of-100-price-hike-of-life-saving-epipens/) 

and prior with the infamous [martin shkreli increase the price of a prescription drug] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/02/how-pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-described-his-own-drug-price-hike-almost-all-of-it-is-profit/)

incidentally he weighed in with the epipen price [increase] (http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ex-pharma-ceo-martin-shkreli-weighs-in-on-skyrocketing-epipen-prices/)

I'd prefer to avoid the "moral" argument of "who should tell anybody what they can and can't sell at whatever price"


there are other arguments as to why the drugs are so high in the first place, such as [regulation] (http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/28/health/us-pays-more-for-drugs/) which would fit in with the "free market" idea.

while others have argued [that it is due to the lack of price control and other government actions] (http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-multiple-factors-cause-high-prescription-drug-prices-in-us-2015-9) basically the antithesis of "free market"

[thomas sowell a free market economist explains that there is no way the government can lower price without lowering the quality of the drug] (http://townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/2003/06/17/drugs_and_politics)


thank you and I look forward to hearing possible answers to the solution and if the "free market" would be one of them.
