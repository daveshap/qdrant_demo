What Certifications May I Benefit a From? (Pricing Analyst)
I am a pricing analyst with an ongoing year of experience, straight out of college. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s of Business Administration in disciplines of finance and business management.

I use Microsoft Office applications (Word, Excel, Outlook, Access) on a regular basis, with intermediate skills in Excel (VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, etc.). Using data sets on Excel & assumptions, perform pricing/profitability analysis to support other departments for new and existing business opportunities. I also provide quantitative analyses pertaining to sales data to back my claims in decision making. I have no experience with Visual Basic, and no coding experience (I only utilized access to obtain information, with some experience managing backend data). 

My career goals are currently flexible. I like the idea of perfecting my craft and moving up within the corporate ladder. I am also open to pursuing other opportunities if value is offered for financial, personal and professional growth. I am open to pursuing a senior pricing analysis role in the relevant future, while also open to doing something more influential/managerial in the future.
