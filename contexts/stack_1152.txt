Deleting old data in MySQL becomes slower over time I have an application running on Amazon MySQL/RDS that needs to maintain 2 weeks of transactional history after which time data can (usually) be purged. Because this isn't a hard rule I cannot use partitioning by day or week as a means to delete old data most efficiently.There are several tables that need purging, many of them have multiple indexes and foreign key constraints (parent/child).I'm deleting data in chunks (1000-3000 rows at a time) and committing after each chunk. After a set number of chunks have been deleted the purge code pauses for a set amount of time.My issue is that the process is very efficient for 10-15 minutes, after which I begin to see large delays in deleting data chunks. I believe my SQL is as efficient as it can be. Where in MySQL can I look to better understand the bottleneck? If I stop my code and wait 15-20 minutes the delete performance is restored for another 10 minutes.
