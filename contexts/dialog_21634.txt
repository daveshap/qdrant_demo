MAXWELL: You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
MRS. BUCKLEY: How? What can I do?
MAXWELL: [Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy. She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
MRS. BUCKLEY: It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
MAXWELL: Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
