BENSINGER: How do you mean?
BURNS: I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
BENSINGER: Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
BURNS: I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
BENSINGER: Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
BURNS: The poem?... The poem was great!
BENSINGER: Remember the ending?  -- and all is well
BURNS: Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
BENSINGER: What?
