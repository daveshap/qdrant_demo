CARLO: Look at this...Jesus.
JACK: Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
CARLO: No. But it buys a lot of other things.
JACK: Like that piece of ass he was with.
CARLO: Well...I don't mind. I can put up with it. I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
JACK: Not me. I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
CARLO: Well, more power to you. Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
JACK: I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
