Looking at a career change from freelancing and want to know if there are very flexible positions that afford a similar feel to freelancing.
I've been working in the music and musical theatre field since I was 18, I'm 29 now. Since COVID, music and live performances are drowning and I would like to find something else to do. I have a lot of skills, created a LinkedIn and ZipRecruiter profile and have been applying to what ever I can. 

I am a freelancer and entrepreneur at heart and I really don't want to give up that flexible schedule. I like flex schedules and essentially want to find a job that doesn't put hourly as priority. I want something that puts tasks as a priority first so I can accomplish what needs to get done without the pressure of having to arrive somewhere for a 9-5 job. I know some exist but I am wondering if there are jobs and companies that do solely this where they don't label the positions as "40-hours per week". 

Maybe I'm being too nit-picky but I really want to build my own thing. Any insight or experience in this stuff would be great!
