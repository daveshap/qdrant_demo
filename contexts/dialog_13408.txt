BETSY: They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital. I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
WILKENS: Very well. That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements. Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
BETSY: That is good. But I'd like to know more about the case.
WILKENS: I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
BETSY: That will mean another interview, won't it?
WILKENS: No, this is quite final. You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter. He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
BETSY: The West Indies?
WILKENS: A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
BETSY: But it's so far away...
WILKENS: That's rather nice, isn't it?
