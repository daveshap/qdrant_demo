RAZININ: Good morning, Comrade.
NINOTCHKA: Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
RAZININ: Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
NINOTCHKA: Yes, it does.
RAZININ: You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
NINOTCHKA: Yes.
RAZININ: That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
NINOTCHKA: I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
RAZININ: Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
NINOTCHKA: May I ask why?
RAZININ: Please... sit down.
RAZININ: Cigarette?
NINOTCHKA: Thank you.
RAZININ: Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
NINOTCHKA: No.
RAZININ: I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
NINOTCHKA: May I ask what has happened?
RAZININ: As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur. This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every caf√© and night club. Here... How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives
NINOTCHKA: Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
RAZININ: It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
NINOTCHKA: You want me to go to Constantinople?
RAZININ: Yes... leaving immediately.
NINOTCHKA: I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
RAZININ: That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
NINOTCHKA: I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
RAZININ: I don't understand.
NINOTCHKA: How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
RAZININ: Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
NINOTCHKA: I will do my best.
