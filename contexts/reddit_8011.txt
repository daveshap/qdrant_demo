SUNY Students - Huge Dilemma IS Tuition
Hi everyone

I'm an incoming SUNY student. I lived in NY for a number of years and am a NY resident. However, the school requires me to show continued presence for 12 months up to the start of school. The issue is my lease in NY ends in Feb 2020 and I don't plan to move for school until June or July 2020. I planned the few months in between to be spent crashing at friend's and family's to save some money. I realize now that this could present an issue with IS tuition.

Is there any solution to this? The only solution I can think of is getting an extension of my lease which is unlikely given I'm in NYC. Or finding a shor term 6 month lease or something where I currently am and then move into school once that short term runs out. Both options are expensive but I don't see an alternative.
