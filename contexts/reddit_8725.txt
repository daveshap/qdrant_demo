How has China handled the economic effects of COVID-19 as it relates to workers, businesses, and markets?
Starting in late January, China began to [quarantine millions of its citizens](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective) in hopes of containing the spread of novel coronavirus.

Only now is Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, [beginning to re-open](https://www.foxnews.com/world/china-end-lockdown-coronavirus-hubei-wuhan).

Now, as the [West faces the virus](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51970379) and enacts various versions of travel restrictions, the negative [economic impacts](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/489174-imf-coronavirus-recession-will-be-as-bad-as-financial-crisis) of the virus have become clear, and the [United States](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/politics/congress-vote-coronavirus-economic-stimulus/index.html), as [well](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak) as [many](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-europe-germany-unveils-stimulus-italy-tightens-lockdown-as-death-toll-rises.html) other [countries](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/italy-wants-more-public-spending-to-fight-coronavirus-amid-lockdown.html), are in various stages of crafting economic packages to help workers, businesses, and markets.

Since China just went through a version of what much of the West is beginning to go tackle, I wanted to ask about a few aspects of China's economic responses to COVID-19.

1. In the short term, how did China handle the economic logistics of millions of citizens not going to work? For example, in the United States many [workers live paycheck to paycheck](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/14/paycheck-to-paycheck-most-americans-struggle-financially-survey-says/39940123/). Was this a problem for China? Did it prevent citizens from paying rent, buying groceries?

2. The US financial markets have been [wildly unstable](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/when-will-financial-markets-hit-bottom-past-may-not-hold-n1164966). Did this happen in China? How was it managed?

3. Is there a good idea on the total economic cost to China since travel restrictions were put in place? For example, an assessment of small businesses that might not re-open, such as restaurants and other stores without enough cash buffer to survive a prolonged shutdown?

4. As Wuhan gets back to work, and the rest of China gets back to normal, is there an economic stimulus plan being crafted for the country? What does it looks like?
