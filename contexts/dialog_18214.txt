MONKEYBONE: Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
STU: <i></i> HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
STU: <u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
MONKEYBONE: Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
STU: I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
MONKEYBONE: Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
