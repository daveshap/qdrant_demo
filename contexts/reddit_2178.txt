Anyone else having these “Oh I’ll totally get in” moments followed by crippling “I’m getting rejected by every school even my safeties” moments?
One moment I’ll check Naviance and see that I’m above average as an applicant and have total faith in my essays that I spent weeks on, and then the next I’ll be in a corner stressing about opening up a rejection letter.
