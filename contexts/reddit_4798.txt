I don’t know who I am
I don’t think I’ve ever known. I realized that my personality is just a collection of traits that I’ve absorbed from people in my life. Idk maybe that’s standard. 
I don’t have any hobbies, or talents. I don’t know what to do with my life. 
All my past relationships I realized I was just being used as a placeholder until they found the better choice. I was never someone’s favorite person. I’m easily taken advantage of—I’m too nice. 
I’m lost. I guess I feel empty and hopeless. I feel like I have no purpose. I feel like a waste of life, like a disappointment. Compliments don’t effect me, and I never believe them. I don’t feel real emotions anymore; I’ve gotten damn good at faking them. I’ve felt like this for too long. I don’t want to do this anymore, I want to end it all. The only reason I haven’t done anything bad is because I guess I have family that loves me. I don’t know why they do though. I don’t trust doctors at all so the thought of going to therapy is scary. 
Sorry. I guess I just needed a place to rant. It’s late. I can’t sleep but I wish I could, and never wake up.
