BERNSTEIN: Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
DARDIS: Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
BERNSTEIN: I'm on deadline.
DARDIS: You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
BERNSTEIN: Whatever.
DARDIS: I'll never get out of here in time.
BERNSTEIN: The telephone calls... we know about that.
DARDIS: The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
BERNSTEIN: --yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
