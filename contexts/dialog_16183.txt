DAD: Now that was an experience. You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time."
NICKY: Definitely.
DAD: I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
NICKY: Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
DAD: Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
NICKY: Metallica, Dad. Come on.
DAD: I was just playing with you.
DAD: I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
DAN: C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
DAD: In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
DAN: You did it for Namath.
DAD: Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
DAN: This is bullshit, man. I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
DAD: Now you're talking.
NICKY: You're a good devil, Dad.
DAD: And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
