How can I turn my automotive photography hobby into a side job?
I got a Canon T3 last year and had always wanted to get into photography. I love cars and I find car photography really fun, challenging, and personally something I'm good at. I work at Mercedes-Benz and have been paid to photograph a few of our events, including a rally at a professional racetrack. I also run the social media pages for our dealership. 

I could use some extra money and I see others doing photography for a side job (even full time) so I figured why not me? I have a website (www.spencersheehan.us) with all my work and a contact page but what else should I do to grow my business? Send out cold emails to body shops who might want to showcase their work? I put up a craigslist ad for my services at $75/hour (is that enough?) Any other tips for making this a side job?
