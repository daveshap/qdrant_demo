This sub is a resource and supportive community not a competition.
You don't need to have a 3.5+ GPA or a 1300+ SAT to be here.  There are no prizes for being the smartest person here.  You don't need to be aiming for T20s or Ivies to benefit immensely from /r/A2C.  

Every year many of you learn about amazing schools that you might not have otherwise considered (like Trinity, Rose Hulman, Harvey Mudd, Colorado School of Mines, and many top LACs).  But many of you also find less selective colleges that are a perfect fit for you. 

Every year many of you find out about massive scholarships [like these](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/azu8o2/change_your_trajectory_full_ride_scholarship/) that change the trajectory of your life.  SO. MANY. top students miss out on those because they have earlier application deadlines.  There is a Scrooge McDuck vault of scholarship gold just waiting for you to go for a swim - so go get it.

Every year "mediocre" students with a 1200 SAT get a near full ride to a less selective school because they were well above that school's 75th percentile and this sub helped them [build an outstanding application](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/bktw1k/how_to_do_a_chanceme_and_improve_your_chances/).

Every year seniors move on and leave wholesome posts thanking this community for helping them with the process.  You don't have to be perfect.  You don't have to compare yourself to others.  Just focus on being the best possible version of yourself.

Finally, remember that this sub is not representative of all college applicants.  Most people who engage with a community about college admissions are going to be highly organized and motivated students with outstanding stats.  It's sort of like how you almost never see 3 star reviews.  If it was awesome or horrific you take the time to leave a 5 or 1 star review, but if it was Applebees, you just don't bother.  Don't let the other 5 star students here make you feel like Applebees by comparison.  Instead, take advantage of the vast knowledge and resources available here and make yourself better.
