BRIAN: Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
CARRIE: Thanks. What are you doing?
BRIAN: Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
CARRIE: So how's it going?
BRIAN: ...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
BRIAN: ...and I think I know why.
CARRIE: Why?
BRIAN: Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
CARRIE: This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
BRIAN: Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
CARRIE: A book on the warehouse murders?
BRIAN: A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
BRIAN: What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California. We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean.""
CARRIE: It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
BRIAN: We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
