NEIL: Todd, what's the matter?
TODD: It's my birthday.
NEIL: It is? Happy Birthday. You get anything?
NEIL: This is your desk set. I don't get it.
TODD: They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
NEIL: Oh..
TODD: Oh.
NEIL: Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one. Maybe they thought...
TODD: Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother! His birthday's always a big to-do. The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
NEIL: Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
TODD: what?
NEIL: I mean, this is one special gift! Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
TODD: Yeah! And just look at this ruler!
