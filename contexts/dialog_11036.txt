MICHAEL: Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state. I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here. The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
SENATOR GEARY: I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are. I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
MICHAEL: We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator. But never think it applies to my family.
SENATOR GEARY: All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
