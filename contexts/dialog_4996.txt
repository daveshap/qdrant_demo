NICOLE: So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
BUFFY: That's the plan.
NICOLE: Good enough!
JENNIFER: Your parents are always going away for the weekend. You're so lucky.
BUFFY: Yeah, I guess.
JENNIFER: My mom doesn't go anywhere. She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
KIMBERLY: What did Jeffrey's dad say?
BUFFY: 'Just remember you're in training, son'
NICOLE: Oh, God.
KIMBERLY: He is so bald.
PIKE: Will you guys shut up, please?
BUFFY: It could happen.
PIKE: Booo!
BENNY: Suck!
PIKE: Wrong answer! No prize.
NICOLE: God! Take a chill lozenge.
KIMBERLY: Like we don't have rights too?
