NICK: I'll take them all.
AUDREY: You must have quite some harem.
NICK: Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
AUDREY: It's good to see you, Nick.
NICK: So you made it.
AUDREY: What?
NICK: You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
AUDREY: Yeah, well...
AUDREY: So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
NICK: No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real boring" creatures. Very reliable
AUDREY: You're still mad at me, aren't you?
NICK: You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
AUDREY: That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
NICK: Most people don't.
AUDREY: I'm sorry you feel that way.
NICK: Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
AUDREY: Sure. I'd like that.
