JAKE: I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
BUTCH: And these cops? What do they get?
JAKE: Just a tip.
SOBOZINSKI: What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
ROTTOVICH: You sell it.
SOBOZINSKI: To who?
ROTTOVICH: Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
SOBOZINSKI: You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
ROTTOVICH: What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
SOBOZINSKI: Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
ROTTOVICH: It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
ROTTOVICH: Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
SOBOZINSKI: Whoa, whoa... There he is.
