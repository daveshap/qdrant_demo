How honest should I be with the recruiter? Need advice.
Should I tell the recruiter that I am not accepting the offer because I prefer to start in a certain location first before moving somewhere else?

The thing is I was offered a job in Europe initially (signed it already). But coronavirus destroyed almost everything and now projects are currently on-hold until I-don't-know-when, and now they are offering a job in South Asia. Also I explicitly mentioned during the interview that I am open to be relocated whenever necessary. While this willingness is still true, I would really want to start first in my preferred location (Europe) for maybe 3 months or more before moving somewhere else.

Would it also be fine if I mention to them that I am willing to wait for another project in different location?
