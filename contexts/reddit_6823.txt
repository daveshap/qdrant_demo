Responding to work emails post-layoff
I was laid off last week. Today I got an email from an old coworker asking for help with something. She has taken over my project, while I was laid off. She wasn't involved in my project to begin with, so there's a lot of stuff she doesn't know.

Her question is simple enough, but I'm worried it's going to open a door to her constantly asking me questions. Then I'll be doing work for free. Her question also seems like she put no critical thought before coming to me.

I mostly feel like the company laid me off, they can deal with whatever consequences of that without me. If they feel like they need me, they can give me my job back.

Thoughts?

Edit: it was an email from someone at work to my personal email. And this person 100% knows I was laid off. Thanks for all the feedback.

At this point, I'm considering just saying "I don't remember without looking at the project." And if they ask me to do that, then I'll ask a consulting fee. The question really is simple, but because it's a question that could have been easily discovered if my coworker spent a minute looking at my work, it just feels like they're testing boundaries. There's literally a note on my project that would answer her question.
