BETTY: You're really something Coco...thank you.
COCO: Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
RITA: Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
BETTY: Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT: Nice wallets.
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD: Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT: The one of 'em still alive?
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD: Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT: Oh yeah.
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD: Well he said... you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT: Find out who they are?
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD: Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT: Interesting.
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD: Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT: Where at?
DETECTIVE NEAL DOMGAARD: Palmdale.
DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT: Damn, that's a long drive.
BETTY: I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.
RITA: Good luck!
BETTY: When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
RITA: Okay.
BETTY: Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
COCO: It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
BETTY: No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
COCO: His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
BETTY: Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
COCO: Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
BETTY: Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
COCO: Get going. You don't want to be late.
BETTY: Right. See ya.
COCO: Good luck, honey!
