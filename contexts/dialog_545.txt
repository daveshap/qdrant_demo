CLAUDIA: Sandro, I'm not coming down.
SANDRO: Why?
CLAUDIA: I'm too sleepy.
SANDRO: Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
SANDRO: You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
CLAUDIA: Late, very late.
