EMILY: Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney’s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
WHITNEY: And losing you, we’d lose him. And that would be a shame, don’t you agree?
WHITNEY: Hi...
EMILY: If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
WHITNEY: Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes, Mr Lombard - confused and frightened victims. It’s all too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what we’ve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make ‘em sit up and listen.
EMILY: It’s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn’t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
LOMBARD: A criminal?
EMILY: Did you not enter this country illegally?
LOMBARD: Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
EMILY: Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
