MARA: Please not be touching me, Conor.
CONOR: I'll not take that kind of talk from you. From those others below, maybe. But not from you.
MARA: Leave me alone, Conor. Please.
CONOR: You're not talking sense, Mara!
CONOR: If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
MARA: Do what you must.
