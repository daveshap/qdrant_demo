DR. HIRSCH: Can I be of service, Miss Price?
ALEX: Dr. Hirsch?
DR. HIRSCH: Go about your duties.
ALEX: Yes, Doctor.
DR. HIRSCH: Oh, Miss Price?
ALEX: Yes, Doctor?
DR. HIRSCH: What exactly did he call out?
ALEX: He said 'Jack'.
DR. HIRSCH: That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
ALEX: What happened to them?
DR. HIRSCH: The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
ALEX: No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
DR. HIRSCH: Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
DAVID: Where am I?
DR. HIRSCH: You're in a hospital in London.
DAVID: London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
DR. HIRSCH: I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
DAVID: The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
DR. HIRSCH: Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
