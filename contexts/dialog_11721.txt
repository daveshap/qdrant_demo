ANNIE: I should go get some of her things.
ROBERT: No, let me go.
ANNIE: No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
ROBERT: I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment... I wanted to say something... But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
ANNIE: We're very lucky.
ROBERT: The funeral's on Friday.
ROBERT: Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
ANNIE: Okay.
ROBERT: It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him... ... Whether or not we were... ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
ROBERT: ... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
ANNIE: Oh. Right. I'll call him.
