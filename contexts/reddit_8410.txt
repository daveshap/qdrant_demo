What are the public policy benefits of the US memorializing slavery the way Germany memorializes the Holocaust?
The [traditional question](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-debate-over-confederate-monuments-and-how-to-remember-the-civil-war) America has to answer is the place of Civil War statues and their public homage to that conflict. They arguably lionize secession and slavery, not necessarily in that order. The counterpoint is that they also make it difficult for Americans to forget important and violent divisions that nearly tore apart the country. 

In Germany, they likewise have a violent and disturbing history: the Holocaust. They're not direct parallels, particularly since the Nazis don't track any sort of regional pride, but they have a shared quality of being ugly and generally discomforting to think about. They present an almost palpable part of each country's history.

Germany [decided]( https://www.thelocal.de/20161019/how-germany-remembers-the-holocaust-world-war-two-nazis-jewish-history-germans) it was in its peoples' [best interest](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/10colwe.html) to [memorialize](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/member-countries/holocaust-education-remembrance-and-research-germany) the failings of German society in confronting the forces leading to the Holocaust, and requires its citizens and visitors alike to confront its existence.

Would there be a public policy interest in the US to enact similar memorials to the tragedy of slavery, i.e. create public memorials and statues to the assorted depravities of American slavery? What would be the counterarguments?
