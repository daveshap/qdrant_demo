Correlation length at low temperatures? The correlation length gives (approximately) the distance over which a spin flip has an effect. For systems with ordered phases, at low temperatures the correlation length is then small (since a single spin flip will have little affect due to the large energy needed to rotate all the spins).But the one-dimensional Ising model (although it doesn't have an ordered phase) has a correlation length that diverges at low temperature. Given what I have said above and given at $T=0$ for the 1D Ising we do get an ordered phase, why is the correlation length diverging instead of going to zero?
