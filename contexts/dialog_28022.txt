HAL: You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
LOUISE: Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
HAL: I do believe you. That's what I want everybody to believe. Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
