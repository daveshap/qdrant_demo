DUFFY: Good afternoon.
JOHANA: I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
DUFFY: Yes. Of course. Very wise.
JOHANA: Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium. Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me... ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have... One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars. But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
DUFFY: You're right. You're fired.
JOHANA: Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave? I'm pregnant.
DUFFY: The Italian, I presume?
JOHANA: No. He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
DUFFY: He seems to have won it.
JOHANA: Yes, isn't it wonderful? I'm so happy. I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
