Recruiter at large company does not read cover letters
I just had a phone interview with a recruiter for a large cleared defense contractor in the Washington D.C. area.  She mentioned that they do not read cover letters but just review the resumes.  She only read my cover letter because she could not find some critical information on my resume (my bad).  Just FYI.
