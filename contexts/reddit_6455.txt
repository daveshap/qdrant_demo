Is there an online community discussing and comparing big corporation's cultures?
About a year ago I joined a company – one of the really big names in a really good industry – as an engineer in an apprentice middle management position, and I discovered that, frankly, there does not seem to be a lot of competent people over there except for the lowest tier of management and their blue collar subordinates. The chaos and lack of competence is not even the people’s own fault, because the organization is obsessing over all kinds of things except real productivity, retaining their experienced employees, and training the new ones. One thing in particular is costing them a lot of money and even more so consuming a hell of a lot of time of all individuals throughout the organization.

While I get a good salary for a stable job that’s not demanding at all, there is no fun in having one of the more useless positions in a company that has a lot of fat to trim, and I wish I could have known more about company culture in advance of applying for the job. I understand that in every company there will always be some corporate bullshit to deal with, but I heard from experienced colleagues that this is one of the more absurd companies, so in a few years I’d like to find myself an environment that is frankly just more fulfilling to work in. I wonder therefore if there is a good forum somewhere where people discuss the management culture in the companies they(’ve) work(ed) for?
