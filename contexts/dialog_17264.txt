HAWKEYE: Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
GENERAL HAMMOND: Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
HAWKEYE: Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
GENERAL HAMMOND: Right.
HAWKEYE: So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
HAWKEYE: And there it is.
GENERAL HAMMOND: I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
HAWKEYE: Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
TRAPPER: It certainly isn't Henry's fault Hot Lips Houlihan doesn't like her name.
DUKE: Or her figger.
