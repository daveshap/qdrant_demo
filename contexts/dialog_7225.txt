CHARLIE: Mr. Keating!
KEATING: I don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, Mr. Dalton, but, whatever it was, I hope you've learned your lesson.
CHARLIE: You're siding with Mr. Nolan?! What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
KEATING: Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles. You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
CHARLIE: But I thought-
CHARLIE: Yeah? Like what?
KEATING: Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
CHARLIE: Yes sir.
KEATING: So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
