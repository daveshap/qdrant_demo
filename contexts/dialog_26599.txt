RISA: What do you mean?
MITCHELL: People who will help our cause.
RISA: Well, there's the Hamiltons. Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
WENDELL: Yeah, right.
MITCHELL: That's great, Wendell. That's the sort of thing I need to know. So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
RISA: There's the Prescots...
WENDELL: That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town. He's about to lose his house and car.
RISA: But Charlene...
WENDELL: Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night. Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
WENDELL: Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters. They're all inbred.
RISA: The Ottos.
MITCHELL: Tell me about the Ottos.
RISA: Wanda and Hartley. They lost Bear. He was their adopted son. A beautiful boy. Indian.
MITCHELL: Indian?
RISA: Yes.
MITCHELL: That's good. Judges like adopted Indian boys. Tell me more about the Ottos.
RISA: They're smart. Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
MITCHELL: What do they do?
RISA: Crafts.
MITCHELL: Crafts?
RISA: Wanda does these photographic things. That's one of her pictures on the wall.
WENDELL: Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
RISA: You don't know that.
MITCHELL: Have they ever been busted?
RISA: No.
