How do I stop the gut-reaction when I see philosopher's names?
When I read certain academic works, I always end up getting really frustrated or irritated with the constant invocation of philosophers like Foucalt, Sartre, etc. I don't believe there's necessarily anything *wrong* with using these philosophers in academic writing and reading, but what are some things that I can do to better understand *why* people use these ideas in their writing?   


At the moment I'm more inclined to just go "shut the fuck up" in my head rather than try to be open about the  kinds of ideas that the writers (especially during peer reveiw) are invoking. At the moment it just feels like I'm reading a bunch of bullshit rather than something that would supplement my understanding of an article or book.
