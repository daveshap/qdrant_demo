FRIDA: I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.
JENNIFER: You have to stop being so self- critical Frida.
FRIDA: I looked like an Italian man!
JENNIFER: How'd it go with the cop?
FRIDA: We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
JENNIFER: Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
FRIDA: It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
JENNIFER: Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
