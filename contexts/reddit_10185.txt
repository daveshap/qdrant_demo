I'm a pedophile and I think I'm ready to kill myself
I've never had a normal sex drive and I thought I was asexual for a while, but I guess the reality is more insidious. I've struggled with Pure O OCD ever since I was a child, and at first I thought this was it. I've always worried about hurting people. My sexuality has been an topic of anxiety since grade school, since I have been borderline asexual my whole life. Late high school was when it began, although I was never able to accept it then. It hit like a truck last summer where I had multiple panic attacks due to these thoughts that put me in a mental hospital. I hoped the drugs they gave me would help end the fetish, but they only helped the anxiety and depression. It has been getting steadily worse ever since. Most therapists understandably don't want to see me. Yesterday I masturbated to an anime child (thankfully I have never looked up illegal images). I think at this point it hit what I had become and I lost hope for redemption. I am a ticking time bomb before I ruin someones life. And I can't live with myself like this. I can never have a SO, or a family. Even having friends feels wrong. It's going to be be hard as I actually enjoy my life quite a bit. But I feel like this is the only responsible and logical thing to do. End it now while I'm still me, before this takes over. From now on I plan to stop taking my meds, as the mood swings will help me get this done. Then end by exit bag or hanging while listening to Avril 14th. I am tired of the self pity and ready to take responsibility. Wish me the luck and courage to end this. Thank you.
Edit: Still here. Going to look into some more mental or physical health options before making a decision I think. Thank you for your kindness even if I don't understand it.
