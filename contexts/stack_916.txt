To create a dual-boot system: which OS should I install first? I want to reset my laptop's hard-drive and create a dual-boot system, using both Windows 10 (for gaming) and Ubuntu 18.04 (for everything else). Currently my PC uses Ubuntu 18.04 as sole operating system. After formatting the hard-disk, what should I install first? Ubuntu or Windows?I know that in the second case I need to restore the Ubuntu's GRUB because Windows has this tendency of overwrite the master boot record, but that a minor issue for me. Thanks!
