DICK VAN DYKE: Where's the remote control I gave you?
DAVID: Why?
DICK VAN DYKE: Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
DAVID: No you're not.
DICK VAN DYKE: EXCUSE ME?
DAVID: I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
DICK VAN DYKE: JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE!
DICK VAN DYKE: OW!
DAVID: I'm going to leave now.
DICK VAN DYKE: You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
