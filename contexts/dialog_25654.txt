RASCZAK: You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
JOHNNY: The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
RASCZAK: The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
JOHNNY: Uh, I don't know.
RASCZAK: Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
