DOM: Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
MARY: You sent that?
DOM: Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
MARY: Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
DOM: That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
MARY: That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
