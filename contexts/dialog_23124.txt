DEBBIE SALT: Hi, Gale, any leads?
GALE: Tons and tons.
DEBBIE SALT: Where is Sidney's father?
GALE: Home--where he lives.
DEBBIE SALT: And are the police sure about that?
GALE: Why don't you ask them?
DEBBIE SALT: Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
GALE: No, I don't.
DEBBIE SALT: Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
GALE: Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
