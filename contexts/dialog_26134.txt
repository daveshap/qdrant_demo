AMBASSADOR DE SADE: Don't you dare touch me! What the devil do you think you're doing?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
AMBASSADOR DE SADE: Give that back to me.
GENERAL SCHMUCK: What do you think of this, Mister President? I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: What's the meaning of this?
AMBASSADOR DE SADE: I am sorry. Sub-miniature photography is my hobby. It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: I'll hold this, if you don't mind. You can have it back when you leave.
