Does anybody else disassociate?
I think that's the word I'm looking for. Anyway, whenever I feel an anxiety attack coming on I can physically feel myself leave my body to prevent it from happening. If someone tries to talk to me I become really distant and short. I look into the distance a lot and just try not to be in the moment, because if I am the anxiety will overwhelm me.

Does anybody else experience this or anything like this? Or does anybody know how to deal with this when it happens?
