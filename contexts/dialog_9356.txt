BRAD: You're not going to tell me, are you?
STACY: No.
BRAD: All right, then. It's your secret.
STACY: I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
LINDA: That little prick.
STACY: Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
LINDA: That little prick.
STACY: I paid for it and everything.
LINDA: There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
STACY: Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
LINDA: Stacy, he's not a guy. He's a little prick!
