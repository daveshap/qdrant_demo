SOFIE: When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
MUMFORD: That's what I like.
SOFIE: Which thing?
MUMFORD: Either one.
SOFIE: Why'd you come to the house the other night?
MUMFORD: I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
SOFIE: My brother said you were about to fire me.
MUMFORD: That's one way to put it.
SOFIE: I bet I know what changed your mind... ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
MUMFORD: I thought only action movies had villains like that.
