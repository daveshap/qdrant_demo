Continuous X Dummy Variable interaction Interpretation I have an experiment where the same subjects perform a task under 3 conditions: saline (control), under drug A, and under drug B. The task has a parameter, \"uncertainty\that ranges from 0 to 1, and makes the task easier or harder.I want a linear model that explains the performance of the subject based on drug treatment, and uncertainty, and potential interactions. So far, I have:Performance ~ a + b1 * drugA + b2 * drugB + b3 * uncertainty + b4 * drugA x uncertainty + b5 * drugB x uncertaintyThe variables drugA and drugB are dummy variables, where:if drugA = 0, drugB = 0, then session was saline (control)if drugA = 1, drugB = 0, then session was under drug Aif drugA = 0, drugB = 1, then session was under drug BOK. So I run the regression using statsmodel's OLS, and only the intercept 'a' and parameter 'b1' come out significant. The intercept not being 0 doesn't really mean much, so finally my question is about the interpretation of 'b1' being significant. IF the interaction terms were not there, the interpretation to me is straightforward: the difference in performance between control and drugA is significant. Since the interaction term b4 was present, the interpretation changes. I think it means that the difference in performance between control and drugA, controlling for uncertainty, is significant. 1) is that interpretation correct ?2) if that is true, why is the interaction not significant. Let's pretend the b4 (drugA x uncertainty) interaction is significant. What is the interpretation there ? Is it the difference in performance between control and drug A is greater when there is uncertainty (uncertainty > 0) than when there isn't (uncertainty = 0) ? What is weird to me is that both b1 and b4 coming out significant seem to me to mean the same thing, and that can't be right. Any clarification is greatly appreciated.
