How to display pie charts in a web map created using QGIS? I have created a web map to show some sales information using QGIS with Leaflet library.I wonder if there is a way to show pie charts in the same web map as a separate layer?Although pie charts are visible in the QGIS desktop version, it disappears when it converts to a web map.I guess there should be a way to edit the HTML file to make pie charts visible. I would be extremely grateful if anyone of you can shed some knowledge on this.
