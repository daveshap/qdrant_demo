Giving away Student Affairs books! Please help :)
Hi, all! 

I graduated with a degree in student affairs a few years ago, but my life has turned in a few unexpected directions, so I no longer need some of my textbooks. I would love to send them to SA students or SA professionals who could put them to better use! **You may have the book for free, as long as you cover the price of shipping** which will probably be $5 or less (estimate, depending on where you live). If your conscious tells you to pay a little more for the book, that's fine too.

Here is what I have to offer:


* The Craft of Research: 3rd Edition
