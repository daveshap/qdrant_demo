Full time job vs Graduate Assistantship
I have been accepted to a Masters program at my alma mater. Recently they had a preview day for incoming students, so I got to meet people who are in the program and who have graduated. They have all done assistantships. It’s a 36 credit program and the assistantship waives 16 credits per year, so it’s actually really good. However, you have to be a full time student to do the assistantship. 

Now to me. I work a full time 9-5 job but they are very flexible and laid back, so I know I could do some school work there. I’d love to do the assistantship but I can’t afford it. All of them pay $10.42 an hour and work 25 hours a week. I have rent, bills, a car payment, and I need health insurance. 

So should I go part time school and full time work? Or should I do my first year part time, save up money, and do the assistantship the next year?
