ALFREDO: Eh! Love...what a mystery! I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them. Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants...
SALVATORE: What you say is wonderful! But sad...
ALFREDO: They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
