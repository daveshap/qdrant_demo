KAREN: That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
CHILI: Depends, who pays?
KAREN: Definitely not Martin. Movie stars never pick up the check. They have no idea what things cost. Most of them don't know their zip code and a lot don't even know their own phone number.
CHILI: How'd you meet Martin anyway?
KAREN: Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
CHILI: I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
KAREN: You don't like Martin much, do you?
CHILI: Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
KAREN: For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
KAREN: So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
CHILI: How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
KAREN: How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
CHILI: That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right. Although I've added to it.
KAREN: Yeah?
CHILI: Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
KAREN: Really.
KAREN: I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
CHILI: You thought I was faking?
KAREN: No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
CHILI: Oh.
CHILI: You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
KAREN: Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
CHILI: I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -â€“
KAREN: Hey, Chili? Look at me.
