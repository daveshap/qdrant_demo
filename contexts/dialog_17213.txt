ANGIE: Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
MARTY: I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
ANGIE: Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
MARTY: We just talked.
ANGIE: Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
JOE: I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
LEO: That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
JOE: I never thoughta that.
MARTY: I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
ANGIE: She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
