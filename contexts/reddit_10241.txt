 THANK YOU EVERYONE WHO HELPED!!!!!!!! so after posting this 28 days ago I wrote my Best friend who's out of state a suicide note and I closed my phone and social media and popped some pills and right then there was a knock at my door and it was the cops they took me to a psychiatric ward were I spent a few days a little over a week it felt like a month but I swear I meet some amazing people and my family and friends visited every day and now I'm on my medication and things are turning around a lot!!!!!! I'm moving out to my Best friend and taking a semester off to recoup from school I explained to my friend about the 1k and she wasn't sweating it she said my life was more important but long story short everything worked out I love you strangers and thank you for helping me\^\_\^!xoxoxox
