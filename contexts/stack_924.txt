Remote Access to Kubuntu from Windows I've got it to work so I can get to it with TightVNC but the Kubuntu machine keeps changing the password.  I want to have a fixed password for remote access to the machine which is there when it starts up.  At the moment I have to enter a password for the KDE Wallet and change the password for unattended remote access every time I restart the Linux box.  Can anyone suggest how I can get it to remember the password and or not require a password for or not use KDE Wallet?Thanks.
