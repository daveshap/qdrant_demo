NYSSA: His name is Jared Nomak.
DAMASKINOS: Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil. Pure Thirst. Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly. Like you. Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
BLADE: Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
NYSSA: You're missing the point. Their vampire victims don't die. They turn. They become carriers. If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over. Do the math.
BLADE: You want me to hunt them for you.
DAMASKINOS: Not alone.
