LUKE: Come with me.
VADER: Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
VADER: You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
LUKE: I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
VADER: If that is your destiny.
LUKE: Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
VADER: It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
