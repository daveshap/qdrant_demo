“If only they would have reached out” = Pure bullshit
  

I see it all over the news in these ‘mental health campaigns’, some celebrity going on about how depressed people just need to talk about it. I can already picture people i know saying after my death, “if only he would have reached out”, “if only he would have talked about it”. This is fucking bullshit and they can all fuck right off. I reached out, I tried to talk to so many of you so many times, but you gave me nothing back, NOTHING! You can only reach out or talk, if people are willing to listen and people are not. 

I have always been told that i don't smile much, like it was an accusation. No-one ever bothered to ask if i was okay. I wish the transition from life-to-death was a bit easier. It's not nice to know my last moments will be filled with instinct driven panic and regret. I just want it all to stop. I need it to stop. I'm tired.
