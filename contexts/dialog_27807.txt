KLAATU: Everyone seems so--
HELEN: Jittery is the word.
KLAATU: Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
HELEN: He has his homework to keep him occupied.
KLAATU: He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
HELEN: Naturally I think so.
KLAATU: Warm and friendly and intelligent-- You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
HELEN: Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
KLAATU: Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
HELEN: Hello--
TOM: You ready?
HELEN: I will be in just a minute.
TOM: The picture starts at eight-fifty.
HELEN: I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
TOM: I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
KLAATU: Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
HELEN: Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
