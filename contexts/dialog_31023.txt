JIMMY: Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
TED: Most places are, Jimmy.
JIMMY: They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
TED: So, what brings you here at his hour?
JIMMY: My new bike.
TED: Very funny.
JIMMY: I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
TED: My room?
JIMMY: Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
TED: It's not up to me.
JIMMY: Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
TED: You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
JIMMY: If you could just sign right there.
TED: You want it in writing?
JIMMY: Just a formality.
TED: That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
JIMMY: Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
TED: Are they okay?
JIMMY: Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
TED: I miss them, too.
JIMMY: You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
TED: You're a peach.
JIMMY: Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
TED: He was my Grandfather, too.
JIMMY: I meant biologically.
TED: That's a crappy thing to say.
JIMMY: Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
JIMMY: But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
TED: I didn't forget.
JIMMY: You ever look down on them again and call them grocers" like it's a dirty word
