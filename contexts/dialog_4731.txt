LONGSHANKS: His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
EDWARD: You let Wallace escape your whole army. You cannot blame me for this.
PRINCESS: Good day to you, M'Lords.
EDWARD: You mock us with a smile?
PRINCESS: I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
EDWARD: Wallace's followers.
PRINCESS: Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
PRINCESS: I have faced him. Have you?
LONGSHANKS: Let her speak.
PRINCESS: He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
EDWARD: The little cow is insane --
PRINCESS: Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
