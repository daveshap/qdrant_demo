You give up hope and try to learn how to live by yourself they say you’re crazy and no human can live alone. You get out of your bubble and start talking to girls, they’ll call you desperate and you don’t need a girl to be happy.
Long story short I’m being driven mad, last year I spent it alone by myself taking Meds that lower libido and people said I’m killing myself this way. This year I’m out of my bubble and people are saying I’m being rash and desperate and that I don’t need a girl to be happy. 

Like wtf am I supposed to do?!!
