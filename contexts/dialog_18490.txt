MABEL: You're a fool, Babe.
BABE: I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
MABEL: Running away is no solution.
MABEL: What'll I tell him if he calls up?
BABE: Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
MABEL: You're acting like a school girl.
BABE: What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime. At least I can save him that .
