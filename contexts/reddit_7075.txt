Partner and I just quit our jobs to stay home and start a home baking business. Any tips from others who did the same/similar?
We both quit working for a company we were exhausted at to put our time and energy into baking, which we both love and have a passion for, as well as fair experience in many lines of work. We have $$$$$ saved up to support us as we know it could take several years of successful business and baking before we actually make money. We're ready to dive in headfirst and put our best foot forward, and will be baking our asses off to refine our skills before we try to sell.

We've both been researching and are aware of various licensures needed and inspections of our preparation/cooking space, but I wanted to see what others who have done similar would suggest we focus on, or odd things a newbie wouldn't have thought to think about. What do you think Reddit?
