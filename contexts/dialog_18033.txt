BUSTER: Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
VIRGINIA: Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
BUSTER: Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
VIRGINIA: What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
BUSTER: Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
ANNIE: I hope you like it.
PAUL: It looks wonderful. And so do you.
ANNIE: Oh...
PAUL: I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
ANNIE: My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
PAUL: Oh. You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
PAUL: Annie, I think we should have a toast.
ANNIE: A toast?
PAUL: Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
ANNIE: To Misery.
PAUL: Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
ANNIE: Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
PAUL: Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
ANNIE: Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
PAUL: Well, it certainly says you.
ANNIE: You really think so?
PAUL: Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
ANNIE: Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?
PAUL: It's perfect.
