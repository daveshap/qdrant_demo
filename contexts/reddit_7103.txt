First Time Goverment Job, What To Expect?
Heyo Fellow Redditors

(For further info, im a 19 year old male living in australia, so im new to goverment employment processes)

So i am in an interesting predicament, ive been working retail for the last year and a half, been a night shift worker at a petrol station while studying my certificate 4 in lab technicians. 

Now a job recently opened at my local police forensics lab that is THE PERFECT position for me, it base education requirements are a tetiary or progress towards a tetiary certificate in lab technicians. 

Now its all well and good, however this is a goverment posistion, and ive never had exprience in doing a selection criteria or basically any of the more advanced stuff above a resume.

Basically in a nutshell, im looking for recommendations on how to tackle this process as i have a lot riding on getting this posistion, and id like to know ive given it the best possible go i can.

The requested forms from what i know are a detailed resume, a cover letter, a curriculum vitae? (CV), and a selection criteria, along with a bunch of other forms that are self explanatory so im good on those ones.

Links to templates would be HIGHLY appreciated, along with tips on this type of job interview.

Thanks All
