Life changing news
I have nowhere else to post this but I really need to get it out. 

Been working for the last decade in the public school system, with my actual position being paid through a non profit. As I was working for a non profit, my pay was always low for the work I was doing, but that was the norm as schools in this area pay non profits to serve children as a way to save money.

About a year ago my companies management team took a hit when my bosses boss left. The guy who replaced her is, for lack of a better term, an idiot. The team has been struggling mightily and it has resulted in people in my position being jerked around and treated badly. About a month ago, it was my turn. New guy in management tried to fix something that didn’t need fixing by transferring me to another school. My current schools principle pulled me into the office and said she was unhappy with how my team had handled the situation, but that she felt badly, as she felt like I was made to be the scapegoat. She said her main priority in this situation was to keep me in the building, and proceeded to offer me a job.

Here’s where the life changing part comes in. Met with HR earlier to get a formal job offer and my grown ass cried like a baby in front of them. First, my pay is going up from just under $30k to just over $40k. That is a huge pay increase that was more than enough for me, but not the end of the good news. 

Four years ago, we had our first child, and My insurance went through the roof. For the last four years, I have been paying nearly $12k a year for health insurance for my son and I (about $225 a week). Well come to find out, being employed by the school system means that insurance for the two of us is covered at 100%. As in its free.

Basically my pay almost doubled. Today was a good day.
