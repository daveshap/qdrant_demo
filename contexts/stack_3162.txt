Why did the men have to go to Las Vegas in Stephen King's The Stand? In her death bed, Mother Abagail tells the Free Zone Committee that the only way to defeat Randall Flagg is for Stuart, Glen, Ralph and Larry to walk all the way to Las Vegas.  Once they (three of the four men) get there, they don't do anything much of consequence and<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  Flagg himself ends up detonating the A-bomb and killing everyone in the west.</blockquote>So the question is, why exactly did the four men have to go there? What did they achieve?
