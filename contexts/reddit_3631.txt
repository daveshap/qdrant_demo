We cuddled and held hands for 3 whole hours
I recently joined a new theatre group. The other day, we all went out at night.

I'm not sure why, but at 3am, I ended up talking to F, who had been really nice to me from the start. He wrapped his arm around me and started hugging me.

We ended up sitting together and talking. He is a rather shy-ish, skinny, nerdy guy who works on cyber security.  We cuddled, held hands, carressed eachorther. He kissed me a few times on my forehead. Our faces were super close... I really felt something.
