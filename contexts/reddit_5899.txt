In college trying to choose a career path.
I was going to switch to psychology, but I think I’m going to stick it out with my major. I’m majoring in media and information with a focus on media management/human centered technology. Not a fan of the classes. Careers that interest me are experimental psychologist/research, psych teacher, and school psychologist (though I need a masters for those). 

I’m in my 3rd year so a BS in psych degree would cost me an extra semester, and I heard it’s pretty much useless. My plan was to finish this degree and get a masters in psychology, but I feel like I’d be wasting the opportunity to get research experience prior to getting my masters. Another option is to just double major, see which one I like better, and do or don’t pursue my masters from there.
