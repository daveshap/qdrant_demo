HAWKEYE: Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
GENERAL HAMMOND: We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
HAWKEYE: I think I heard about that.
GENERAL HAMMOND: Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
HAWKEYE: Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
GENERAL HAMMOND: I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry? Thanks for the drink, boys.
DUKE: Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
HAWKEYE: All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
TRAPPER: But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
HAWKEYE: We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
DUKE: Never heard of him.
HAWKEYE: Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
DUKE: The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
TRAPPER: He only lasted one season.
HAWKEYE: On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
DUKE: How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
HAWKEYE: I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
TRAPPER: So what makes you think he'll play for us?
HAWKEYE: We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
TRAPPER: Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
HAWKEYE: He can move in here with us.
DUKE: Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
HAWKEYE: Don't tell me about your problems, boy. Explain them to Ho-Jon.
GENERAL HAMMOND: If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
HENRY: A football game?
GENERAL HAMMOND: Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
HENRY: But what about Major Houlihan?
GENERAL HAMMOND: You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
HENRY: N-n-no thanks, G-General.
SPEARCHUCKER: If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
HENRY: The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
SPEARCHUCKER: In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
HENRY: Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
SPEARCHUCKER: I used to throw the javelin.
HAWKEYE: Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
SPEARCHUCKER: Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
HAWKEYE: I'm thinking about how we can make more money. Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
HENRY: It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
HAWKEYE: It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
SPEARCHUCKER: Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
HENRY: They can't do that to me!
HAWKEYE: The bastards outconned us.
SPEARCHUCKER: I think we could still have a chance.
HAWKEYE: If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
SPEARCHUCKER: No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
DUKE: What?
SPEARCHUCKER: When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
HAWKEYE: But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
TRAPPER: Not necessarily.
UGLY JOHN: As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
TRAPPER: It's a technique Ugly John and I worked out in case something like this came up.
DUKE: Look at the size of those two beasts.
HAWKEYE: I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
