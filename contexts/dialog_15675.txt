GARE: Go!!!
HECTOR: <u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
JACK: This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
HECTOR: Bastard bit my chopper.
JACK: Hey!!
JACK: You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
KELLY: Alright, Jack!
JACK: <u>No</u>! You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
HECTOR: Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
JACK: 'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
KELLY: <u>Jack</u>!
HECTOR: I'm a civilian! You don't have any authority--
KEOUGH: I can arrest you!!
HECTOR: Then do it!!
KEOUGH: You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
HECTOR: So profound and fat.
KELLY: <u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
HECTOR: You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
KELLY: Hector. What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
HECTOR: Nothing's real.
KELLY: Excuse me?
HECTOR: <u>Nothing's</u> real. I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
HECTOR: With crocodiles... everything's even.
KELLY: I'm no psychiatrist. But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
HECTOR: I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
KELLY: Oh, bullshit.
HECTOR: Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
KELLY: No.
HECTOR: Eh. Fuck it.
KELLY: Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
HECTOR: Yes. You may. But maybe... I don't know...
KELLY: What?
HECTOR: Could we have intercourse?
JACK: Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game. They should be here by four.
KELLY: Okay.
JACK: We might as well pack.
KELLY: Good idea.
