Browse Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS Filesystem from a Ubuntu 17.04 Desktop I am afraid my Linux experience is very limited. Although not afraid to try new things ;)I have setup a 16.04 LTS Server and setup a few services.I would like to be able to browse the Server OS from my 17.04 Desktop. I have tried the other locations and trying the server IP but nothing ever happens.I can see my Windows based servers and shares as expected. My requirements ideally would be that I can use a GUI to browse files from the Server itself.I did a bit of a google but did not find anything obvious.Thanks in advance for helping this n00b.
