I cannot boot normally after online update 23.8.2018 from 16.04 to 18.04 I updated my desktop Pavillion a623.sc from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS to 18.04 LTS. After downloading I could not re-boot nor boot the desktop. The booting process starts, Ubuntu logo comes up, but the password page does not follow, instead only empy lila page stays on the screen. Now I can make booting only manually via ''Ubuntu with Linux 4.15.0-33-generic (recovery mode)'. There I updated also GNU GRUB version 2.02, but it did not help with the booting problem. ((Earlier I made similar online update to my other pc, HP 6930p laptop, and all works OK without any booting problems.))
