I don't know what to do
I feel like everything is pointless. I'm sitting in my living room on Easter with tears in my eyes while my family is blissfully unaware of my ridiculous levels of self-deprecation. I don't want to reach out to them as they don't understand, I know, I've tried. I know I may sound like a typical "misunderstood" 18 year old, but this has been a seemingly chronic problem since I was young.

I'm insecure, hateful, bitter, resentful right now and I don't know what to do. I don't have the time to encourage a hobby or something as I'm a Dual Enrollment student and will be graduating from college soon.

I can't cope.
