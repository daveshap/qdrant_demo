JAMIE: Because, growing up, books were my world.
LANDON: Were?
JAMIE: You don't know me.
LANDON: Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
JAMIE: -- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
JAMIE: You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
LANDON: Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
JAMIE: Can't you have a normal conversation?
LANDON: I don't want to have any conversation.
JAMIE: Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
