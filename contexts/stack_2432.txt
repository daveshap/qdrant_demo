Adding sigmoidal curve function in ArcGIS raster calculator? I would like to add a sigmoidal function to create a factor map In ArcMap. The function has to decrease with an increase in values.For example: The suitability should be 1 for a distance of 250m and then it should decrease as a cosine function until 1250m.250m has highest suitability value 1 and it decreases to 0 for distances more than 1250mCould someone explain how to do this using raster calculator?
