Got fired from a medical marijuana cultivation site and now having troubld getting a job
I think potential employers are seeing this on my resume and are avoiding me like the plague. For the last 18 months are so its where i worked. Do i just not list it on my resume? Should i lie and say i worked somewhere else. My son is 3 and I have to be able to support him, and we don't really have much other support.
