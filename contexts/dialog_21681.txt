COULMIER: If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
THE MARQUIS: A man after my own heart...
COULMIER: What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
THE MARQUIS: I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
COULMIER: What on earth would that require?
THE MARQUIS: A night spent with the partner of my choice.
COULMIER: You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
THE MARQUIS: I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
COULMIER: OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
THE MARQUIS: Coulmier, you animal!
COULMIER: I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
THE MARQUIS: Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
COULMIER: NOW STRIP.
