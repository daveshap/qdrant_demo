ALABAMA: Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
CLARENCE: Five.
ALABAMA: Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
CLARENCE: I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
CLARENCE: You know when you sat behind me?
ALABAMA: At the movies?
CLARENCE: Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
ALABAMA: What would make you think that?
CLARENCE: I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
ALABAMA: You're not stupid. Just wrong.
ALABAMA: I love Janis.
CLARENCE: You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
ALABAMA: She OD'd, didn't she?
CLARENCE: Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
ALABAMA: You mean she got a bad batch?
CLARENCE: That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, Look
ALABAMA: So he really loved her?
CLARENCE: Uh-huh.
CLARENCE: What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
ALABAMA: You didn't do nothing.
CLARENCE: Did you hurt yourself? Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
ALABAMA: Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
CLARENCE: What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
ALABAMA: I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
CLARENCE: You're a whore?
ALABAMA: I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know. I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
CLARENCE: Heroes For Sale"?"
ALABAMA: Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
CLARENCE: Who?
ALABAMA: I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
CLARENCE: That dazzling imagination.
ALABAMA: It's over on the TV. All it says is: Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact
CLARENCE: Who and what is a Drexl?
ALABAMA: My pimp.
CLARENCE: You have a pimp?
ALABAMA: Uh-huh.
CLARENCE: A real live pimp?
ALABAMA: Uh-huh.
CLARENCE: Is he black?
ALABAMA: He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
CLARENCE: Is he nice?
ALABAMA: Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
CLARENCE: What did he do to Arlene?
ALABAMA: Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
CLARENCE: This motherfucker sounds charming!
CLARENCE: Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
ALABAMA: At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em
CLARENCE: Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
ALABAMA: What?
CLARENCE: Will you be my wife?
ALABAMA: Yes.
CLARENCE: You will?
ALABAMA: You better not be fucking teasing me.
CLARENCE: You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
CLARENCE: Did ya ever see The Chinese Professionals"?"
ALABAMA: I don't believe so.
CLARENCE: Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
