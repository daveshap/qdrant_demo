I'm probably going to get kicked out of university
Just finished the first semester of my second year. I failed 3 out of 4 subjects, and I have to take a supplementary exam for the fourth so I have a chance at passing that. Last year I failed half my subjects, so I was already doing badly. I just checked my university account page and my status has changed from "Academic probation" to "Under consideration for exclusion". So it could be happening.

The worst part? My parents have no idea. They don't even know I've been failing. I kept telling myself I could improve, with every screwed up semester I told myself I could fix up my grades as long as I would be allowed back and you know, I even started to believe it. I didn't feel so bad about keeping my failure from my parents because I thought I could change.

I just wish I could put my head down and do some fucking *work*. This semester wasn't even that bad, I had so many opportunities to make some easy marks but I threw them away for no damn reason. I have no motivation, I'm such a fuck up, I have no idea what to do, I feel sick. I really, *really* hate the kind of person I am.

God I'm sorry if anyone actually read through all that. If you did, thank you, I don't feel like I deserve your attention.
