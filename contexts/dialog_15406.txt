PETER: As large as castles. You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
FRANK: It doesn't make sense.
KATHY: It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
ANDY: But a hundred men could move him.
PETER: He's not talking about himself.
ANDY: Then what's he talking about?
PETER: If we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we? He's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
FRANK: Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have. All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night. They're all the same type. All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
KATHY: I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
FRANK: It can't be a coincidence. The woman that owns it has a son. She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days. We're trying to locate him. There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week. We're checking that out too.
KATHY: He moves around a lot. Why?
