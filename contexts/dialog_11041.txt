FREDO: Hey Mike, what can I say?
MICHAEL: Forget it, just go take care of her.
MICHAEL: How's the baby?
KAY: Sleeping inside me.
MICHAEL: Does it feel like a boy?
KAY: Yes, Michael, it does.
MICHAEL: I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today. It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
KAY: It made me think of what you told me once. In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate. That was seven years ago.
NERI: Are you Klingman?
KLINGMAN: Who's asking?
NERI: Where can we talk?
KLINGMAN: Right here.
NERI: I represent the interests of the Corleone family. We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
KLINGMAN: Who do you think you're talking to?
NERI: You said you were Klingman.
KLINGMAN: You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
NERI: You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
KLINGMAN: Get out of my hotel.
