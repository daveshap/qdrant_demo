Planet Orbiting a Red Dwarf I'm trying to create my planet orbiting a red dwarf, honestly I've thought other scenarios but it's like every answer opens new questions. I'll just say what I want my planet to be and I'd like your help(please) to understand how it would work.I'm new with worldbuilding(started yesterday), so bear with my lack of knowledge, if you don't want to use your time answering, I'd like research sources too. I want the flora to be mainly black, so the sunlight has to be somewhat weaker, which would make the planet(or the habitable zone) fairly cold.The planet being tidally locked seems to be the common, and I don't mind, apparently the habitable zone would be the ring around the planet between the parts that do and don't face the star, but I don't know if such a thing is entirely possible, what are the complications the inhabitants of such a planet face?Apparently it doesn't have to be tidally locked, but I didn't understand how that works, apparently it would have to have some kind of moon orbiting around it?If you want to show off your knowledge and tell me how the sky would appear...I'll be impressed.If it needs something unlikely to happen for desired situations I don't mind either, the planet was somewhat \"made\" by \"gods\".Yes, sorry, I don't know much, whoever gives the time to answer, know that I'm grateful.
