Missed calls/ calls not being returned
I haven’t posted here in awhile, but need some advice. I keep getting calls from employers, they leave a message and ask me to call. I call them back and never hear back from them. I work evenings doing deliveries for Grubhub and DoorDash. I can’t really have a phone conversation at the time.  I call back the next day in those circumstances. Sometimes they call during the day and I call them back as soon as I get up. What can I do short of constantly being awake and glued to my phone? This is getting really annoying.


Edit: This is why I like communicating through email or text to set up the initial interview.
