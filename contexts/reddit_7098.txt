Parents not reacting positively for joining in startup
I am currently pursuing B.Tech in the final year of my university and recently got an offer from a service based company, XYZ. Yesterday I got a call from a startup company, ABC. ABC took an interview and decided that first I would be doing an internship in the company then based on my work I will get a full time offer. My parents are sceptical about joining this startup for full time work and want me to join XYZ, where I will not be happy to work and learn nothing. How can I convince my parents that I don't want to work in XYZ but will get to learn many things while working in ABC?
