PAUL: Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
TATIANA: They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
PAUL: Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
TATIANA: Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
PAUL: They know you are Tutsi!
TATIANA: Please, Paul, 'til first light.
PAUL: Dawn. Then they go.
