how do I get my current job to agree to allow me to work remotely
A little back story: I currently work for a start up company that has amazing potential to become something great. I won't say the name of the company bc at the moment only 3 of us work here and it's not hard to figure out who I am if you're in my area. We are located in VA and I am in charge if Administration, bringing in employees, sending emails, testing the website and apps, inventory orders, accounting etc. 

My husband and I are in the process of relocating for various reasons, the main ones being that my in laws are extremely overbearing and refuse to allow us to live our lives without constant intervening (we should have known not to move here when both of his brothers and their wives have moved away bc of this) they r supportive but in a very negative "if you didnt have us you wouldn't have anything" sort of way and we saw this as the perfect opportunity to get to NC. 

Unfortunately, that would mean leaving my job behind, SO just received his bachelors and has gotten tons of offers in NC. My entire day at work is spent in front of the computer with some filing incorporated. However, the entire administrative dept is set up, organized and run by me. I am certain that I can do my job from anywhere in the world bc all files are saved on a shared drive that we can all view and edit accordingly. 

My question is, how do I convince them that I can do this job from anywhere?? I mentioned that we were considering moving and they looked very torn about it. Is there a way for me to show that this could be a good option and a perfectly capable one?? I've worked from home before but only as a cal center agent. I have a work phone so I will still be able to speak to customers and drivers like I do in the office bc I use my work cell there as well. Any advice I'll appreciate please help!!
