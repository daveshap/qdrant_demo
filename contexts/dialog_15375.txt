KATHY: They couldn't break the riddle.
PETER: Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
KATHY: We need your help.
PETER: I offered my help this morning and Sedman turned me down.
KATHY: But you're the key. The one he wants to play the game with.
PETER: I can't right now. I've got a game.
KATHY: She could be dead after the game.
PETER: She could be dead now.
KATHY: What if she isn't? Where are your priorities? You have to think between someone's life and a chess game? The girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old! He dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
