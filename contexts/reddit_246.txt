I have a crush on a guy that apparently likes my friend and she likes him too. What should I do?

A little backstory:
They’re not dating. He has asked her out a couple times but My friend doesn’t want to date anyone right now, and not any time soon. 
I liked him before I know he liked her and that she liked him back, and I have since early November. I want to let him know how I feel but I’m afraid of embarrassing myself or having him gossip to his friends or my friend (the one he has a crush on) about it. My friend knows i like him as well.
