HOMER: What kind of plane are you flying?
WALLY: A B-24 Liberator.
HOMER: Liberator...
WALLY: Have you enlisted?
HOMER: They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
WALLY: Really! Is it serious?
HOMER: No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
