PSA: If you're using ScholarOne, the revision deadline expiration "due on [date]" means you have to submit it before that date
So maybe I'm stupid but seems like others have experienced the same situation as me (source [1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-am-coping-screwing-up-present-tense-diptiman-banerji/), [2](https://scholaronemanuscripts.ideas.aha.io/ideas/S1MI-I-670)). FYI this is my first time ever submitting a manuscript so hopefully next time I'll be more prepared and submit earlier. Hope this can be a warning to those who are using or will use ScholarOne.

I was given a revision submission deadline 'Due on \[date\]' on ScholarOne. I thought I had by the end of that date to hit the submission button. The night before I was all prepped and ready - all my documents were uploaded and I was just waiting to see if anything urgent from the other co-authors would prop up regarding acknowledgments or funding statements. The next day I came back to it and nope, the revision deadline had expired. Fortunately, it seems to be a common occurrence as the editorial board's page had a statement that said they could extend the deadline for submission that had already expired. I've emailed them and awaiting for a reply. Unfortunately it's the weekend so it might take another week for them to get back.

Also, they don't put a timezone on so I have no clue when it's going to expire. This seems like a huge oversight. I'm not sure what other submission systems are like but I hope they're better than this. Also it looks like the issue has been around for a while... it doesn't seem too hard of a problem to sort out after all these years right?
