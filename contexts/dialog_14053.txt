TYRELL: They were cut loose.
WILL: Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
JULIE: We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
TYRELL: Who?
JULIE: Ben Willis.
KARLA: Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
JULIE: They never found the body.
KARLA: Julie...
JULIE: Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
