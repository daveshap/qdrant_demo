How normal is it to attract one enemy in every work place you go?
It never fails, every work place I go, I attract 1-2 people that dislike me. They say there’s always someone that will dislike you. I say 1-2 because that’s how many people that make it evident to me, there may be more I am not sure. I’m quiet and to myself, I don’t go out of my way to please people and make a great impression. I used to and that still led in being treated like crap. There are those that seem well liked and happy, I’ve never been so fortunate. Am I just unlucky and it’s by chance I encounter tension? Or am I unrealistic and this is common? I’m 25 and this is my first real job in higher education.
