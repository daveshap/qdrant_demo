HELEN: Where were you? Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right? The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
ANDY: Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah? What happened to the newspaper?
HELEN: I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
ANDY: Well! Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door? The antenna is gone off her car again. I had no music, all the way to the market. Let me find a garage for it?
HELEN: I've told you: I can't afford to garage it.
ANDY: Are you kidding? You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
HELEN: I had the dream again. And I got another call. This time he spoke. He said You and me
ANDY: A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for. <u>Forget</u> it.
HELEN: He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>! I know it was him!
ANDY: He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you. Did you give him an approval?
HELEN: Andy? When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'. You look under the bad. I'm three years old. Call the prison.
HELEN: Oh God. I'm really crazy.
ANDY: When was the last time you washed your hair?
HELEN: Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
ANDY: Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure. And guess what else?
ANDY: Cellulite. What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym. Aerobics with housewives...
HELEN: Andy?
