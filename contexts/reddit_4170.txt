Tips for guys based from my experiences
Before I get destroyed, Let me preface this by saying this is MY opinion. Yes, I realize everyone is different. And yes I know guys prob do the same thing.

1) what girls say and do are different 

“I like when a guy constantly messages me. It shows he cares” (or some variation of this). No, they say this but when it happens they get scared, feel you’re going too fast, you’re clingy. And then they hit you with “I’m not ready. Still healing from blah blah blah.”

2) let the girls be the ones that move the relationship along. Just enjoy dating/sex until she brings it up. 

Don’t ask/say “What are you looking for?” “I really like/love you,” etc. See point #1. Sometimes girls might just want to have sex/fun at the moment but  feel like they can’t say that as an answer. In this case they will end it if they feel you want more. (She might change her mind after a some time being with you).

3) Tex her first (THE FIRST TIME). After that wait for her to initiate the conversations for a little bit.  Otherwise you’ll come off as desperate and she’ll be turned off since you’re an easy target for her. Once things start to get serious then start initiating texts/calls at a reasonable pace. (Also, don’t reply too fast (wait an hour or 3). But this is a per case scenario.

4) Have options! She sure does. This also helps you not obsessed (clingyness) over 1 girl. 

5) have a life outside of her. Hobbies! 

At the end of the day girls like their freedom and they like what they can’t have. If you’re constantly talking to her then she will feel trapped/smothered. 

I’m sure I have other tips but these are the ones on my mind right now. I’ve started having way more success since implementing these! Good luck!
