EDWARD: Want to know something? I don't quite know. I hadn't planned this.
VIVIAN: Do you plan everything?
EDWARD: Always.
VIVIAN: Well, the meter's running, it's your money. Speaking of which, cash'll do. In advance.
EDWARD: Fair enough.
EDWARD: Let's talk some more first.
VIVIAN: Right. So! In town on business?
EDWARD: Uh-huh.
VIVIAN: Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
EDWARD: And why do you say that?
VIVIAN: I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
EDWARD: Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
VIVIAN: I've known a lot of everybody.
