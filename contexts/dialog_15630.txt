MAURICE: I don't know.
ELLEN: I think it's a different place for each person.
MAURICE: Did you have a dream?
ELLEN: I know where my heaven is.
MAURICE: Where?
ELLEN: Pacifica, California.
MAURICE: Why there?
ELLEN: When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year. I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
ELLEN: Maurice?
MAURICE: Yes.
ELLEN: If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
MAURICE: Go to sleep Ellen.
ELLEN: No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
MAURICE: The beach of Pacifica, California.
ELLEN: Good.
