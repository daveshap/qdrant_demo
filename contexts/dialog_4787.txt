SAM: Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
SAM: I think that'll hold it. Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
MRS TERRAIN: My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
SAM: Er, yes ...
MRS TERRAIN: Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
