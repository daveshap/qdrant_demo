JANE: What happened?
TOM: Don't run off -- like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
JANE: He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
TOM: It's not that it's hard. I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
JANE: Okay. Sorry. Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
