CARRIE: ...Pardon?
ADELE: ...I said, I like your hair.
CARRIE: ...Thank you.
BRIAN: Tight fit.
EARLY: Best kind.
BRIAN: Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
EARLY: Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
BRIAN: Brian.
EARLY: Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
