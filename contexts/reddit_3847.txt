Before asking r/Dating for advice, consider talking it out with the person you're dating
Hey r/dating! 

I've been an active user on this sub for a few weeks now and I just want to start off by saying how much I appreciate those on here who offer empathy to those who are getting ghosted, friend-zoned, misled or straight up rejected. It always hurts, but nobody is alone in this and we all feel the same pain at some point or another. So thank you to the "empathizers" out there <3

Here to offer some basic advice, title says it all really. If you're coming to this sub asking for advice on how to understand or interpret something about the person you're dating (what they're looking for, what it means if they text at X frequency, are they dating other people, do they see me as a lover or just a friend, etc.), often times the best solution is simply to talk about it openly with that person. Of course your approach and delivery will matter (e.g. don't come off as assuming they are sleeping with other people because your question might be interpreted as an accusation), but generally I think this advice is more applicable than people might think. I understand that sometimes it's just a question of courage: it's much easier to create a throwaway and ask this sub knowing whatever the responses are, it's not the response you'll necessarily get from the person you're dating. But sooner or later, the only way to get that response is to ask them directly. 

Well that's it. Kudos to everyone who are putting themselves out there despite your past shitty relationships, your rejections, and your insecurities. For the vast majority of us, *dating is* ***not*** *easy*, so for all the would-be lovers out there, keep your chin up and remind yourself that whatever stress you might be feeling when dating someone new, chances are the other person is just as stressed as you! So be open, honest, talk it out and leave the rest to fate.

Good luck to you all!
