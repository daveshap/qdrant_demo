Industry experience > academia experience?
I graduated with a BcS in Chemical Engineering with a minor in Cell and Molecular Biology. Once I graduated I got into Manufacturing in the biotech industry and hate it. It’s been 7 months and I want to quit so bad. I have 2 years of research experience from undergrad in various labs. I’ve been applying for research positions but am constantly getting feedback that my undergrad research isn’t as highly valued as industry research. But how can I get industry research experience without giving the opportunity to learn? Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas?
