Hopes for the Future? 18 year old with Petty Larceny Misdemeanor
To get straight to the point, I made probably the worst mistake of my life and stupidly (but well deserved) ended up with a Class A Petty Larceny Misdemeanor conviction. And worse of all, I was convicted in Virginia, which means I have no hope for expungement. I was just a few months past 18 when this had occured and the literal thought that I had thrown away my life right as it started has brought me to the lowest point in my life. Regardless it was a necessary lesson for me that your actions truly have consequences. To anyone who thinks stealing is worth it, IT IS NOT. 

The only thing I can do now in my position is try my best to minimize the damage this charge will cause me in the future. I know that this subreddit is one of the best to get advice from because you give it in a practical no nonsense type of way. No need for sugar coating here.

A few details about myself, I am currently at school and plan on getting a BS in Information systems and Manangement (Double Major). I chose this due to the many career options it gives you as it mixes buisness with computer science. Is this still a viable option for me due to my situation? What can I do in the present and future to help my chances? If you have any advice I am begging for it. What advice do you have for me regarding applications, and background checks? Again, to anyone who thinks stealing is worth it, IT IS NOT I REPEAT.
