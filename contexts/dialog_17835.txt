TEX: Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
BILLY: But just...
TEX: Just what?
BILLY: I just needed some extra money. I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
BILLY: ...are you with the Consulate?
TEX: Something like that. Cigarette?
TEX: How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
BILLY: Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
TEX: How much did you figure to make?
BILLY: Three, four thousand...I don't know. The guy offered me the hash-- ...it just seemed like easy money.
TEX: Beats working.
BILLY: I was just going to sell it to friends. I'm not a pusher, honest.
TEX: Got a family back there?
BILLY: Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
TEX: What's your father do?
BILLY: He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
TEX: Be tough on 'em.
TEX: Girlfriend?
BILLY: ...She was on the plane.
BILLY: She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
TEX: Lucky girl.
BILLY: Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
TEX: Let's hope so, Billy. Let's sure hope so.
