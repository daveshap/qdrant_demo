JACKIE: The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
LESTER: How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
JACKIE: Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
LESTER: Is that right?
JACKIE: Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
LESTER: Is that right?
JACKIE: So how's Norman?
GEORGE: Great. Who's been doing your hair?
JACKIE: I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
LESTER: George is going to open a shop.
JACKIE: No kidding? Your own shop?
LESTER: George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
GEORGE: Sure.
LESTER: I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
JACKIE: I am?
LESTER: Who were you talking to?
JACKIE: Who do you think I was talking to?
LESTER: My secretary saw you with that boy.
JACKIE: Steve?
LESTER: Whatever his name is, that actor.
JACKIE: Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy. Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
LESTER: Then you were talking to him.
JACKIE: I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
JACKIE: I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
LESTER: I'm not jealous of the dogs.
LESTER: Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
JACKIE: So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
LESTER: Of course not.
JACKIE: That's not very logical, Lester.
