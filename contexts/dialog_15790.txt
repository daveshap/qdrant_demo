SERA: You OK?
BEN: Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
SERA: Thank you. What time is it?
BEN: Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
BEN: I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
SERA: I like hearing you talk. If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
BEN: Do they have drinks?
SERA: I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later. The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
BEN: Is that really what you want to ask me?
SERA: Yes.
BEN: Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
SERA: Very clever.
SERA: First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
BEN: Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
SERA: Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
