RODE: Major.
STEVE: Helmuth.
RODE: Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
STEVE: Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
RODE: It's Dr. Furtw√§ngler's baton, which I stole.
STEVE: The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
RODE: Yes, you remember.
STEVE: How could I forget?
STEVE: Show me.
RODE: Show you?
STEVE: Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
RODE: Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
STEVE: Do it, Helmuth.
