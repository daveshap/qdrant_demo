Failure
I can never do anything right. All I ever do it mess up and fail. So what's the point of trying? 

I'm a pathetic excuse for a human being, I can't do anything. I can't do taxes, my life is in shambles, I'm disgustingly overweight, I'm dumb and boring. I just don't have anything going for me. I'm as empty and hollow as a doll. I'd be better off that way. Because as a human I'm a failure and always will be.
