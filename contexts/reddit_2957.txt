What new skills should I learn to make more $? I currently have a do nothing job that pays 50K
Title says it all, this is a throwaway. I have a do nothing job right now where I MAYBE get 5 hours of work a day doing web design, and a little coding. Mostly I make additions/edits to people’s websites who pay my company to build/host it. This pays 50K. I have so much extra time to learn a new skill or even take on part time work that I can do on the computer. If you have any advice on what I should be doing or learning that would be amazing because I really don’t know. Maybe certificates, a new program language, or even part time work that corresponds with what I do now? Btw I’m 24, but main goal here is to learn something that’ll make me more $. 

Past work includes: 
1.) tech sales
2.) web design
3.) management 
4.) customer service
