Anxiety is ruining my life and relationships and IDK how to stop it.
Background information, I'm 20 years old in 3rd year university for mechanical engineering. 

For the last two years I have had severe anxiety that stems from two things; A really bad ex who lied to me and manipulated me to the point where I was cheated on twice. Track and Field is also my life and when I get injured for long periods of time I go into a deep depression. 

Recently I've been feeling terribly anxious. My resting heart rate is so god damn high because I'm worrying about everything, my relationships, my classes and my job. I can't even focus on class at this point because I'm so distracted and I want to cry so much. Nothing my psychologist does helps me, I hate my life because I'm always like this. I never used to be and I want to just go back to normal. I miss not having anxiety and being able to relax. I miss running T&F, I miss having someone to make me a better person. I'm so heartbroken with my life going down the drain and Idc anymore. IDK what to do.  I can't sleep at night anymore, I'm so exhausted and done. I can't do it anymore. 

Idk why I'm posting this because nothing is going to help.
