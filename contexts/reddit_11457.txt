My wife isn't coming home again tonight.
My wife is staying at her friends house for the third night in a row. We haven't slept in the same bed for what feels like months. She says she needs space to figure things out.

It feels like the harder I fight to get her back the more she resents me.

I never thought my marriage could end up like this.

It just all feels so hopeless right now.

Hope everyone else is having an alright night.
