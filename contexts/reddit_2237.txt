PSA for procrastinators
You may have less time than you think.

In a few weeks we're going to start seeing the posts.  "Does the deadline of November 1st mean midnight or 12:59:59? What time zone is that deadline?"  I know, I'm a procrastinator too.  You're going to want to squeeze out every second possible before submitting those applications. (and it usually means 11:59:59 in the time zone where the college is located)

Do yourself a favor and pretend the deadline is a day or two earlier though.  You may have less time than you think.

It didn't happen last year, but in the past the Common App has been swamped on deadline day and had outages and severe lag.  Some people say there were DDOS attacks two years ago, but it's hard to distinguish between DDOS attacks and a company just not having a robust enough server to handle additional load.  Be that as it may, this forum was filled with anguish as people watched their chance to submit an application in the early round slip away with 'unable to connect' and the spinning hourglass/rainbow circle.

Even if the Common App manages to handle the load, there are local outages that can hit you.  Transformers blow.  This time of year we can have windstorms and in the north we can get early snow.  Internet access dies at random for someone every year.

Don't let that happen to you.  Pretend that the deadline is October 30.

Because while haunted houses and FX zombie makeup can be scary, a complete lack of wifi signals on Halloween night when your application is due in the next hour is where you experience real fear.
