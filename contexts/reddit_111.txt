These people keep fucking patting my head
So everyday people keep patting my head like I'm some cute little dog or pet.  You know how embarrassing that is for a guy?  People literally ask if they can pat my head or hug me.  In the middle of class.  Were like working on some project and it's like dead silent.  This girl across from me asks if she can touch me.  Like what?  The fucking teacher looked at me.  I'm not some artifact at a museum that you can touch.  Is there anyway I can make them stop?
