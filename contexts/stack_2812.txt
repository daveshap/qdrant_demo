How does tensile loading and shear stress contribute to gravity? Both, tensile loading and shear stress are represented in the Stress-Energy Tensor and hence are sources of gravity. As I understand it (please correct if wrong) tensile loading implies forces perpenticular to the surface, so that e.g. x-momentum flows in the x-direction across the unit surface. The same direction means that $T^{11}$ is pressure (negative or positiv depending on tension or compression). Whereas the non-diagonal elements are shear stress in case the force parallel to the surface.In the FRW context negative pressure acts as repulsive gravity. Regarding a solid body, does negative pressure decrease the effective gravitational mass?Can the non-diagonal shear stress components be negativ and positiv? What would a good example to show that, e.g. the deformation of a elastic ball if a gravitational wave passes by?How does shear stress depending on it\u2018s sign act on gravity (in the sense of attractive vs. repulsive)?Thanks
