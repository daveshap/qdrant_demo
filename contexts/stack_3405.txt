What part do the Protoss play in the \u201cAscension\u201d? And if none, doesn't that make Terrans \u201cpure of form\u201d instead? In StarCraft 2, the \u201cInfinite Cycle\u201d which the Xel'naga initiate is described as the coming together of \u201cpurity of essence\u201d (ostensibly the Zerg) and \u201cpurity of form\u201d (ostensibly the Protoss), to ascend as Xel'naga.From the cinematics:<blockquote>  ... and one pure of form - a being capable of vast psionic potential, able to house the essence of a Xel'naga.</blockquote>and<blockquote>  Then the elders among them will give their lives to bestow their essence, and pure of form and pure of essence will be reborn as Xel'naga.</blockquote>And yes, the Protoss tag along and moreover are instrumental to the happenings in the Legacy of the Void.But when it comes to ascension, it seems there is no Protoss part in it. The essence of the Xel'naga is bestowed onto the Zerg and Terrans, but not the Protoss.Wouldn't that make Terrans the representatives of \u201cpurity of form\u201d? After all Kerrigan retains a strongly human form, and is capable of \u201cvast psionic potential\u201d on account of Terran birth and ghost training.Omission or interesting turn of the story?
