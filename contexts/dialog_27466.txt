12-YEAR-OLD DANNY: There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
RAV ZINGESSER: No one follows that midrash.
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY: I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
RAV ZINGESSER: Watch your language....
12-YEAR-OLD DANNY: I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
