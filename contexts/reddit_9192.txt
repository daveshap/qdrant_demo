I’m so done with being told to walk or bike to work.
No, I cannot and will not walk or bike to my job. Why?

-	The DRIVE alone to work is 30 minutes. 
-	Move closer? Sure, if I want to pay $1200 for a studio.
-	There are no true safe places to walk or bike in my area. Drivers do not give a fuck.
-	While my job is casual, I need to maintain a professional appearance. We do not have showers for me to scrub away the stink and sweat from trying to walk/bike across town and back daily.
-	I do not work in a close, tight, NYC style city. Quit assuming that I do, or that I should immediately move to such a place. I live further from the city to save on rent. Also, my job isn’t even IN the city.
-	MY CITY IS SURROUNDED BY WATER AND WE TRAVERSE IT BY BRIDGES. MOST OF WHICH DO NOT HAVE BIKE LANES. 
-	Too lazy, you say? I walked to all of my college classes no problem. Why? Because they were only a few miles apart. Why am I not walking to work? Because the walk could actually cause me medical problems, especially with how hot it gets here. Nobody is hoofing it to work when the drive is already 30+ minutes. I’m glad you’re able to channel your inner Usain Bolt during the week, but I’m not quite as fit as you are.
-	Public transportation in some areas does not exist outside of the city area. People at work have said that if the bus ran through our individual towns and cities all the way to work, they’d happily take it. But it doesn’t. Stop assuming we’re making excuses. 

I see these suggestions in money saving articles all the time and I can’t help but think that some of these people have never lived outside of a big close knit city.
