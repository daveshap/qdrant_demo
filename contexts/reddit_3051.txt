How do you control anxiety?
So, my background is that I graduated back in June 2017. Joined as Business Analyst at a financial services firm, worked for 10 months and the left to join an old professor of mine as a Research Intern for a year to get an in-depth look at the analytics domain.

Now that the internship is ending, I am job hunting. I am in the process for some, applying to many. However, I have these "anxiety attacks" ( is that even a word?) . I feel sad, angry, anxious, deeply troubled about the future, all at the same time.

How do you guys deal with this? Any suggestions? What would you have done if you were me?
