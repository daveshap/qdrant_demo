HARRY: Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
BABE BROTHER: It is just a regular card.
HARRY: Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere.
BABE BROTHER: Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?
SUZIE: Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
