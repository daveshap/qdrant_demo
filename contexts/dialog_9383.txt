GONZO: You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
DUKE: Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
GONZO: You cheap honky sonofabitch...
DUKE: Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
GONZO: The cops?
DUKE: There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
GONZO: Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious.
