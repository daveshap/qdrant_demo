How can be various frequencies in one place? How can we receive different radio shows in one place, they are coded in phase or frequency or amplitude of electromagnetic waves, but shouldnt elecreomagnetic waves interact each other, and all electric and magnetic vectors superpose, and in one point or space just have one electromagnetic wave with addition of several EMWs?
