ELIZABETH: He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
LENA: It's fine.
ELIZABETH: Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
BARRY: I don't know.
LENA: Hi.
BARRY: Hi.
LENA: Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
BARRY: Yes I do.
ELIZABETH: This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
BARRY: Yeah I can't.
ELIZABETH: Why?
BARRY: I have work, I can't leave.
ELIZABETH: Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
BARRY: I'm sorry.
LENA: It's ok. That's alright.
ELIZABETH: Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
BARRY: It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
LANCE: WHICH?
BARRY: ...I'll tell you later.
