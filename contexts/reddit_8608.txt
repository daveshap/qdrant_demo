Has Israel exposed nuclear deal violations by Iran?
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently [gave a presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qBt4tSCALA) where he made many accusations against Iran.

[Here is a transcript of the speech for precision and easy access to quotes.](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/full-text-netanyahu-s-reveals-iran-s-atomic-archive-in-speech-1.6045556)

In response, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/991031933823012865) to call the accusations "a rehash of old allegations already dealt with by the IAEA to 'nix' the deal." 

There are so many directions this discussion could lead, but in the end the most important question seems to be whether or not Iran has violated their part of the Joint Comprehensive plan of action. [The text of the JCPA can be found here](https://www.state.gov/e/eb/tfs/spi/iran/jcpoa/). 

So there they are, Netenyahu's accusations and the deal itself. Do the documents presented by Netanyahu show any specific violation of the JCPOA?
