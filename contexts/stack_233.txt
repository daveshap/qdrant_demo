After installing High Sierra, preferences do not stick: PhotoShop images default to open in Preview Since I \"upgraded\" to High Sierra, the text program (Tex-Edit Plus, v14.10.4) always reverts to the default preferences of opening two windows I do not want open: \"Enable Quartz anti-aliased text at startup\" and \"Enable TSM (Text Services Manager) at startup\" windows. The DOC preferences open text at 10 points, and in the Save preferences not including the .txt extension when saving files. I then must manually change the preferences since I use this program every day. Mac used to save my preferences; it apparently no longer does and does not explain how to fix this.Also, I am a graphic designer and Use Adobe Photoshop all the time, and when I make a screenshot of something, or even have a .psd file in layers, High Sierra now often still reverts to opening Photoshop files in Preview. The ONLY time I use Preview is if I want to reduce the file size of a created PDF file. I Get Info for the image, and when I set the default app (it shows Preview) I use the down arrow for other apps and it doesn't even show Photoshop. I have to search for it, tell it to use Photoshop, and then to do this for all similar files. On average, about 10 minutes later it STILL opens Photoshop files I am working on in Preview again.These little glitches in High Sierra make it time-consuming to do the exact same work I did before getting High Sierra. Is there any way both of these problems could be fixed so I don't spend time telling high sierra over and over again how things should work on my computer?
