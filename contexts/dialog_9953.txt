CREATURE: Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
VICTOR: There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
CREATURE: What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out? Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
VICTOR: Materials. Nothing more.
CREATURE: You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
CREATURE: In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart? And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
VICTOR: Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
CREATURE: Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these? Who am I?
VICTOR: I don't know.
CREATURE: Then perhaps I believe in evil after all.
VICTOR: What can I do?
CREATURE: There is something I want. A friend.
VICTOR: Friend?
CREATURE: A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
VICTOR: Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
CREATURE: I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours. You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
VICTOR: And if I consent?
CREATURE: We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together. No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
CREATURE: Soon?
VICTOR: Yes. I want this over and done with.
CREATURE: I'll be waiting. And watching.
ELIZABETH: I thought I'd never see you again!
VICTOR: I'm all right. I'm safe,
HENRY: What happened up there?
VICTOR: I didn't find what I was looking for.
