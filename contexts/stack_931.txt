skype not in software centre ubuntu 14.04 I looked at answers for downloading skype and they all seem to be a bit dated.  can anyone tell me what exactly I should do to download the latest version of skype?I have an ubuntu 14.04, have cleaned it, updated it, etc., and skype does not work so I purged it.  but skype is not in the software centre even though the canonical partners are all turned on.from where exactly should I download skype?
