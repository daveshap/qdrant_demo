ALVY: M'hm.
ROB: I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.

ALVY: I think he has a little thing for Annie.
ROB: Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
ALVY: Where?
ROB: The one with the V.P.L.
ALVY: V.P.L.?
ROB: Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.

ALVY: I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
