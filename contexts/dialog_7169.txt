CHICO: Please....shoot me.
RHODES: And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
RHODES: After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
CHICO: NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
RHODES: I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
CHICO: Two of us...only two of us...me...and him.
RHODES: I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
CHICO: The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
RHODES: Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
CHICO: There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
RHODES: Then why did you come here?
CHICO: To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
RHODES: How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
CHICO: Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
RHODES: Where are you going, Tyler?
TOBY: My...detail"
RHODES: No time for that. I'll take care of them.
TOBY: Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
RHODES: I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
