Don’t support Nickelodeon ever again.
Everyone, This is very important. Please listen.  

As some of you might be aware, a spinoff series of SpongeBob SquarePants known as “Kamp Koral” is supposedly coming to fruition soon. Whatever you do, **DO NOT SUPPORT IT.** Don’t watch it, don’t promote it, don’t recommend it to anyone. This is spitting in the face of late Stephen Hillenburg (the creator of SBSQ), whom Nickelodeon *waited for to die* in order to go against his wishes. 

I’m only drawing attention to this to warn you all. This is disguised as something innocent, but it’s so indescribably fucked up. 
Don’t support Nickelodeon in general, if you can help it. 
Thanks for taking the time to read.

Second edit: Here's the petition to get Kamp Koral canceled!: https://www.change.org/p/nickelodeon-cancel-the-spongebob-spin-off-kamp-koral?utm_content=cl_sharecopy_16023449_en-US%3Av4&recruiter=833116012&recruited_by_id=0c672d50-c77c-11e7-87b1-85b4f46bab19&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=copylink&utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&share_bandit_exp=initial-16023449-en-US&share_bandit_var=v0

Third edit: Since some of you STILL think this is bullshit, here's Paul Tibbit's Twitter: https://twitter.com/paultibbitt . And to clarify, if it wasn't obvious enough already, NO, he is NOT on board with this thing airing, either.

Fourth edit: No, the image of Spongebob pasted onto Camp Lazlo is not the official thing. That's called a joke. This show really is supposed to be released.
