THE RAT: So... pretty nice house you've got here.
STACY: Thanks. So... What do you want to do?
THE RAT: I don't know.
STACY: Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
THE RAT: Sure.
STACY: This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
THE RAT: Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
