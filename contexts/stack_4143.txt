Is it possible to re enter to UK after get refused for the first time for visa-free passport holder? I got refused for the first time to enter the UK as what the UK immigration had these points out during my interview. I had no ticket to embark from UK (which I told them that I will decide it once my sister had graduate on January 2019)They said my financial is not stable (as I told them that my parents going to support and transfer the money as I reached UK)My intention to visit UK is not clear (as I told them that I will stay with my sister for 3-4 months and we will go travel in a few places)And for now, I had bought a ticket to go out from UK (to Cologne, for my next Europe trip before I go back to my home), I have 5000\u00a3, and I\u2019m staying with my girlfriend for a month (apartment has been paid in full, which I have the tenancy agreement document ), my sister graduation invitation, my parents return flight ticket. What should I prepare to go in UK tomorrow?
