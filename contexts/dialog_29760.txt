CLARENCE: Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
CLIFF: You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this - - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
CLIFF: What do you want from me?
CLARENCE: What?
CLIFF: Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
CLARENCE: Do you still have friends on the force?
CLIFF: Yes, I still have friends on the force.
CLARENCE: Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on. Daddy?
CLIFF: What makes you think I could do that?
CLARENCE: You were a cop.
CLIFF: What makes you think I would do that?
CLARENCE: I'm your son.
CLIFF: You got it all worked out, don't you?
CLARENCE: Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always OK"
ALABAMA: The forager's back.
CLARENCE: Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
ALABAMA: I didn't get any chicken.
CLARENCE: How come?
ALABAMA: It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
CLIFF: It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
WILSON: What about him?
CLIFF: Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
WILSON: Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
CLIFF: Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
WILSON: McTeague.
CLIFF: I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
WILSON: I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
CLIFF: You and Robin moved?
WILSON: Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
CLIFF: They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
CLARENCE: Do tell. Why drug related?
CLIFF: Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
CLARENCE: No shit?
CLIFF: Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
CLARENCE: Nope.
CLIFF: If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
CLARENCE: Who is he?
CLIFF: Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
CLARENCE: That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
CLIFF: Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
CLARENCE: Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
CLIFF: I got some money I can give you -
CLARENCE: Keep it.
CLIFF: Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
CLARENCE: We do make a cute couple, don't we?
CLIFF: Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around. I love you son.
