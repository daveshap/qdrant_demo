MELVIN: Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
CAROL: Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
MELVIN: Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
MELVIN: Good-bye. Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
SIMON: Another place where?
MELVIN: Does it matter?
CAROL: I don't want to hear that music right now.
MELVIN: What do you mean? You said you liked it.
CAROL: I don't.
MELVIN: This one has a special meaning.
CAROL: It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
MELVIN: Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
CAROL: I'll take a bus.
MELVIN: I'll take you... why not?
CAROL: I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself. You have my number.
SIMON: I love you... Let him take you home.
CAROL: Don't want to. I love you.
