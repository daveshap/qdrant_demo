ELLIE: Honey. You got him.
MIKE: I don't know that Ellie. He might get out. Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
ELLIE: She's got to identify him.
MIKE: Why?
ELLIE: Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals. I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
MIKE: I think -- she's crazy.
ELLIE: I'd identify him.
MIKE: I might stop you.
ELLIE: Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
MIKE: No! No! I'm sorry. Ninety-seven five right?
ELLIE: Where'd you get the tie?
MIKE: Bought it.
ELLIE: It's not your taste.
MIKE: What did she say the down payment was?
MIKE: She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
ELLIE: She took you shopping for a tie?
MIKE: I had to follow her to a store.
ELLIE: What's wrong with your paisley tie?
MIKE: Ellie, it was a formal party...
ELLIE: Excuse me! You went to a party with her?
MIKE: I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
ELLIE: I know you're her bodyguard. Did she buy it or did you?
MIKE: She bought it.
ELLIE: Why?
MIKE: I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
