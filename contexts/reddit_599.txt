Without purpose
Hi there! I'm 18F. In 5 month I have my high school graduation with a big exam. I don't have dreams or something to live for, only my sister who is pregnant (Yay). I got these stupid disease, Lupus for life and I think that this made me give up living. It's not that dangerous for me, but I wasn't looking up to future before being diagnosed. I got no friends, I like being lonely, I have a boyfriend who could be happy without me. Don't think I'm gonna kill myself, I'm a chicken, I just need an advice to get out from this sad circle. Thank you!
