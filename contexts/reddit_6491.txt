How is it like working for Amazon, Google and Microsoft?
Genuinely curious because one of my cousins got into Amazon and she is having an extremely difficult time with no trainings at all. She is getting pressurised on a daily basis having insinuations of getting fired if she doesn't ramp up quickly. Her work also depends on quite a few people who has no trust in her since she is new. I really believed these companies are a good place to work, but I guess I am wrong? Anyone can shed a light on this?
