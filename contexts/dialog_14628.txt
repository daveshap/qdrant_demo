KATHRYN: Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
BRIAN: I'm only walking him. You caught him. You have to be exhausted.
KATHRYN: Go on, you're tired.
BRIAN: No, I'm fine, thanks.
PHILIP: How's sleeping beauty?
KATHRYN: Still sleeping.
PHILIP: Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
KATHRYN: Should be coming out of it soon.
PHILIP: Just watch it when he does.
