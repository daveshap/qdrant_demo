TrueSTUDIO look and feel I have used Keil uVision and Microchip MPLABX IDE's a lot for various MCUs. Now starting to use Atollic TrueSTUDIO for STM32 MCUs.But even after spending many weeks on trueSTUDIO and building many small example codes in it.. i still do not feel comfortable as it was in the other 2 IDEs mentioned above. It was more easy to see the code and focus on it in those IDE's while the trueSTUDIO has so many views on the window that keeps you distracting and its difficult to keep focus on the code..Can anyone suggest how to make the look and feel of trueSTUDIO simple?Someone told me that it's possible to use some other editor like Notepad++ for code writing and the compiler, linker etc toolchain from the trueSTUDIO. Is it advisable and how can that be done?
