What are some applications of unsupervised HMMs? Supervised HMMs can be applied to many problems like POS tagging and OCR (optical character recognition).I've learned that HMMs can be trained unsupervisedly using EM (Baum-Welch algorithm), what are some example applications of this unsupervised approach?
