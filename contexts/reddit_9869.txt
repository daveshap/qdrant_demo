I have an interview! What should I expect?
I have an interview next week to be a PT Advisor in a college's TRiO department. I have been trying to land this position for a long time, so I want to be 100% prepared. What kind of questions should I expect at this interview? 

Just some background-- I am coming from K-12 Education. I applied to be an Academic Advisor at several colleges while I was in my last semester of undergrad. Since I had no luck, I decided I would give high school teaching a try while I worked towards getting hired by a college eventually. While working in the high schools, I knew pretty quickly that it wasn't the right field for me (but did not have any luck getting interviews at colleges, so I stayed in high schools). I worked at 3 schools in 3 1/2 years, and the reason for my movement is because I was trying to find a good fit in a field that was a bad fit. Just in case this movement is addressed during the interview, I would really like to tell them the honest truth-- that I've always wanted to work in Higher Education and that my being unhappy in my previous field is what caused me to not to stay in one place. In your opinion, do you think this honesty would hurt my chances? 

Thanks in advance!!
