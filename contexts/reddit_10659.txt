I admitted that I was suicidal to my boss, and his response resulted in cutting myself.
I, a 23 year old female, am a teacher, rejected multiple times, but now teach yet again. Worded that pretty stupidly but... anyways.

I was reported by some of my co-workers that I have been doing my job poorly. In what way, I don't know. Maybe the pauses in between sentences, dragging out words, or arriving to the classroom 15 minutes late. I went to the principal's office and asked what exactly is preventing my potential. Told him instantly about my depression, due to some advice given to me in this website. He said that I'm faking it for an excuse to slack, or that I'm looking for attention. I just abruptly left.

It reminded me of how cruel and heartless people can be, and how worthless I am in the grand scheme of things. One thing lead to another and... read title.

This abyss keeps getting deeper and deeper.
