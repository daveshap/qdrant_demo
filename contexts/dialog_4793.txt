SAM: Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
JILL: Where are you going?
SAM: I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
JILL: Don't do anything silly.
SAM: Thanks for the vote of confidence.
JILL: Take care.
SAM: Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
PORTER: I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
SAM: And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
PORTER: I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
SAM: Thank you, Dawson.
