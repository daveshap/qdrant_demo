Degree in Statistics or Computer Science/Information Technology?
This is my last year in high school. That means my final exams, which are going to grant me the opportunity to become a university student, are a few days away. I'm confident I'll do well, but I have another problem. After evaluating my preferences and my strengths, my two options for a degree are Statistics and IT. However I haven't yet decided which one to follow. I have been involved with computers and relative technology for years, so I think this one would be more enjoyable for me. However, I have to taki into account job opportunities and future growth, because I won't be able to enjoy my job if I'm unemployed. You people obviously can't advise me on what I would love more, but I'm hoping you can give me some opinions such as which of the two would give me more opportunities, would make it easier to advance as a professional or anything else you think would be valuable. Thanks in advance.
