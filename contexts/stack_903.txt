Problem with Windows Boot Manager/BIOS in dual boot PC model- Lenovo Ideapad 300OS- Windows 10 dual booted with Ubuntu 18.04I am not able to start windows or view grub menu or  see Lenovo logo(which was visible earlier) after one fine day I put my Windows to sleep. Sleep mode was working perfectly fine earlier.Now only Ubuntu 18.04 is starting and grub menu is not visible, also windows is not able to start properly. The display is black until Ubuntu loads.How can I recover windows and bios.When grub is updated in terminal it successfully detects all OS.
