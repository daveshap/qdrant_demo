The NFL's new policy on protests during the national anthem. Is it legal? Is it appropriate? Are there better alternatives?
Silent political protests while the national anthem is being played prior to US football games [has been a topic of discussion for the last couple years.](https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/25/17391410/nfl-anthem-policy-timeline-colin-kaepernick) Some [support](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/throngs-declare-their-support-for-colin-kaepernick-outside-nfl-headquarters_us_599e8c26e4b06d67e3353f8d) the protests, while others have reacted negatively, including comments up to the level of the [US president](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/912664574461120512?lang=en).

The National Football League (NFL) recently issued [new rules regarding athlete behavior during the national anthem,](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/23582533/nfl-owners-approve-new-national-anthem-policy) specifically requiring present athletes to stand while it's being played, but allowing those who object to remain in the locker room until the anthem concludes. There are fines associated with violations of these rules.

Political protest is a [Constitutionally guaranteed right in the US,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) but many [legal experts support the view](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/25/16360580/nfl-donald-trump-national-anthem-protest) that the NFL, as a private organization, may set its own workplace rules, even if they limit expression. 

On the other hand, there are some interesting counterarguments.

> Last month, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled in *Beckman v. Chicago Bear Football Club* that a Green Bay Packers fan [may proceed with his First Amendment lawsuit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcedelman/2018/05/02/recent-court-decision-makes-it-riskier-for-nfl-teams-to-punish-protesting-players/#354cee8948d8) against the Chicago Bears organization after the Bears refused to allow him to attend an on-field event while dressed in Packers clothing. The court noted that the fan may have a right to "free speech" within Soldier Field based on an operating agreement that gave both the Chicago Bears football club and the Chicago Park District shared control over speech in the **publicly-funded football stadium.** (emphasis added)

[Many NFL stadiums are publicly funded.](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/nfl-new-stadiums-public-funding-how-much-atlanta-san-diego-minnesota-los-angeles-033116)

And Benjamin Sachs, a Harvard professor of labor and industry, [calls the ban "flatly illegal"](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/25/17394422/nfl-knee-kneeling-labor-law-kaepernick-free-speech-protest-owners) on a number of different grounds, including the league's failure to discuss the new rules with the player's union before changing the terms of employment, the restriction it imposes on the employees' right to engage in a collective action, and the limitations it introduces on protected free speech, based on either State constitutions, or Federally, because of the involvement of the US President in the dispute.

So, the first question is, based on the above, whether the NFL's new policy is legal.

Moving beyond that, is the ban an appropriate measure for the league to take? President Trump expressed his support for the rule and strongly implied that it didn't go far enough:

> I don’t think people should be staying in the locker rooms, but still I think it’s good. You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or
you shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.

Others argue that in the US, [the act of protest itself is patriotic.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-anthem-nfl-protest-patriotism-20180524-story.html) Is there room for dissent over policy at a public event put on by a private organization?

And finally, if the NFL's new policy isn't the right one, what would be better? Have alternative approaches been proposed that would allow the league to respond to the desires of its fans while also honoring the laws and traditions of the country?
