MARGE: Uh-huh.
WOMAN: We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
MARGE: And his wife?
WOMAN: She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
MARGE: Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
WOMAN: His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
MARGE: Oh, my.
WOMAN: And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
MARGE: Boy, this thing is really... geez.
WOMAN: Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
MARGE: Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
DETECTIVE SIBERT: Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
MARGE: End a April.
DETECTIVE SIBERT: Any others?
MARGE: This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
DETECTIVE SIBERT: That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
MARGE: Oh, yah, I know that!
DETECTIVE SIBERT: They can really take over, that's for sure.
MARGE: You have children?
DETECTIVE SIBERT: I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
MARGE: Oh, now he's adorable.
DETECTIVE SIBERT: He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
MARGE: Oh, he's adorable.
DETECTIVE SIBERT: Yah, he -
MARGE: Where'd you get him that parka?
DETECTIVE SIBERT: Both of these.
MARGE: Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
DETECTIVE SIBERT: Oh, don't be silly.
MARGE: Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
DETECTIVE SIBERT: Oh, don't be silly.
