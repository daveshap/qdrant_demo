I want to go into forensics, or be a blood spatter analysis, what grade in science do I need, and what colleges do I go to for this?
I’m 14, and I’m the eighth grade. I know I need a good grade in science, but I don’t know what types of colleges to go to for when I’m ready. Any help? I can answer any questions related

UPDATE: I spoke to my science teacher, and there is actually a science class in my high school dedicated to forensics. I think I know my career now.
