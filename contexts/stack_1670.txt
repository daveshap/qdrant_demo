Which replacement Zener Diode should I use? I am repairing a television power supply and have found a couple Zener Diodes that are bad. The service manual gives only a part number of VZMTZJ30DT. I have searched online for hours and cannot find any information on this component. Any help would be great.I am working on a Panasonic power supply ETX2MM-806-AEL, and the component location is ZD501 and ZD503.
