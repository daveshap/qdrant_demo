Getting a good job without a degree
So my husband has been a chef for about 10 years and now wants to leave this job for one with better hours and a better career path.

Only problem is that he doesnt have a degree and his GCSEs arent great. As he was dyslexic he didnt get much help at school and subsequently had a bad experience with learning so wont go back to college (I know, I've tried to convince him but he wont go, we would struggle financially if he did this plus the courses would cost nearly 1.2k) main ones he is missing are maths and english, he can read and write well and his maths is better than mine and I got a B at GCSE.

So my question is, are there any tips for getting in at a good job/company without having great qualification? Loads of jobs ask for minimum of grade C maths and English, or require degree level education even if they havent specified what degree they want! 

It's very disheartening for him
