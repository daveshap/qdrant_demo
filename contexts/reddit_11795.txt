One of those "what am I even doing here" days.
I don't feel any drive or sense of purpose. Nothing calling to me. I don't know what I want to do, and I don't feel like it has much to do with being young. I don't see it ever just coming to me.

Should I be taking more steps to try to find my purpose? Myself? Am I spending too much time with simple pleasures?

I just feel detached from my surroundings. I don't see any point today.

But the numbness of the comfort zone that is my life can be, well, comforting, until I start thinking about it again. I go back to being scared to change anything.

I don't feel fulfilled, but I don't know what would make me feel fulfilled either. I'm stuck being undriven, unsatisfied, and pointless.
