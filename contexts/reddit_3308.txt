Looking for a new, light-hearted career that won’t crush my soul...any advice for me?
TL;DR at the end. 

So, a bit of context to my title: I graduated university with a degree in criminology and psychology. I have a real curiosity about the human psyche, supporting our vulnerable and justice. 

After graduation, I took the first job I could get - investigating and intervening in cases of child abuse and neglect. It was soul crushing to say the least. I quickly burn-out and moved on to a role I feel is more suited to my studies. 

At the moment I work in a local level court, providing case management for people who are in the community awaiting sentencing. Essentially, my job involves supporting people experiencing things like drug addiction, mental illness, homelessness, and trauma. It’s a rewarding, but equally soul crushing and stressful job. I see a lot of the dark side of society and frankly, it’s taking a toll on me. 

As a result of all the downtime from COVID-19, I’ve realised my work is making me anxious and depressed, and that maybe, this line of work isn’t for me at all. Ideally I want to do something that makes me happy; or at least, doesn’t fill me with dread on a Sunday night. 

The decision feels easy but I’m also trapped - my current salary is amazing and I have a debt as a result of my studies. I live in Australia so I’m not worried about the financial impact of the debt, just the sense of guilt that I went and racked up a debt for a career I will ultimately not be pursuing. 

I guess my question is - does anyone actually work a job that makes them happy? Where they feel positive and aren’t impacted by all the suffering in the world on a day to day basis? 

TL;DR : I’m completely burnt-out from my work with vulnerable people in awful traumatic situations. I need a job that makes me smile and doesn’t bring me down. Send help.
