RAID mode on XPS 9550 Recently I got a Dell XPS 9550 and have gotten Ubuntu to run on on it when I put the ssd in AHCI mode. However, I was wondering if it is possible to get ubuntu to detect the ssd when in raid mode which uses Intel RST I believe. By default using the installer bundled with ubuntu it can not detect the ssd using the raid utility built into the installer. Apparently, Intel RST is compatible with linux through mdadm, but I have yet to figure out how to get this to work. I was curious if anyone know how to use mdadm to be able to install ubuntu in raid mode and if not are there any real advantages of Raid mode over AHCI? Thank you in advance for any help!
