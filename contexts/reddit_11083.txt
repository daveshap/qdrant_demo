Goodbye, Reddit. I have to deactivate my account.
But first, a rant on online privacy.

As minors, we are legally entitled to almost zero privacy from our parents. This year, I've spent countless time trying to keep my activities private and secure from the internet at large, adding two factor to all of my accounts, never attaching social media to my name, only for my parents to ask for all of my passwords.

Oh, and I have to turn off all my two factor authentication, too.

So why did I bother in the first place?

Because I wanted something that I alone owned. It has always felt like my parents own my entire life, except for my internet use. The internet, for me, felt like the one place where I could be my own person and have my own space. Nope. Not anymore. My parents need all of my passwords.

The reason I'm deleting this account is that my parents are scared social media is full of rapists and hackers, and Reddit is DaNgErOuS, not a place to find a like minded community that shares your thoughts, feelings, and frustrations.

Enjoy the rest of your time here for me. Enjoy your privacy, it may not last.
