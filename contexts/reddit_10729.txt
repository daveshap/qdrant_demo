I'm sick and tired of people telling me "you're too young to be depressed"
I am 11 years old. My dad committed suicide when I was 8. As he was a stay-at-home dad, I had so much experience with playing with him and talking in general. I haven't really talked to many people or made relationships with anyone following that event. Seemingly every week some adult is telling me that I'm too young to be depressed, like damn when did they make an age cap. I've thought about suicide for the last 3 years but have only tried once, which failed bad, but recently with people comparing depression to my age constantly it makes me want to try again.

thanks for reading

Edits: hey guys, I just want to thank you all so much for the 30+ positive messages you have sent me. I never expected I would get more help in under 24 hours than I ever had in 3 years. As much as this makes me happy, it also comes to my concern s that there are some horrible people browsing this Reddit. I have received multiple messages telling me to do certain things to myself. Here is an example: https://imgur.com/gallery/tdYcb
