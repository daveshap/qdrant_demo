A.M.A.: Kasandrea Sereno - June 16, 2014 (a.k.a. @kasandreasereno on Twitter)
Hi Everyone! My name is Kasandrea and I am currently an undergrad academic & living learning community advisor at a large research university. Before this I have worked in the dean of student's office and undergraduate admissions, with brief layovers in student activities, disability services and orientation. I have been a chapter advisor for a national fraternity, as well as a first year experience course teacher. I have an MBA and an M.Ed, and really dig the combination of business and higher ed. 
I recently started a company that helps high-schoolers and their families navigate the admissions and college experience, as well as help colleges improve their programs for this population.  I also get to speak on social media topics including teaching small business owners how to create and execute social strategy and how college students can use social media to market themselves and land a job (hoping to have a book coming out later this year!).  

I am particularly fond of vanilla lattes, Chipotle, and traveling although not necessarily in that order. You can check out my blog and links at http://kasandreasereno.com 

So that's me in a nutshell, what more can tell you? Ask away!
