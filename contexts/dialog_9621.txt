TRAUTMAN: Take your time.
KIRKHILL: Look, Colonel... we're all adults here. This is a war. A very quiet, very intense war. People get sacrificed.
TRAUTMAN: Not my people.
TRAUTMAN: But you're right... some people do get sacrificed. Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
KIRKHILL: You think I'm some whacko? I like to hurt people? I'm doing a job here. If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right? So I follow directives... I do what I'm told. It's simple. If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
TRAUTMAN: Don't dance me, Kirkhill. You'll be walking funny.
KIRKHILL: Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything. We thought that camp was empty.
TRAUTMAN: This mission was a scam from the word go?
KIRKHILL: Word came down... they wanted an answer. And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs. But it had to look good. Best effort. The whole dog-and-pony show.
TRAUTMAN: Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
KIRKHILL: It was clean. Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it. He gets himself caught he's a private citizen
TRAUTMAN: Terminate with extreme prejudice.""
KIRKHILL: That's a crock. We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public? The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom. Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back. That's billion, Colonel. With a B". For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years? A pain in the ass to everybody? No way. There's no way."
TRAUTMAN: So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
KIRKHILL: Of course not. You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
