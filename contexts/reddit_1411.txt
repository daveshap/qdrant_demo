I got my first 'real' job and survived my first day--8 hours--without letting my panic take control.
Yesterday was a giant victory for me. I recently got a job at a pet store I had wanted so badly and got through my first day without having a panic attack. I'd been putting off getting a better job to replace the 'job' I had before--working 2-8 hours a week at my mom's store for about 3 years now. I can actually start saving money and hopefully move forward with my life once I have some savings. I work again today but only for 4 1/2 hours. I mostly watch and clean up after a couple dozen puppies, and even through all the poop and smells I really love interacting with them all. For the first time in years I feel like I'm making true progress past my anxiety and depression and it feels empowering. Just wanted to share c:
