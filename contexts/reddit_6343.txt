After 8 months of unemployment, with close to no responses from companies I've applied for, I finally got an interview for a job. One week after my interview, I receive an email saying I was the perfect candidate and that I'm hired!
I know 8 months is nothing compared to what other people have gone through. But to me it felt like forever. And the shame of it was really getting to me. Right before I got laid off from my last job, I bought a car for the first time in my life. And I was stuck with so many bills that I could barely keep up. My credit card debt has skyrocketed, my savings account diminished, and whatever money I had to help me get through it was from unemployment benefits. Being surrounded by my incredibly successful girlfriend and her family made things even more gutt-wrenching for me. I know her parents somewhat wish I were more successful and I could really feel it every time I was around them.

But now, I finally got a job again! And it's in a company that's growing everyday. It's a full time office job that's literally a few feet away from my college, so taking night classes has never been easier!

I'm so damn excited and I'm keeping it all in right now. But I just wanted to share this with you guys.

If you're unemployed right now, applying to jobs and getting no responses, building debt and stressing out every day, **DON'T GIVE UP!** Keep applying every single day, to as many jobs as you possible can. Make applying to jobs your **job**. I'm positive you'll find something. And when you do, you'll feel great about yourself!
