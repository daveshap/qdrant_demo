SARA: This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
GRADY: Would Walter really press charges?
SARA: It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
SARA: You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
GRADY: I think I might have.
SARA: And what do you think you might have said?
GRADY: I think I might've said I was in love with you.
GRADY: He told you.
SARA: He told me.
GRADY: And what did you say?
SARA: I said it didn't sound like you.
CRABTREE: So -- what do we do now?
GRADY: Find the jacket.
CRABTREE: Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
GRADY: First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
CRABTREE: It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
