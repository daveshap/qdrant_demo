COLWYN: The White Castle has fallen.
YNYR: Does the Queen live?
COLWYN: The new Queen lives.
YNYR: Turold's son was to marry her.
COLWYN: We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
YNYR: I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
