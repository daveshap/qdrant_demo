Jobs Abroad
Recently I have been thinking about my next steps and I wanted to know if anyone has any experience or knowledge in applying for jobs abroad. 

I graduated with my degree in Higher Ed a few years ago and I've been working in financial aid for slightly over at a large university. When I was applying for jobs, I recall someone talking about getting experience working abroad, particularly in Australia. This individual said there were a decent amount of opportunities there and it was a good way to build experience.

I'm in a position right now where I think I would like to continue working in the field, but I'd love the opportunity to go abroad. Does anyone know a good place to find these jobs or any resources I could use?

Thanks so much!
