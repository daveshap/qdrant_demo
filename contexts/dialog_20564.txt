MARION: Don't go in there.
GABRIEL: Is it her? Is Anne in there?
MARION: She is. Don't go in there.
GABRIEL: Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
MARION: You know what happened.
GABRIEL: No, I don't.
MARION: Everyone knows. It's what made me a hero. Me, Harry Lee, all of us. I got a medal. Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes. Everyone knows what happened.
GABRIEL: Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
MARION: And what do they know?
GABRIEL: That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
MARION: That's right.
GABRIEL: That's not enough. Tell me.
MARION: Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born. I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
MARION: That's why it was four years between you and Thomas. It took me that long to regain her respect.
GABRIEL: I'm not my mother. I can't have the respect without the knowing.
