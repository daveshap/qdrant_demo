MARY: Oh my God... Ted. What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
TED: Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
MARY: And did everything -- ?
TED: Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
TED: How are you doing, Warren?
WARREN: Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
TED: I'm gonna take a rain check.
MARY: I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody. You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
TED: Really? I never got a message.
MARY: That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
MARY: By the way, how's he doing?
TED: He's dead.
MARY: Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
TED: No, it was a good thing. I mean, good in that it was very quick.
MARY: Oh. So... what brings you down here?
TED: Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
MARY: Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
TED: Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets. God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
MARY: Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
TED: Oh... are you... ?
MARY: Nope, haven't walked the plank yet. There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
TED: Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
