It really sucks to have realized that life is meaningless at such a young age
I realized it when I was 16, I’m 18 now. There really is no point, you grow up, you get a job, you try to make money but always end up not having enough of it, then you die. It’s really sad because I wish there was a purpose but in reality there really isn’t. The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because of how sad I know my mom and dad would be. I couldn’t do that to them. They are so loving and they work so hard in this meaningless life just to do the same thing every other mid level family does. I probably won’t ever kill myself, im too much of a pussy, but god does it suck always wanting to be dead.

Thanks for all the support from everyone:) it has made me a bit happy to know that a lot of people understand. If you’d like, my whole situation is on my other post on my profile. Give it a read if you really want to understand what I’m going thru
