Spent my whole paycheck.
Paid rent for this month, power and utilities. Plus I finally paid off a payday loan from two months ago, and I was able to bring my bank account to it’s minimum member amount. After a long time of doing things the hard way this sub has really helped me get a grasp on these basic skills. 

Thanks, see you next paycheck!

Edit: I just want to say thank you guys for all the support, I mostly lurk but I’ve been on redddit for years. Honestly means a lot to have this support, I was kinda bumming about being broke but you’ve helped me see the bigger picture again! Keep on keeping on
