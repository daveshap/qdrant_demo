LILY: Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
GASTON: No--no.
LILY: Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
GASTON: I would like to.
LILY: You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
GASTON: Why should you?
LILY: But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
GASTON: Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
LILY: You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
GASTON: Thank you!
LILY: Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
GASTON: Disappointed?
LILY: No--proud. Very proud!
