No Such Thing As Downtime
I am a receptionist for a small business, that has a lot of family ties (upper management, week day receptionist, etc). I'm one of two receptionists that work on either Saturday or Sunday, and I'm a full time student as well. My boss chewed the weekenders out via text recently, saying that we should never be on our phone, or drawing, or doing work (not even homework) outside of the company, or even being on the internet outside of for the job. This would seem reasonable, except that we don't have a ton of things to do. We have data entry we can do (until we do it all), emails and phone to answer (until we don't have any), general cleaning (until everything has been dusted and swept and it's tidy). I understand wanting us to appear busy at all times, but if we aren't even allowed to read articles online, then what is there to do besides sit blankly?  It REALLY gets me that I can look at the computer's history and see the main receptionist (my bosses' family member) searching about healing stones and illness symptoms, but that's not something I can change.

Am I in the wrong? Any suggestions, on how to deal or what to do with this downtime?
