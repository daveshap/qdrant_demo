DESMOND: What is it?
STANLEY: It is a piece of paper with the letter T" imprinted on it. Take a look."
STANLEY: Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
DESMOND: We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
STANLEY: Yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. I didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, Agent Desmond?
