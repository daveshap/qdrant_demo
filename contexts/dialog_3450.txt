WILL: Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.
EDWARD: You mean, while I'm here.
WILL: I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
EDWARD: Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
WILL: I will.
EDWARD: You know where the chemicals are?
WILL: I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
