Dropping 50VAC to 10VAC-20VAC I am installing a Ring door bell.  At the old intercom I have 50VAC currently (NO other source).  According to the manufacturer I need between 8VAC and 24VAC.  My question is what resistance (resisters) would I need to reduce the voltage?The input is 50vac, I can NOT get a source of 120vac. Could I go with a regulator that has a steady 12vac output instead?  Just not sure it can take the 50VAC input. I am located in California. Thanks!!!
