DAVID: Finished.
ALEX: But not quite.
DAVID: Is that going to be deep enough?
ALEX: Don't you worry about that.
DAVID: Is this necessary?
ALEX: Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
JULIET: Are you all right?
DAVID: Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
JULIET: Would you like to talk about it?
DAVID: No.
JULIET: Be careful.
ALEX: Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
JULIET: Stop nagging.
ALEX: I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
