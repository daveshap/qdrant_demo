What are the differences between Convex Lens and Convex Mirrors? Sometimes I heard my teacher said convex 'lens' but other time I heard he said convex 'mirror'. The main problem I am currently facing right now is using the right terminology. In other words, what is the differences and similarities between a convex 'lens' and 'mirrors'? With that said, do they still behave the same like one another, if they are different? Thank you.
