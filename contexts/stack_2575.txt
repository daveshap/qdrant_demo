Select features in a polygon that covered the most by features of another polygon layer QGIS I am working in QGIS. I have 2 polygon layers,One layer is the parcel polygons layer for a county called \"Parcel\"The other layer is the building footprints polygon layer for the same county called \"BuildingFootprint\"The building footprints features overlap multiple parcel polygons. I want to select the parcel polygons that the building footprint overlaps the most (majority). So for example, if I have two parcel polygon features overlapped by one building footprint feature, I want to select the parcel polygon that is covered by 90% of the building footprint feature and not select the parcel polygon feature that is covered by 10% of the building footprint. Uncovering a way to select the parcel that is covered by majority of the building footprint will then allow me to join that particular parcel feature's number to the building footrpint feature's attribute table.
