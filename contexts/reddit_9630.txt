/r/talesfromtheRA- come share stories about horrible duty nights and disappointing programs!
Are you or were you an RA/CA during your undergraduate? If you have wild stories about the nightmare that was homecoming weekend duty, or if you just want to vent about an annoying interaction with your residents or a DSJ program that only other RAs showed up to, I invite you to /r/talesfromtheRA. It's a new subreddit that we'd like to get going. We welcome all sorts of tales, positive or negative.

I hope to see you there!
