I don't want to commit suicide, but it's almost all I think about.
Okay, "want" is the wrong word. "Can't" fits better.

I *can't* kill myself because of what it would do to my family, how it would tear everything apart. I can't do that to them. 

I need help. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I want to get better, I want to go back to how it used to be. I  just can't do this anymore.

Please please someone help me. I can't keep feeling like this.
