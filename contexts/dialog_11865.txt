LAURIE: Fancy.
ANNIE: This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
LAURIE: I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
ANNIE: I can't.
LAURIE: Yes, you can.
ANNIE: He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
LAURIE: Wait a minute here...
ANNIE: If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
LAURIE: Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
ANNIE: He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
