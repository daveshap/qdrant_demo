Is there hope for a 29 year old with no career?
So basically, I'm a 29 year old Guy who doesn't really have a career. What bothers me is, I really don't feel pulled in any particular direction. I have passion for life, but just don't identify with a notion headed towards a specific career, which is troubling. I have pretty decent school results (UK), but no university degree.

I've had jobs before, like stores as a teenager, and worked for a while in the airport (a job my Dad got me), but I always had trouble with my family, wound up feeling disconnected from life and myself and developed drug addictions in my late teens, which got worse in my early 20s, which spiraled and wound up with me on Government assistance and schizoaffective disorder. But now I'm 29 and I've managed to quit drugs and restore my sanity and would like to contribute to society (and my own well being, since work is good for that).

I just need to *pick something*.. It's very frustrating to have the will but not know which way to go (not even slightly. I rack my brains and there's nothing). I hope somebody here can help guide me in the right direction.
