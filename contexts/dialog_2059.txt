KETCHAM: Hey, do you mind if I talk a little? I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
RATH: Sure.
KETCHAM: Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that. 'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.' I never would though. Not really.
RATH: Why not?
KETCHAM: I don't know. Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?' I don't know. Maybe I didn't trust her.
