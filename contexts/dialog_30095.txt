NED: Some fucker's shootin' at us.
MUNNY: Yeah.
NED: He hit you?
MUNNY: Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
NED: He ain't shootin' our way no more. He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
MUNNY: Beats the hell out of me.
NED: You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
MUNNY: I didn't see nothin' planted.
