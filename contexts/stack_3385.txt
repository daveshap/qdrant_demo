70s/80s Sci-Fi book with teleport gates on sub-light spacecraft and an army space suit I must have read this 35 years ago.The book was a not particularly thick paperback, which as I recall had a picture of a spacesuit helmet on the cover - white helmet with a green visor which looked a bit like oversize Aviator sunglasses.The story was about a man whose job was to go through teleport gates onto spacecraft. The spacecraft were unmanned exploration craft and had been operating for many decades. The teleport gates provided the way of maintaining them.  Once the ships reached a world, the gates formed the beach-head for colonisation and exploration, with more people and bigger gates and other equipment being teleported through. The navy dealt with stuff in orbit, and the army with stuff planet-side.The ships were slower than light, unmanned, automated exploration vessels launched in large numbers.  Teleportation could only be achieved between two gates, so the far gates were carried on the space craft.As I recall the main character is ex-army, which becomes important because his suit is army rather than navy and more heavily armoured. Normally in his job he would be navy/have a navy suit. When aliens are encountered this saves him.  There is some kind of orbital battle when a ship reaches a new world and is either jumped by aliens nor they are already there.I also recall a teleport gate being on a crashed ship on Venus, and this is a key part of the main plot line which involves some sort of conspiracy (getting hazy now). I think there is a girl involved on Venus too.I vaguely remember that some of the maintenance men had not been coming back from their trips out to the space craft and that may have been why the main character was brought in.I fancied at one time that it was a book by Brian Aldiss, but I have searched and can't find anything by him which fits the bill.
