The USSR and their various Committees and Ministries are often depicted as having been dysfunctional because of the poor incentive structures from communist philosophy. To specific Committees and Ministries, why were some run poorly, and were any run well? (services/products that rivaled the US)
The USSR was functionally run by various [Committees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Committee_of_the_Soviet_Union) (KGB, TV/Radio, Planning) and [Ministries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministries_of_the_Soviet_Union) (Justice, Military) that operated under specific duties.

It's often depicted in [TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries\)) and [movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_X) that much of the Soviet Union was run poorly at various institutional levels.

This is also backed up with many real [long term trends during the soviet era](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1990/06/inside-the-collapsing-soviet-economy/303870/), and [specific events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster) that stemmed from institutional dysfunction at multiple administrative levels (Planning of the structure, personnel).

To specific Committees and Ministries, and concerning individual events or stretches of time during the USSR, I have a couple of questions about how they functioned:

1: For Ministries and Committees that performed **poorly** in the long term or short term, how specifically did they operate **dysfunctionally**, and what was the outcome? 

2: For Ministries and Committees that performed **well** in the long term or short term, how specifically did they operate **efficiently**, and what was the outcome?
