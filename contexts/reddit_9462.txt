Introducing r/MiddleClassFinance
Hello all!

I have created a new subreddit called r/middleclassfinance.  Its meant to help people who identify as being middle class find a place to discuss financial issues that don't currently feel like they have a place to discuss them.  

a few days ago I was preparing to make a post on here and honestly thought about it and with the stated purpose behind poverty finance it just didn't make sense.  It was (in my opinion) good information that might help people save money but with the purpose of the sub didn't feel like the right place.  

Similarly Personal finance might have based on name been the right place, but in reality and based on having been subbed there for over two years really didn't feel right either. So I took a look around and didn't feel like there was a place to discuss being in the middle class and dealing with issues like I was thinking about posting about or asking questions.  

r/MiddleClassFinance is meant to be a place where people can come and have a discussion about middle class financial issues, questions, tips or advice.  

All are welcome, so come on down and join us if you'd like!  

Thanks,
