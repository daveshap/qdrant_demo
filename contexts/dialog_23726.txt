ST. LUC: He didn't make it.
ROLLO: Huh?
ST. LUC: Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
ROLLO: I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
ST. LUC: I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
ROLLO: Yeah. Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
ST. LUC: Yeah? What do I do then?
ROLLO: I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
ST. LUC: OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
ROLLO: OK, Rog. See you at ten.
FORSYTHE: Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
ST. LUC: Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
FORSYTHE: Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
FORSYTHE: Anything wrong?
ST. LUC: No. I don't think so.
FORSYTHE: Well? Supper at my place?
ST. LUC: OK. But late.
FORSYTHE: Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
