JUSTINE: Poor William! What indignant tears!
ELIZABETH: There, there... shhh...
ELIZABETH: Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
VICTOR: The world is a dizzying place.
ELIZABETH: Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
VICTOR: He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
ELIZABETH: That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
JUSTINE: Quite right!
VICTOR: Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
ELIZABETH: Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
