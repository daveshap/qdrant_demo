SECRETARY: There's only one thing that will stop the Martians! We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians. Now there's no choice. The United Nations has voted authority to the United States. The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
CHIEF OF STAFF: Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
SECRETARY: I'll request the scientists from Pacific-Tech to monitor the drop. We'll clear the area all around. After that we'll hit them all over the world. I'll have long-range bombers alerted, loaded and standing by.
