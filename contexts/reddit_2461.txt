Has anyone here changed jobs because of 1 coworker?
I work at a small family run office that totals maybe around 25 people total. I am in a more supportive role, so collaborations with other heads of departments is critical to my job.

Enter $NastyCoworker. $NastyCoworker is tasked with running the day to day operations of an important part of the company. $NastyCoworker's direct boss is also my direct boss.

There have been several incidents with her that I won't lengthen the post with, but what may have been the final straw for me was a meeting I had recently. I am working on a project for my Direct boss and $NastyCoworker, to make their workflow in our system smoother. I followed the requirements, with only a few minor things that can get changed down the line as we continue to improve the system. My mistake: I didn't get the changes my boss and $NastyCoworker requested in writing.

Well $NastyCoworker didn't like the changes at all. Started up on a soap box about how she is never listened to and how I wasted all this time on changes that she didn't want. Basically saying openly in a meeting that I am incompetent. My boss basically tiptoed around her the entire meeting and once we got done with the meeting I called him directly and he agreed that she was off her rocker and I had made changes she wanted. He seems to think she has some bias against me because I am so much younger than her and in her eyes I am a kid. (I'm 3 years out of college). He then said he would speak with her about how "This behavior cannot continue", but I have already heard through the grapevine that it was the same old slap on the wrist with nothing actually being done.


I often think about leaving if a new job comes up but other than this one person this job isn't that bad, it's just that I am forced into collaborating with someone so awful.
