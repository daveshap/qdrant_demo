MACK: You boys been hitting the pipe?
WEAZE: No, Eddie. It's just that, I dunno. He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur. All I remember is the voice. It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
MACK: Then how'd you hear it, fool?
WEAZE: It was just like in my head.
MACK: Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise.
