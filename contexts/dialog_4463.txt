ANTHONY: The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. Things Dignan was not supposed to touch.""
DIGNAN: Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
ANTHONY: That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
DIGNAN: Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
ANTHONY: Then you shouldn't of gone in there, Dignan. Maybe we should of robbed your house. Did you ever think of that?
