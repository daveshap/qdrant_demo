CORKY: Truck.
VIOLET: Truck. Of course.
CORKY: '63 Chevy.
VIOLET: I knew it.
VIOLET: So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
CORKY: I don't, really. I was referred to him.
VIOLET: Oh, really.
CORKY: Do you know him?
VIOLET: No, but Caesar does. He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
CORKY: Caesar is your husband?
VIOLET: Oh no, no. I'm not the marrying kind.
VIOLET: I should be going. You can drop the cup off anytime.
CORKY: Thanks.
VIOLET: My pleasure.
