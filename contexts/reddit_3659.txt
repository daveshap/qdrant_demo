10 Lessons Learnt from dating over an year.
Female's Perspective : I read this list everytime I start talking to a guy.

1. Everything is temporary, the attention, they complimenting you, those words or acts of validation, they making you feel special.
Atleast in the initial days/months.

2. Don't try to built a rapport right away, it kills your rationale. Slow and steady always wins.

3. In reference to online dating - Be the same as you appear to be on chats or maybe a level up. Appearing bold and fun over screen is much easier than in person.

4. Stop being nice. Show your considerate, loving, accomodating self after someone is hooked to you emotionally. 

5. Sleep with a guy on the first day, only if you are okay with him not calling/texting you the next day. Men say a lot before taking you to bed and forget everything the next day. 

6. I don't care about you attitude goes long way. Be selfish, think only about you. Don't be mean or rude, but altering your ways or believes for someone doesn't work. Men will only value you as much as you value yourself. 

7. Know the red flags men show you and act on them when you see. Moving away from wrong people as fast as you can is the key to dating. 

8. Be a good kisser/in bed - educate yourself, tips tricks take you long.

9. Men often drive the conversations in and around sex, if thats not what you looking for just ask good questions in return. You should drive the nature of conversations you want to have. If he stops responding, he was never in it for you.

10. Date with an intention, if the guy says casual he means it, you can't turn it around. And if he doesn't say it, he definately means casual.


EDIT : 

#6, my words are harsh, I only meant, I will do me whether you like me or not. 

#4 : Stop being extra nice, apart from being a decent human being, your nice ness would be taken for granted.
