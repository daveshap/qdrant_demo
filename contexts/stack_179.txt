I would like to fax from my Mac running High Sierra I need to fax a couple of pages from my Mac. My printer doesn't seem to support faxing. I found one online site that will fax from a mac but they wanted a monthly subscription starting at $12.95 a month. Is there another way to fax without going somewhere that will fax for me?
