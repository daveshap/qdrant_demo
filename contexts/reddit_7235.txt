Just got hired at Walgreens! Any advice for a newbie?
I had my interview at Walgreens today and got hired immediately. I'm a little nervous... this is my going to be first job straight outta high school, and I've heard tons of bad things about retail like ahem rude customers. Not sure if I'm ready to deal with those type of people lol. I'm not as quick as other people, so I prefer to take things step by step. Also I have a bit..no A LOT of social anxiety and last thing that I want to happen is to get screwed over at my first ever job.

Anyone with experience in retail, but specifically Walgreens, can you pitch in and tell me about your experience working there? I know that it's different at every store but I just want to get a general idea of what it's like so I know what type of environment I'll be working in for the next weeks to come. What did you find particularly challenging about your job? Any rude customer stories and how you dealt with them? Advice you would give to someone like me who struggles with said issues?

Thanks!
