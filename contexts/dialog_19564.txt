JACK: <i> Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
VARIOUS PEOPLE: <i> -- A bow? -- But why? -- How ugly! -- What's in it? -- What's in it?</i>
JACK: <i> That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
VARIOUS PEOPLE: <i> -- It's a bat. -- Will it bend? -- It's a rat. -- Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
JACK: <i> Listen now, you don't understand. That's not the point of Christmasland.</i>
