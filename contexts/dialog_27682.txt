MELANIE: No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
LYDIA: Oh, thank you.
LYDIA: Where's Mitch?
MELANIE: Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
LYDIA: Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
MELANIE: He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
LYDIA: Then he saw.
MELANIE: He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
LYDIA: What good will they do?
LYDIA: Do you think Cathy's all right?
MELANIE: What?
LYDIA: Cathy. At the school.
MELANIE: Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
LYDIA: Do I sound foolish to you?
MELANIE: No.
LYDIA: I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face. They have such big windows at the school. All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
MELANIE: Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
LYDIA: I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
LYDIA: I lost my husband four years ago, you know. It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone. I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep. Do you think Cathy's all right?
MELANIE: Annie's there. She'll be all right.
LYDIA: I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children. When Frank died... You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
MELANIE: Yes.
LYDIA: I wish I could be that way.
LYDIA: I miss him. You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember. I miss talking to him. Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch... ...Mitch has his own life. I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here.
MELANIE: Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
LYDIA: No. No... don't go yet. I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
MELANIE: Why, Mrs. Brenner?
LYDIA: Because my son is... My son seems to be fond of you. And I... I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
MELANIE: Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
LYDIA: Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
MELANIE: And if you don't?
LYDIA: Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
MELANIE: I think it might also matter to Mitch.
LYDIA: Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do. I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man. But... You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone. I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset. I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
MELANIE: Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
LYDIA: I wish I were stronger. Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
MELANIE: Would you like me to go for her?
LYDIA: I couldn't ask you to.
MELANIE: I don't mind, really.
LYDIA: Would you? I'd feel so much better.
MELANIE: I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
