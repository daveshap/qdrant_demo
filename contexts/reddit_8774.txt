I recently heard in a radio piece, that the agricultural sector in Russia thrives due to the sanctions imposed by Europe and the USA. How does Russia's economy do and is the growth confined to agriculture or is the entire economy growing?
Here are some sources. The financial Times has an article about it aswell, but I am not subscribed to them so I can't read it.
