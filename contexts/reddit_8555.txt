What would the pros and cons of the US adopting gun laws similar to Australia's be?
I'm sure we have all been seeing plenty of takes after the Vegas shooting. Australia keeps coming up for their [gun control laws which came about after a mass shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Australia) and many saying that they [were and are effective](

I have also seen some say [we can't quite get an accurate comparison on various gun laws based on how some countries count homicides](https://crimeresearch.org/2014/03/comparing-murder-rates-across-countries/) or that Australia in particular [already was seeing a downward trend in gun violence](http://www.businessinsider.com/australia-gun-control-shootings-2015-10)
