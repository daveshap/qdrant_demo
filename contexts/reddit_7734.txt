Advice for an interview about working with my PI?
My PI has recently received a prestigious award in her field. As a result, I have received an unexpected request: an undergrad who works for the school newspaper wants to interview me about what it's like to work with my PI. I accepted, because I didn't want to be rude, but I have social anxiety and have no idea what I'm going to say. I wish the undergrad could send me questions in advance so I can prepare. Have any of you been in this situation? I'm pretty anxious about this; anything I will say has a chance of being quoted and read by anyone in the school, so I want to give a good impression of both my PI and myself.
