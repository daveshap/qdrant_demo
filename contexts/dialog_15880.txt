GUMP: So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
JACK: Gump, is it?
GUMP: Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
JACK: I'm in no mood for dancing.
GUMP: Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
JACK: Faerie ring?
GUMP: To be sure.
