MAUDE: Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
DUDE: Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
DUDE: I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
MAUDE: Uh-huh.
DUDE: Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
MAUDE: Mmnun.
DUDE: And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
MAUDE: Oh?
DUDE: Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour.
MAUDE: Uh-huh.
DUDE: Bunch of assholes. And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
MAUDE: What do you do for fun?
DUDE: Oh, you know, the usual. Bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback.
MAUDE: What happened to your house?
DUDE: Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
MAUDE: Finder's fee?
DUDE: He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
MAUDE: It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's. Why did he think you had it? And who does?
DUDE: Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
MAUDE: Jeffrey--
DUDE: It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs. Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber. I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close. It's just--
MAUDE: I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money. Father doesn't have any.
DUDE: Huh? He's fucking loaded.
MAUDE: No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
DUDE: But your father--he runs stuff, he--
MAUDE: We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
DUDE: But he's--
MAUDE: He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance. He has no money of his own. I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
DUDE: Huh. Jeez. Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
