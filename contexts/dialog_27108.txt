DORIS: ...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
ED: Honey...
DORIS: I knew we'd pay for it.
FRANK: This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
ED: Yeah.
FRANK: Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
ED: Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
FRANK: I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
ED: That's very generous.
FRANK: The hell with it, Eddie!
FRANK: They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
ED: Uh-huh.
FRANK: Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
ED: Uh-huh.
FRANK: They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
