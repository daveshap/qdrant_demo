JENNIFER: How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
FRIDA: You're just saying that.
JENNIFER: Do you really need these?

JENNIFER: Can't you get contacts?
FRIDA: No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
JENNIFER: Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
