RACHEL: Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
JACKIE: I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
RACHEL: I was in there in him.
JACKIE: Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
RACHEL: No. I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
JACKIE: You mean for you. A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family. She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen? This isn't going to work out.
RACHEL: You're damn right. I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit. I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker. If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead! I have a life!
JACKIE: Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
RACHEL: Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>. Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
JACKIE: Get out!
RACHEL: But it's not on the schedule!
JACKIE: You got to hell!
