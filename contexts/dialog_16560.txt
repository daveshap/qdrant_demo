LOVETT: Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
BARNARD: Will you stop squawking!
LOVETT: Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
BARNARD: You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
BARNARD: Something tells me this means food. Come on!
LOVETT: I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
BARNARD: Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
LOVETT: That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
BARNARD: Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
LOVETT: Please don't call me Lovey.
