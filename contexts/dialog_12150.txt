PENELOPE: He doesn't deserve this! You don't know him. It isn't fair!
HAROLD: He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
WOODLY: I thought she was a widow.
HAROLD: You were wrong, you quack!
PENELOPE: Awful. I can't tell you how sorry I am.
HAROLD: Say hello to your mother.
PENELOPE: Do say hello to your mother.
WOODLY: I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now. She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
PENELOPE: Tell her to have a nice trip.
WOODLY: Thanks.
WOODLY: I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
HAROLD: What for?
WOODLY: Quarantine, possibly. You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without. Goodbye.
HAROLD: Now that's what I call fun.
PENELOPE: Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
HAROLD: You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again. You used to eat it up.
PENELOPE: I did?
HAROLD: We were one hell of a pair--and we'll be one again. What we need is a honeymoon. Let's start right now.
PENELOPE: A trip, you mean?
HAROLD: I had a trip. We'll honeymoon here. Go out and play.
PAUL: Play?
HAROLD: Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
PENELOPE: He hasn't had breakfast yet.
HAROLD: Buy yourself breakfast. There we go.
PAUL: A hundred dollars!
HAROLD: The smallest thing I've got.
PAUL: Can I get dressed first?
HAROLD: Make it fast.
HAROLD: Honeymoon! Honeymoon! Say it: Honeymoon!
PENELOPE: It's so--so stark.
HAROLD: You used to like it stark!
PENELOPE: Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
HAROLD: I'm not going to strike you. I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie. You mustn't run away now. This is your loving husband approaching. I'm your husband. Society approves!
