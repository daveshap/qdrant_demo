I was having trouble with a supplement and my mom turned it into a competition to motivate me. God, I love her.
I was experiencing some serious writer's block with this 650 word supplement for one of my EA schools. I had written like five versions but hated all of them. I began to panic, since the deadline is a day away and I still had nothing to write about. 

So my mom came into my room and gave me a big hug and sat there with me for two hours as I bounced ideas off of her. We decided on one that we both liked and instead of leaving me alone to write it, my mom said that she would write her version/interpretation of the essay in Chinese. After two hours, we would then check back in with each other and read our essays. 

My mom is a fantastic writer with a background in literature and journalism. I am so thankful for her. Her little competition spurred me to crank out an essay that I was fairly proud of. It made her cry. Her essay was wonderful (as expected) when she read it to me. She provided me with some incredibly thoughtful feedback that I all took into account. I'm really happy with my essay now. 

Love her.
