I feel like I’ve been an observer in my own life for years now
Just finished a degree at university. Now it’s on to the big wife world and finding a job, finding a significant other, figuring out where I want to live and what I want to do with the rest of my life.

And I can’t help but feel like past me was careless and hopelessly optimistic about everything.

I just moved along through the last couple of years, I made acquaintances, but once I moved apartments everyone just kinda drifted away and I haven’t done anything to stop that.

Now I feel like I’ve been placed at the start of an open world game having just completed the tutorial, but I’m completely aimless. I went to school, I went to college, I pursued a degree in computer science, and now it’s as if everything before me is inaccessible because I haven’t had years of experience or contacts.

I’m not suicidal or anything, never really considered it an option, but it seems like everyone is supposed to have a goal, something they want. The only thing I want is not to be a burden. But I can’t seem to find a way to be fully independent.

I could go on and on, but I’ve rambled enough, and I think in the midst of that train wreck of thought is the gist of what I’m trying to say.
