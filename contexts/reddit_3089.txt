Best ways to improve public speaking/reduce social anxiety before beginning a job?
I'm a very type B person. I think my interpersonal skills when one on one or in a small group are ok, but I am deathly terrified of public speaking, or even speaking up in a medium sized meeting. Anytime I have to give a presentation, introduce myself publicly in front of a large group of people, or something similar, my heart begins to race and I have a panic attack where I'm short of breath and my voice is shaky. It's embarrassing because I don't have any mental anxiety about these situations, but its entirely physical and I have no control over it. It's like muscle memory.

I have had a prescription for beta blockers which have been an absolute miracle and basically gotten rid of any anxiety symptoms when in these situations. I will still use them during major presentations, but I don't want to feel reliant on them, and would prefer to go through some sort or training that can rewire my brain into not becoming stressed in these situations. I'm about to graduate college and begin a great job in a major city in which I will often have to give presentations to clients, and I will be surrounded by a lot of type A corporate individuals.

At this point it's absolutely essential that I get over this and am able to assimilate into my new job seamlessly. Would joining a Toastmasters club or Dale Carnegie help? I figure that practice is what will help me get over it, by teaching my brain to become less stressed in these situations. Unfortunately, I am unable to take a public speaking course at my university. I checked a local community college, but was confused if I was able to enroll not being a student, and if what I found was even a legitimate course. I believe this form of social anxiety I have is probably my biggest weakness and a major barrier that once its overcome, will allow me to thrive professionally.

Any advice, tips, or similar experiences that can be shared would be appreciated. I begin my new job this summer, and I feel like the longer I go without fixing this, the harder it will be to do so.
