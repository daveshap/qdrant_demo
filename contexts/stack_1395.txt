Ampere in Parallel Circuit not increasing linearly I have a PV panel circuit, connected in parallel configuration. Each panel (enclosed in dotted square) is of ~30V. The problem is, total amperes on the output do not increase linearly; even though load is a big air conditioner.This is what I get on output when I connect panels one by one: 7Amp, 12Amp, 16Amp, 19Amp, 21Amp, 22Amp.Is there a problem with my circuit configuration? I have drawn exact diagram as the wires in the circuit.
