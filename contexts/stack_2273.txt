Steam wants to redownload half-downloaded game I was downloading Rainbow Six Siege and I added the texture pack before it finished.I regretted it and unchecked the tick in the DLC tab, but now Steam is trying to re-download the whole game. I have about 30 GB of the game data in the downloads folder of Steam, but it won't recognize it.Is there anything I can do to fix this? I don't have unlimited net traffic.And i also don't have the .acf file in the downloads folder,it's been replaced, i only have the game files.
