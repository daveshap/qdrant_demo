Walking away is beneficial
If someone loses interest in you then the best thing to do is to not chase after them and instead walk away.

Whenever I feel like the spark has died, I walk away. I delete them off social media, why? 

Deleting them helps in several ways:

-It shows you aren’t needy and are willing to move on.

-It helps with your mental health. You won’t be posting on social media in the hope that they see/ in an attempt to impress them. 

-You won’t see what they’re up to, which can make you jealous if it seems like they are living a better life than you. 

-You won’t feel the need to stalk their profiles and think about them.

-You can clear that mental space that the person has been taking up and focus on self-improvement.

I’ve unfollowed several girls I’ve had a thing with in the past and they done one of two things:

-Chased after me, shows they’re interested.

-Never messaged me again, shows that they aren’t interested.

Either way I’ve won.
