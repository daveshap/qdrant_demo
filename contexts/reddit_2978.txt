How do I know is time to move on from a job?
I want to find a better job, but also feel guilty every time I consider leaving my current job. At the moment I work for a startup I helped fund, we are still on seed stage, as usual on startups the money is tight and we are facing issues with app development which is threatening my work stability, our crew is very reduced and I'm vital to this project, my team depends a lot on me. 

On the other hand, the payment isn't the greatest and one of our crew members is giving me a hard time lately, I feel underappreciated. 
Right now I'm bouncing between staying in the startup or finding a better job where I feel appreciated. Help.

Edit: wow, thank you guys for being such a supportive community, I'm very impressed. I took a day off and evaluated my situation and I decided to move on, I updated my resume and started looking for new opportunities. Thank you so much for your comments and support. Hopefully I'll be on a best position very soon.
