New file/database in OmniFocus 2 for macOS When first starting to use OmniFocus, it opens with some example data preloaded for practice. Am I supposed to delete that bogus data, and continue to use that existing file/database for my own data? Or am I supposed to create a new distinct file or database for my own real data? I\u2019ve tried looking through the manual. But I do not see anything about new files or about backing up my database.
