Where do you store your luggage in Dutch intercity trains? I'll be travelling from Amsterdam airport to Rotterdam and I was wondering where do you actually store your luggage in these trains? The only experience I have with trains in Europe was with TGV's but since they cover a large distance, there were luggage racks present in the train. I've never really took local trains in Europe before and certainly not in the Netherlands so although it may sound like a very basic questions, I would still like to know if anybody here has traveled in these Dutch intercity trains before and can advice me where I can put my large 30kg suitcase that I'll be travelling with? Are there any sort of luggage racks in the back of the coach like in TGV's? Would it be a better idea to purchase tickets in the first class to avoid rush and get space to store my stuff?
