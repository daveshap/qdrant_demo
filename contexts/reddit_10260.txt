Failed suicide attempt
Yesterday I clean my house, packed my bag with robe and went into the woods. I arrived there at 10pm and smoked a few sigartes and listened to the animal noises. I prepared my rope and let myself drop. The first minute was peacefull but then I started having a panic attack and started seeing all blurry and my hearing went away. If I didn't have my pocket knife to cut the rope I was gone. But I was to much of a coward and cut it. Some people know like my father but they don't care. I really need a hug. I haven't heard or seen someone familiar in the past 2months. I really grave love, understanding, kidness, a hand, a shoulder. I am so lonely. I don't understand that people don't care what happened yesterday I don't. Am I this bad of a person? U don't think so I'm just mentally unstable. Anyone from Belgium whom wants to be my friend? I don't  want to be pathetic but I'm so lonely I miss love so much. I'm going to stop now I don't want to cry ;) thanks in advance for the people reading this.
