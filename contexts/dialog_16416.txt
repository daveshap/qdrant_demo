BUTTERFIELD: D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
MILLER: I know him. I saw him.
MILLER: I saw him on T.V. Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
BUTTERFIELD: He's a priest?
MILLER: No. He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit. Like you.
BUTTERFIELD: I don't want him getting in the way.
MILLER: He won't.
BUTTERFIELD: We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
MILLER: What do you mean, all of us?""
BUTTERFIELD: You didn't think it was just going to be you and me? A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
MILLER: About?
BUTTERFIELD: Death.
MILLER: What about death?
BUTTERFIELD: It's an illusion.
