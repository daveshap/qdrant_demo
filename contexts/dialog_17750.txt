COWAN: And Goodwill Toward Man?
KAY: No. just peace on Earth.
COWAN: I gotta be honest about something.
ZED: You think we're nuts.
COWAN: No-- it makes sense. Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
ZED: Mrs. Edelson?
KAY: Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
ZED: So whattya say, kid? You in or out?
COWAN: Once I thought the biggest thing I'll ever do was guard the president.
KAY: Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
ZED: Only the damn guy won't know it.
COWAN: What happens if I say no?
KAY: It's easy. You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
COWAN: And if I say yes?
KAY: Lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who don't know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
