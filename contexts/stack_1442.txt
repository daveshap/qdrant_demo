Need a switch/circuit breaker that stops power supply to equipment when power comes back after outage I need a switch that stops power supply(220VAC) to led tv when power comes back after outage. So i need a circuit breaker that breaks the circuit when power supply is off and needs manual switch on from this circuit breaker device when power supply is on. I have two ideas:I feel its possible using microcontroller and relay but i think it would be costly and time consuming to make such device. I am also having idea about using magnetic coil as in magnetic circuit breakers but not confident about its effectiveness. As i am unable to find such device on commercial websites, so i need help in finding such device if commercially available and/or making such switch/circuit breaker in a simplest and cheapest possible way.
