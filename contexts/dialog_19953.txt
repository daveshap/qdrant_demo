WESLEY: Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
SUE ANN: I wish I could help you, but I can't.
WESLEY: Aren't they precious? Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
SUE ANN: No. Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
WESLEY: I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
SUE ANN: No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
WESLEY: Her show?
SUE ANN: A Reason to Love.""
WESLEY: I see. Did Chloe testify?
SUE ANN: I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
WESLEY: Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
CHARLIE: ...and how long did she work here?
DARLENE: Oh, five years, give or take.
CHARLIE: Hmm... you two in high school together?
DARLENE: Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
CHARLIE: But she wanted more out of life, right?
DARLENE: No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
CHARLIE: I see. May I?
DARLENE: If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
CHARLIE: Thank you for your cooperation. Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
DARLENE: ...who doesn't?
