so sick of restarting. rant with me!
idk how many more games of 21 questions i can take, ya'll im so tired of telling guys my favourite colour and my favourite movie. i played them with people i just wanted flings with, but now i really am looking for a relationship. i hope the guy i'm talking to now will be the last one i play 21 questions with for a while! 

It's all 'cause one day I looked at my sister n her boyfriend and realised, i wanna take the same guy to every family party,  bring the same guy home and wake up with one name on my phone everyday. sadly, haven't found a guy i'm really compatible with. 

why is it so tough out here. sigh.
