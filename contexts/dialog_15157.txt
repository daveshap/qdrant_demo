GABRIELA: I was having an affair with Eduard. He didn't tell you?
KAFKA: No.
GABRIELA: He would have. You were his best friend. A better friend than me.
KAFKA: I suspected that he -- well.
GABRIELA: What?
KAFKA: That he was -- satisfied in that regard. I didn't want to pry.
GABRIELA: It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
GABRIELA: What's funny?
KAFKA: This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
GABRIELA: As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
KAFKA: How long were you and Eduard --
GABRIELA: Two or three months, that's all. -- I seduced him.
