Why isn’t online speed dating more popular?
I feel like online speed dating should have become more popular, especially during these times. However, I don’t see any apps or sites which do this at the scale of other dating apps. There are several advantages with a video speed date-
1. You can’t catfish 
2. With a 2-3 min interaction, you can atleast filter out people you can’t stand
3. You spend way less time overall - no swiping, messaging folks part interested. You could still have that while following up with someone after a speed date, but such cases should be less.

I’m surprised Tinder/Bumble haven’t jumped on this already - they could rebrand it if speed dating is seen as something from the past. I know the league does it, but their CX is crap tbh. And the local speed dating events are just not good enough - they don’t have enough signups.
