MRS. FEUR: I wanted to apologize.
CLAIRE: You do?
MRS. FEUR: For scaring you like I did. When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
CLAIRE: And then you weren't there.
MRS. FEUR: Right. I'm sorry.
CLAIRE: Would you like some iced tea?
MRS. FEUR: Very much.
MRS. FEUR: Your house is so beautiful.
CLAIRE: Thank you.
MRS. FEUR: And these roses. They're much prettier up close.
