Does anyone else still stress out and feel embarrassed over things that happened 10-20 years ago?
I'm almost 30 years old and I still lay awake at night, feeling like a complete idiot of myself when I was 10-16 years old. Then I realize how stupid it is to even care, but it doesn't really help.

How do you get past this stuff?
