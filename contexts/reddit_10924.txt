I wish I could be legally euthanized
I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar subtype. Medication works for me only some of the time, and the side effects make it so that even when I am sane I am trapped in a state of joyless sedated apathy. Antipsychotics took every last little bit of imagination and happiness I had left and now I am a shell who literally goes to work, comes home, and stares at the wall until I can fall asleep. I am 25 and have been sick for over 10 years now - how am I supposed to keep going for another 40 years like this, poor, barely able to work, still surrounded by hallucinations on the regular because the horrible medications don't even work properly on me. If I take my meds, life becomes a chore that offers no relief. If I don't take my meds, I have crazy states of mania and hallucinations and end up jobless and alone. I feel like this illness stole everything from me. I wish I could go to the doctor and tell them, I am incurably mentally ill and I would like to die, and be offered an option for a peaceful death. I wish that there was an end to this suffering.
