Use SIM card on international roaming only for voice calls (sans mobile data) I would like to know whether I can use my iPhone 6 with Pakistani SIM card to make and receive phone calls while roaming in UK. I would not like to consume any mobile data (for Internet/background activity).I wish to use the SIM card solely for making and receiving phone calls. I would only like to use Internet via free Wi-Fi whenever it is available.Is it possible to use my SIM card on international roaming on my iPhone 6 this way? I wish to minimize international roaming costs.
