WHEELER: But you haven't put in for emigration.
DECKARD: Nope.
WHEELER: You're going to be over the limit.
DECKARD: Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
WHEELER: What if you change your mind?
DECKARD: They'll change the limit before I change my mind.

WHEELER: Too old.
DECKARD: But if you could?
WHEELER: My job is here.
DECKARD: Me too.
