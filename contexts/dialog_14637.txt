KELLY: Besides that.
SEAN: I don't know, what else is there?
KELLY: I know! We can take the gondola ride!
SEAN: The one that goes underwater?
KELLY: Yes, it's great!
SEAN: No, Kelly, I don't want to...
KELLY: Come on, it's fun!
SEAN: Not for me. I don't go in the water, remember?
KELLY: You're not in the water. You're in a gondola.
SEAN: No, think of something else.
KELLY: Sean, this is ridiculous. You're acting very immature.
SEAN: I'm not acting! I don't want to go in it, okay?
