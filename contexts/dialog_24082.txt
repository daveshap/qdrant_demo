CHRISTY: How?
EDDIE: Long story. His goons will be here any minute. We've got to get you out of here '- now!
CHRISTY: I can't go with you.
EDDIE: What?
CHRISTY: I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral. We're singing for the Cardinals.
EDDIE: You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
MARY PATRICK: Mary Clarence! Sister!
MARY ROBERT: It's no use. She just isn't here.
