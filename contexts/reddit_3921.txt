Deleted all of my online dating profiles for good.
I've come to realize that I just can't properly present myself or my personality in a cohesive and interesting way online. Along with that, it was starting to take a negative toll on my self image and worth. To me, it's time to pull the plug when I feel like I'm not getting anywhere with no responses from potential matches and felling unattractive and ugly. I don't know, maybe my standards are too unrealistic, but real human interaction has always worked out better for me then on the internet anyway. So I guess I'll have to get out and do this the old fashioned way.
