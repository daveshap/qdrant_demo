Currently failing at life and ready to give up
I’ve been struggling for the past five years on a chemistry degree and it’s has not been going all too well, granted a lot of terrible events happened that caused a massive decline in my performance over the years but I can’t help but feel it’s my fault.

See, one might ask “why didn’t you just leave after one year” the truth is I couldn’t, this was my passion my dream it was the only subject I thoroughly enjoyed doing and I was determined to prove to everyone that I am as smart as they thought I was, but now it’s nothing but a thorn in my side. Recently read and article that said in summary don’t do what you love but do what you are good at and it makes a lot of sense, I started out doing what I love and then grew to hate it whilst realizing I was never good at it. 

Should I quit or continue pushing for the degree? I’ve already spent five years trying and after the final exam I had today I really sit know anymore.
