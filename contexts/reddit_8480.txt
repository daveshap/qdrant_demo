What is the goal of "burqa bans" and are they effective in achieving that goal?
It seems that [Denmark](http://m.independent.ie/world-news/denmark-set-to-become-latest-european-country-to-ban-the-burqa-36203002.html) will become the latest country, joining France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, and the German state Bavaria, to have some level of "burqa ban". Burqa bans, for the purposes of this question, include the legislation in France banning the wearing of face coverings in public(It's hard to find the text in english, but [this source](http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/france-law-prohibiting-the-wearing-of-clothing-concealing-ones-face-in-public-spaces-found-constitutional/) gives "The law reviewed by the Constitutional Council provides that 'no one, in a public space, may wear clothing intended to conceal the face.'"), the potential ban in Denmark that is not written yet, but seems to be along the lines of the French one and any other legislation in western countries that has had similar effect(most burqa bans seem to be part of larger public face-covering bans). 

The most stated popular reasonings behind the ban appear to be [social cohesion, or protecting women's rights](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/europe/burqa-burkini-bans/index.html) and [security, or the suppression of radical islam](http://www.newsweek.com/burqa-ban-european-peoples-party-france-582312), though some wearers of the garments say the problems are being made up.

So, before bans were put in place [around 2010-11](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/14/headscarves-and-muslim-veil-ban-debate-timeline), was there any reason to believe that the bans would result in greater social cohesion, security, or women's rights? After the bans is there reason to believe the countries that implemented them have had greater security, social cohesion or women's rights than they would have had otherwise?
