DETECTIVE STERN: This is Detective Stern with the arson unit. We have some new information about the incident" at your condo."
JACK: Yes?
DETECTIVE STERN: I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
JACK: No, I wasn't aware...
JACK: I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
DETECTIVE STERN: Does this sound strange to you?
JACK: Yes, sire, strange. Very strange.
DETECTIVE STERN: The dynamite...
JACK: Dynamite?
DETECTIVE STERN: Yes. It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
JACK: What does that mean?
DETECTIVE STERN: It means it was homemade.
JACK: This is... really a shock...
DETECTIVE STERN: Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion. The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
JACK: Who do you think could've done this?
DETECTIVE STERN: I'll ask the questions, son.
