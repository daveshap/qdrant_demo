I’m 17. I need advice.
To everyone else I’m strong, confident, a leader. I walk around like nothing bothers me and I just live my life. When I’m alone. That whole persona of me shatters. I turn into this alone, Unhappy, Hurt, toxic person. I don’t know why it happens. I don’t know how to fix it. I hurt the people closest to me. I admit it’s a problem. I just wanna fix it.
