So happy to see collegeboard slowly lose its grasp on college admissions.
UCs just dropped test requirements and will go test blind in a few years. Many schools including MIT and Caltech went subject test blind. This year's APs will carry almost no weight in admissions, even less than before. We are finally stepping in the right direction!

Edit: I'm personally not against standardized tests. It's the only thing keeping people from bullshitting their way into top schools. I am just glad that the power is being taken off of collegeboard's hands.
