macOS Japanese Hiragana-only input On Windows's Japanese IME, when typing Hiragana, I can change the conversion mode to \"No conversion\and then the romaji I type are entered as hiragana without having to press space or enter. Is there any way to do this on macOS (particularly High Sierra)?For example, on Windows (with this setting), I can type \"\u3072\u3089\u304c\" into my search engine of choice and press enter to get the search. But on macOS, I have to press enter twice (once to accept the hiragana without conversion, and once to search).Some kind of work-around would also be of interest. I type a lot of pure-hiragana when studying.
