VINCENT: You son-of-a-bitch...
SAM: What?
VINCENT: You speak French.
SAM: What of it?
VINCENT: Nothing...
VINCENT: Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you."
SAM: You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it. You stepped in front of a bullet for me. I owe you a heavy debt.
VINCENT: I know.
SAM: You better get some sleep, alright?
VINCENT: Tell me something first. The package: what was it?
SAM: I don't know. Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us. There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
VINCENT: What happened to it?
SAM: Gone. Destroyed.
VINCENT: I guess that's for the best.
