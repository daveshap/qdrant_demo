DETECTIVE CAVALLO: So you admit it?
TED: Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it. The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
DETECTIVE CAVALLO: Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
TED: Jeez, I didn't catch it.
