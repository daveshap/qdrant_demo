What if electrons were used in gold foil experiment? I was studying Rutherford's gold foil experiment from my high school textbook. It states that ' by performing experiments in which fast electrons instead of alpha particles are projectiles that bombard target made up of various elements the sizes of nuclei of various elements have been accurately measured.' I  am totally confused with this statement. I know that original experiment used the fact that distance of closest approach for the alpha particles was used to infer the size of nucleus. But how electrons can lead to more accurate results? What I would think and what I have found from other sources is something like this.... If electrons were used then they due to their size and charge they would have got easily affected by the electrons of the atom that come in their way. In fact due to the fact that alpha particles are positively charged and have significant mass they could overcome the interactions with the electrons. Then what the author intends to say. Or what is wrong with my thought process? Someone please explain.
