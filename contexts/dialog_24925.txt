NORMAN: Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
BETH: I love secrets.
NORMAN: That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
BETH: I've read it twice, Norman. It's brilliant.
NORMAN: It's bullshit. The report's a joke.
BETH: That's quite a secret.
NORMAN: I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone. Seriously. I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
BETH: Do yourself a favor, Norman. Are you listening? Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
NORMAN: C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
BETH: Because when we get down there --
NORMAN: Wait -- down where?
BETH: To the spacecraft. To investigate.
NORMAN: Underwater?
BETH: What do you expect? For them to bring it up here?
NORMAN: We can't go down there. We're not prepared. That deep? That takes years of training, Beth. We're just scientists. Lab scietists. We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
BETH: Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here. In the ocean. 70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman. That's first grade geography.
NORMAN: It never occurred to me.
BETH: Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made. Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
NORMAN: The timing has never seemed quite right.
BETH: Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that? Don't jeopardize this.
NORMAN: What -- are you threatening me?
