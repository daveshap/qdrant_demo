Managers: How long until you fire entry-level new hires for underperforming?
I have no reason to believe I’m in danger of getting fired, partially because I’ve only received neutral feedback on my work, partially because they’ve been trying to fill that role for a while, it’s only my second week, and because I was recruited as opposed to applying. On the other hand, I know myself to be someone who needs to improve in attention to detail. Because I’m relatively new, I’ve been given leniency but obviously that can’t continue forever. I’ve been working on attention to detail but I’ve only seen slow improvements. So, managers, if someone makes mistakes as a new hire, how long until you fire them?
