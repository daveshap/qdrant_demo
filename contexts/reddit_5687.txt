Thinking of going back to my old job thoughts?
Ok so I'm used to working retail! I worked at certain job (dont wanna mention which one it is) for 3 years and enjoyed working there! I ended up quitting cause I was moving up north but two months before I quit I had a huge mental break down! I would randomly cry and had panic attacks which made me mess up a huge order! Everyone understood but still I get embarrassed thinking about it! Anyway it's been a bit more then two years, I'm back south and  wanna go back! My supervisor said I'm always welcome back but that was 2 years ago! There was also a certain incident that happend to me which I thought was crazy! But dont wanna talk about it! I did give my two week notice! Any thoughts?
