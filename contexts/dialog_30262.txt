GALVIN: The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
LAURA: I think I will.
GALVIN: Jimmy! That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
LAURA: And are they going to get it?
GALVIN: They might. Yes. That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
LAURA: Maybe what?
GALVIN: Maybe I can do something right.
LAURA: And is that what you're going to do? Is that what you're going to do...?
GALVIN: That's what I'm going to try to do.
