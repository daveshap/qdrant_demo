ALEXANDER: Why?
OVERLORD: We have lost the capacity to reproduce. But the species must continue.
ALEXANDER: So you take their best...
OVERLORD: When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool. We're breeding them for submission. Soon they will be fully domesticated.

OVERLORD: She won't remember you. None of them will. You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
ALEXANDER: A man can change his history.
OVERLORD: After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
OVERLORD: Now will you go?
ALEXANDER: No...
