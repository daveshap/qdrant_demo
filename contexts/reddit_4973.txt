Old ugly and alone
I'm new to the whole reddit thing so I apologise in advance but I just have no place else to turn to. I've been alone for so long, haven't even had a date since my early 40s. I get up go to work, come home, walk the dogs, then watch some TV before repeating the process. My kid lives out of state and if it weren't for my dogs I'd probably loose it. I don't know where I'm going with this little rant, I guess I just needed to say it out loud. Sorry for taking up your time
