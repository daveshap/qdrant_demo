JULIA: How was your tour?
FRANK: The usual.
JULIA: Butch called.
FRANK: Did he?
JULIA: He did.
FRANK: It was under control, Bud. Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
JULIA: Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
FRANK: Okay, start pedaling.
JOHNNY: Daddy put the wheels back on. I'm gonna fall.
FRANK: Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
JOHNNY: Daddy, I'm scared.
FRANK: C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
