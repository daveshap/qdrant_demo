GEORGE: I aimed high.
KURT: We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know. I liked your dad more than I liked you.
ALYSSA: I wouldn't want you as a friend.
KURT: George just never really...aimed that high. Even with not hitting a rabbit. I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun. It was always like you were frightened. Quiet and boring.
ALYSSA: Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
KURT: He builds models for architects. His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal. Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
GEORGE: Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
KURT: Left you this place.
GEORGE: It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
KURT: Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it! I can't afford dirt in this town. I live in Riverside, Goddammitt And you get to piss in the ocean.
KURT: Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot. I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
GEORGE: Thanks for telling me.
KURT: At least your father tried, George.
