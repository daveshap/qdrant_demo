JIM: No. I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
LIZ: But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
JIM: Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday. You were there, why didn't you say something?
LIZ: Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake. You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
JIM: I'm sorry, but it's important. Clay Shaw is important. I'm sorry.
LIZ: You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too. It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
JIM: Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise. Go ahead without me.
