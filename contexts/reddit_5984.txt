MBA, will it help my career? Unranked vs highly ranked (same AACSB accreditation).
I live in Michigan and currently have a BA in English (long story short, I didn't know what I wanted to do but my parents said I needed a degree so I got one). I work in fundraising as an admin assistant making $46K.

I recently discovered that I enjoy financial math and would love to pursue a career in business finance or maybe financial advising. Not sure as of yet.

Anyways, I've been accepted into the MBA program at Eastern Michigan University. I could have applied at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business but the difference in the cost of the program is astronomical.

Currently, I have student loan debt totaling around $40K. My employer will pay 75% of my tuition. If I go to EMU, I can afford the remaining tuition out of pocket without taking out more loans. If I decided to apply and was accepted to Michigan Ross, I would need to take out more loans.

I only started questioning my EMU decision after I read that an MBA from an unranked program isn't useful...but Michigan Ross is highly ranked...

What should I do? Is the extra debt worth going to a top 20 program? Or would the EMU degree be worth it since I won't accrue more debt and I am changing career paths? Help!!

TL;DR: I've been accepted into the MBA program at Eastern Michigan University, my employer will pay 75% and I can afford the remainder out of pocket. I started questioning going there after I read that MBAs from unranked programs are useless. I could apply to the University of Michigan Ross School of Business but it would mean adding to my $40k current student loan debt. Would it be worth it?
