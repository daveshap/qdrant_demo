Help me with my job interview by describing the importance of college transition programs(orientation, welcome week, etc)
Im interviewing for a position on my campus that manages student staff members in various programs such as orientation day and their first week on campus- "Week of Welcome". This position supervises the students who are hired for these programs. I have extended experience as a staff member in these programs and Im also very involved on campus.

During the interview, I have to "come prepared with a presentation that explains the importance of transition programs (New Student Registration, Week of Welcome, etcâ€¦) for first year students and the friends/families."

I wanted to probe you all for what your thoughts are? What was your experience in these programs? What are some ideas/notes that I should hit?
