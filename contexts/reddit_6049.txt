Uncertain if I should pivot, change careers, or just keep applying like mad?
I've been actively looking for another job since December 2019. I do IT and database management but ideally I'd really prefer to pivot doing IT. Another option would be to take up paralegal work or some kind of legal assisting since I worked in legal recruiting. In February, I almost obtained a position with a not-for-profit here in my city managing their donor database but that went belly up due to COVID19 and had to scrap the position.

In March my current employer docked our pay across the board by a quarter. Last week, they made an announcement that they might have to lay off some people. Although there is a possibility that I'll stay on, I feel that they kind of drew a line in the sand by docking pay but not forcing managing directors to retire. In the meantime, I've got my boomer parents telling me to "just go back to school and get another degree." Probably not the best thing for someone who is 35, divorced, and with two kids.

Does anyone have any advice? I've been applying like mad and I'm at my wits end.
