MICHAEL: We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
SAM: What about Mom?
MICHAEL: No! We can't tell Mom! Please, Sam. Don't tell her.
SAM: I don't know, Michael. This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
MICHAEL: Just for a few days, Sam. Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
LUCY: Sam! What happened!? You had me scared to death. Are you all right?
SAM: Sorry, Mom. It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window. I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
LUCY: Where's Michael?
SAM: He's already gone to bed.
