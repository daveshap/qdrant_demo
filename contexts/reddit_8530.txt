Is there a specific meaning to "more than circumstantial" when describing evidence?
Recently Rep. Adam Schiff said [in an interview](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/schiff-more-circumstantial-evidence-trump-associates-colluded-russia-n737446) "there is more than circumstantial evidence now" relating to the ongoing Trump/Russia collusion accusations. 

He was [backed up](http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2017/03/23/another-intel-dem-confirm-trump-russia-evidence-more-than-circumstantial.html?via=desktop&source=copyurl) by Rep. Mike Quigley a few days later (although Quigley wasn't quoted as using the exact same phrase), and now I'm seeing the phrase "more than circumstantial" pop up on Reddit and other social media. 

Is "more than circumstantial" a common way to describe evidence? Does it have any specific meaning in a legal context? 

More generally, how many various levels or classifications of evidence (in a legal sense) are there? I know of direct evidence and circumstantial evidence - is there any in between? Any additional ways to classify evidence on this spectrum?
