JOE: Lotta rich women back there...
RALPH: Yeah?
JOE: Men, they mostly faggots.
RALPH: Must be some mess back there.
JOE: Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
RALPH: Ain't gonna collect your pay?
JOE: I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money... He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
