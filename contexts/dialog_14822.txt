JERRY: Hi.
JERRY: Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?

JERRY: I'm glad you're home. That alone" thing is... not my specialty..."

JERRY: Yeah. That too. I broke up with Avery.
DOROTHY: Too bad.
JERRY: Better now than later. We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.

JERRY: And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
DOROTHY: Sorry. Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
JERRY: Do you have something to drink?
DOROTHY: Sure --
