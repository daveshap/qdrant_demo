JOHN HARPER: Dad, you're bleeding...
BEN HARPER: Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
JOHN HARPER: Yes, Dad.
BEN HARPER: You understand?
JOHN HARPER: Not even her?
BEN HARPER: You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. I will guard Pearl with my life...""
JOHN HARPER: I will guard Pearl with my life...
BEN HARPER: ...and I won't never tell about the money.""
JOHN HARPER: And I won't never tell about the money.
PEARL HARPER: You, Pearl. You swear too.
PEARL HARPER: Who's them Blue Men yonder?
JOHN HARPER: Blue men.
