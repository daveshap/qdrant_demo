LISA: Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?
JESSE: I'm fine. Nothing's wrong.
LISA: you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here. You had another nightmare, didn't you?
JESSE: yeah, I had a bad night.
LISA: You want to talk about it?
JESSE: My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
