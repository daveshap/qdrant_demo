LYNNE: Why did you call me? The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
ANDY: Gosh. Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
ANDY: Hi...
LYNNE: Hi... am I late?
ANDY: No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
ANDY: Popcorn?
LYNNE: No thanks.
ANDY: I really want one. One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
LYNNE: Andy, the theater's that way!
ANDY: Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through On Golden Pond.""
