VAUGHAN: I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
DOYLE: Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
LINDA: He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
DOYLE: But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
VAUGHAN: Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
DOYLE: Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
