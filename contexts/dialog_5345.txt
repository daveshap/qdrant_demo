GAGGI: Frankie, I want to ask you something.
GAGGI: It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
MARINO: Of course, Remo.
GAGGI: I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
MARINO: I always tell you the truth, Remo.
GAGGI: Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
MARINO: What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
MARINO: Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
MARINO: So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
MARINO: No. I ain't see anything like that.
GAGGI: Are you sure?
MARINO: I'm positive. Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
GAGGI: Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
MARINO: Hm.
GAGGI: I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
MARINO: He's good. He's fine.
GAGGI: I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
MARINO: No problem.
GAGGI: You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
MARINO: I understand.
GAGGI: Okay. Frankie, you're a good boy.
