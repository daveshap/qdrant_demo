Which Hector will be most effective with a Distant Counter/Vantage build? I have two Hectors, one will be inherited by someone else so they can get his Distant Counter skill. Hector #1: -Atk, +Spd: I've had this Hector for a while, so he's got all the inherited skills, etc, no need for me to farm SP. My thinking is that this Speed boon will prevent Hector from being doubled as often or even occasionally get a double in, which would increase his survivability.Hector #2: +Def, -Res: While this Hector doesn't suffer an Attack bane, I fear that the Resistance bane might put this Hector in a situation where he's not as tanky as my current one, due to his already-low Resistance being even further decreased.As an aside, my current Hector is running Distant Counter + Vantage.My current one already does pretty well at killing things, so I feel like I should keep him as is, and use #2 for inheriting, but I'm curious whether the effort required to bring Hector #2 up to speed will be worth it. Does the second Hector utilize my build effectively enough to warrant farming all the SP required to recreate this build or is the difference between these two negligible?
