MICHAEL: Do you know where David took me tonight, Star? Do you?!
STAR: Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
MICHAEL: That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood! David's blood. I'm one of them, Star! I'm just like them!
STAR: Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
MICHAEL: Why not?
STAR: Because I love you...
MICHAEL: Then it's not too late for us...
STAR: It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
MICHAEL: I know, I've felt it...
STAR: I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
STAR: David's looking for me... I have to go.
MICHAEL: You're not going anywhere... Sam...
MICHAEL: Star.
SAM: Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
MICHAEL: Who are you calling?
SAM: The Marines.
EDGAR: Okay. Where's Nosferatu?
EDGAR: The Prince of Darkness.
ALAN: The nightcrawler. The bloodsucker.
EDGAR: El Vampiro.
