ED: Just like I always promised. Now you're among the immortals. You're movie stars.
PAUL MARCO: Here's to Ed. For making us into something.
ED: From today on, our lives are different! We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
DOLORES: I don't know. It's so much money...
ED: Who cares?! We're on a ROLL! These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
DOLORES: But Ed, we're not even married. And you don't have a job.
ED: But <u>you</u> do! And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts. And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
ED: Look on the bright side. If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
DOLORES: Toss us out on our ass.
ED: Exactly.
ED: How 'bout a western? People love westerns.
BELA: But, I don't like horses. Do I have to get on one?
ED: Eh, forget it. What else is big? Teenagers! Jailbait pics! Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
BELA: Who do I play?
ED: Uh, a cop. NO! You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>! He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
BELA: Well... can't I play the romantic part? I'm tired of always being the bad guy. You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo! I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
ED: Sure. Romance, that's great! To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures. Once Glen Or Glenda" takes off
BELA: That's good. I could use the money.
ED: But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see. Mmm. What was your biggest hit?
BELA: Hmm... my biggest hit? That would probably be Dracula.""
ED: Of course!
BELA: Those bastards at Universal. I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
ED: So let's make another Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!"
BELA: We can't. Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
ED: They do? Shoot. There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
ED: Ha-ha! Dr. Acula!
BELA: Dracula?
ED: No! <u>Doctor Acula</u>! You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor! Not a count.
BELA: Ah! This is very exciting.
ED: I gotta type this up, while it's still fresh!
