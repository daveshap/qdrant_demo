What are LGBT rights here in the United States?
In [recent news](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trump-administration-rolls-back-protections-for-transgender-students/2017/02/22/550a83b4-f913-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html?utm_term=.43c777e0404e), Trump administration revoked a guideline about transgender students choosing which gender bathroom they to use. I saw a lot common talking about protection for vulnerable transgender students and how this move is an attack on the rights of LGBT groups in the United States. 

[“Attacking our children . . . is no way to say you support and respect LGBTQ people,” said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trump-administration-rolls-back-protections-for-transgender-students/2017/02/22/550a83b4-f913-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html?utm_term=.43c777e0404e)

["We all know that Donald Trump is a bully, but his attack on transgender children today is a new low," said Rachel Tiven, chief executive of Lambda Legal, which advocates for LGBT people.](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-lgbt-idUSKBN161243)

My question is, what exactly are the rights of LGBT? Do they have any rights that general population don't have? Do they not have any rights that general population have?
