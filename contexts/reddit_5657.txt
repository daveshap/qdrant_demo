Unemployed for 4 months. Only 2 months left before the unemployment benefits end. I've only had 1 interview in all this time. I'm starting to panic!
Hello everyone. 

Last year I went through 3 jobs. I had made a career switch last April but realized I wasn't interested in the new career. 6 months later I quit and got a pretty decent job in my original field - Public Health. However, I was fired after only a month. I was not fired for being a bad employee. My performance had nothing to do with it, and if I had made it past the 6 month probationary period then I probably would have been successful with my wrongful termination claim.

I was successful in getting 6 months of unemployment benefits and a part time job at a fabric store, but I haven't been successful in finding a new job. 

I've reworked my resume 3 times, but I still haven't gotten any bites. I've got a bachelor's degree in Public Health, 3 years of experience in my field, a lot of experience in Administrative work, high proficiency in Microsoft Office and Adobe, and all of that is on there. 

I'm worried that the mistake I'm making is putting my 1 month long position on there and leaving my 6 month long position off. Am I just making it look like I have 2.5 years of experience, a 6 month gap, a month of good work, and then nothing for the last 4 months? Would it be better to take that last job off and put the 6 month long job on there even though it was entry level and I hated it? 

What else could I be doing wrong? Someone told me Linked In is absolutely essential, but I don't really have many professional contacts to add on there. 

I'm insanely lost and really desperate to find something. Please help me.
