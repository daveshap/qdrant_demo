STILGAR: Sayyadina. Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest. She asks that you pass within.
JESSICA: They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen. I will try to pass within.
STILGAR: Death may be the result.... Are you sure?
JESSICA: I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
