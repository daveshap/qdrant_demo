Gentle Reminder to Brush Your Teeth
Had to go to the dentist due to an abcess and a tooth needing an immediate root canal. Went back and they are now saying 3k for all the work needed. 

Ill be making it through the treatment and payment plans over the next forever. 

But this is a gentle reminder to brush your teeth or swish some mouth wash. 

Been in a bad spell of depression for the last year and a half but Im in therapy now and we will see how it helps. But like many I stopped doing anything to take care of myself
 This is the hardest to break out of but seeing this as my result is upsetting. Knowing there is a solution is helpful. I just have to make it through to the end
