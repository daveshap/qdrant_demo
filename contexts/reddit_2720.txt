Furloughed for 3 months then fired for performance issues. What to do next?
I was furloughed due to the pandemic slowing down business back in April. When I was furloughed I was specifically told that this what not due to performance issues; that it was simply a business decision, and they were going to fight for me to get back to work as soon as possible. This furlough was not supposed to last past July. Recently I finally get notified of a meeting to discuss ending the furlough, and I'm told that I am being let go due to performance related issues, when I left on a good note, and have not even been working!

Come to find out, while I was gone my boss threw me under the bus, and told everyone that certain projects were not done on time due to having to redo my work. When in reality I had been in constant communication with my manager about the status of these projects, and repeatedly asked for meetings to discuss advancing the projects to the next stages which were then postponed. Not to mention we had been forced to work a reduced hour work week, all the while of transitioning to work from home.

I had been told throughout my time with the company that my hard work was appreciated, and been praised for a job well done. It is very upsetting to me that I was not even given the dignity of a lay off. 

But the reason for my post...
Is there any recommendations someone can provide on what to do next? 

I just feel blind sided/betrayed, and I'm just trying to figure out where to go from here.

Any feedback is appreciated, thank you.
