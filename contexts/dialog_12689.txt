MCCLEOD: I don't have any answers for you.
JENNIFER: Who was that man last night?
MCCLEOD: I don't know.
JENNIFER: Then how did he know your name?
JENNIFER: Do you always walk around with a sword?
MCCLEOD: New York is dangerous place.
JENNIFER: You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions. I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
MCCLEOD: About what?
JENNIFER: It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
MCCLEOD: I'm interested in mythology.
JENNIFER: Have you ever heard of the Calan?
MCCLEOD: No.
JENNIFER: You look like you have.
