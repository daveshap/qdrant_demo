AUSTIN: I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
BASIL EXPOSITION: Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
AUSTIN: You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
VANESSA: Really, Austin!
AUSTIN: Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
BASIL EXPOSITION: All right, Austin, I think you should go.
AUSTIN: I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
BASIL EXPOSITION: I'm leaving! Oh, and Austin?
AUSTIN: Yes, Basil?
BASIL EXPOSITION: Be careful.
AUSTIN: Thanks.
VANESSA: Austin, may I have a word with you?
AUSTIN: Of course, luv.
VANESSA: Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
AUSTIN: Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
VANESSA: I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
AUSTIN: Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
VANESSA: No, did you use a condom?
AUSTIN: Only sailors use condoms, man.
VANESSA: Not in the Nineties.
AUSTIN: Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port. Alotta meant nothing to me.
VANESSA: Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
AUSTIN: It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
VANESSA: You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
AUSTIN: Hello, luv.
VANESSA: Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
AUSTIN: Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
VANESSA: Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
AUSTIN: Out and about, doing odds and sods.
VANESSA: I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
