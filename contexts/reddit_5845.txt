What do CS/software employers look for when hiring university interns?
I'm deciding between two Canadian universities for CS (McMaster and UofT). UofT is the better program thats much more prestigious but it is much more difficult and stressful. McMaster on the other hand has mixed reviews (but current students are happy), and is much easier relatively (thus I have more free time to work on my own CS projects.

My main question is:

When looking for internships as a student, do employers care about your university name/GPA more or your side projects and skills? Does an okay GPA (at a hard school) scare employers? Similarly, does a high GPA (at an easier school) help a ton?

All feedback, advice, and experiences are extremely appreciated! Feel free to add ANYTHING else you would feel is helpful! Thanks!
