My bf has depression and I don't know what to do
We have a long 8 year relationship, so we know each other very well, but since my boyfriend was diagnosed with depression last year and started medication things have been a little bit difficult to handle. So, it's been almost two weeks since we don't have a real conversation. He is avoiding me and avoiding physical touch. I know that I am not a very warm person and I am lazy sometimes. He said he was feeling lonely and he thinks we may have lost something in our relationship, and I was feeling very lonely too but tried not to talk about it because I thought that his problemas were more important and I shouldn't bother him with my feelings of loneliness and sadness since he's already struggling with depression. But I am so confused because yesterday he said that he was avoiding contact and that may be a medication collateral effect, and I should be patient. But I am so confused. I don't know what to do to help him or cheer him up, since he doesn't want me around, and at the same time I don't have anyone to talk to, I am also feeling lonely and apatetic and can't even talk to him about it. I am feeling so lost and have cried almost every night and he doesn't seem to care. What the hell is going on with my life?
