EARL: We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
BOOTH: Suppose someone knows about the money? They're bound to ask questions.
EARL: Who's going to question us? Dwayne? Jesse?
BOOTH: It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
EARL: I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
BOOTH: What makes you so sure?
EARL: Because...I know.
EARL: It's no accident we stumbled on this money. It's an answer to a prayer! Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push. Tonight my prayer came true.
BOOTH: Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
EARL: That's right!
BOOTH: At the expense of six people.
EARL: They killed themselves. Besides, they were breaking the law. What they were doing was wrong! Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
