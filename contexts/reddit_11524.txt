To have a standard 19 year old's problems would be such a blessing.
I made a throwaway because I didn't want this on my normal account, but it doesn't even matter anymore. I was gonna write a really long post. I had it part of the way typed out, but then I realized: there's no way in hell I could possibly list everything that's wrong. I'm 19 and I don't live at home. All the problems a normal adult in poverty would have, I have. Someone kill me, cuz I can't do it myself. PM me if you care.
