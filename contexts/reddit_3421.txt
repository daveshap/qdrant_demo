Probably the most romantic close to a date I've ever had.
Just thought I'd come through with some positivity and get the spirits up in line with the new year. I (27M) went on a date with someone I met on Hinge at the beginning of December and it was probably the best date I've ever had. We had donuts, went bowling, and topped it all off with soul food. At the end I asked to walk her home and she agreed. During the walk we were asking each other arbitrary questions the whole way up until we got to her place where before we parted I asked "So... last question of the night..". She then said "Uh-oh" and I started to panic a little bit and said "Oh man, by your answer that tells me I maybe shouldn't ask it!" and she said "No, it's because I already know the question!". I was a little taken a back but simple responded "Oh? Well... what's the answer then?" and she then grabbed my coat and kissed me. The air was cold and still, and when we were done her ears were red. It was perhaps the most romantic thing I've experienced in a long time.

tldr: Had a great date that ended in a great kiss. 2020 is lookin' up!

Edit: I'm really surprised by the response of this post; and grateful how positive most of it has been. Thank you all. You're too kind. For people having difficulty with matches on certain apps, I've mentioned it a few times but Hinge is perhaps one of the best (in my opinion) for finding a relationship so I would seriously consider it if you haven't already.
