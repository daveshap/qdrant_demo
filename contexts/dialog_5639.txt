REGGIE: Got you.
DYLE: Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
REGGIE: The shower's in there.
DYLE: Reggie -- open the door.
REGGIE: This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
DYLE: Then I suggest you call one of them.
REGGIE: I dare you.
REGGIE: What are you doing?
DYLE: Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on? What a nut.
DYLE: I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
REGGIE: Shut the door!
DYLE: I don't think I know that one.
