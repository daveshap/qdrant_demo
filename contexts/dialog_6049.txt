BERNSTEIN: The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
THOMPSON: It didn't end very well, did it?
BERNSTEIN: It ended - Then there was Susie - that ended, too. I guess he didn't make her very happy - You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
THOMPSON: Yes -
BERNSTEIN: Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had - You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot. I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself. He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
THOMPSON: In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
BERNSTEIN: You don't say! Why I had no idea -
THOMPSON: Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me. Just -
BERNSTEIN: Just old age. It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of. You ought to see Mr. Leland. There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
