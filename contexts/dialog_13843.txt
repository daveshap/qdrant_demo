LOWELL: Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
JIM COOPER'S VOICE: Okay. Lowell?
LOWELL: Yeah?
JIM COOPER'S VOICE: You're sure you want to do this?
LOWELL: Why?
JIM COOPER'S VOICE: Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
LOWELL: You ready...?
JIM COOPER'S VOICE: Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
JIM COOPER'S VOICE: Lowell?
LOWELL: Did I tell you you were wrong?
JIM COOPER'S VOICE: No. I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
MIKE WALLACE: Did I get you up?
LOWELL: No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
MIKE WALLACE: How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
LOWELL: Oh, lots.
MIKE WALLACE: Yeah, that's right.
LOWELL: But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
MIKE WALLACE: I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
LOWELL: I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
MIKE WALLACE: Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
LOWELL: Oh, please, Mike...
MIKE WALLACE: Give me a break!
LOWELL: No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
MIKE WALLACE: In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
LOWELL: Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
MIKE WALLACE: I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?" What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone."
