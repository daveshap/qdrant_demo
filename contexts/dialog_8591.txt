MALLOY: Shut up, Plissken.
PLISSKEN: What's the little black box do?
MALLOY: Top secret. Only on a need to know.
PLISSKEN: And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
MALLOY: That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
PLISSKEN: So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
MALLOY: That's the deal.
PLISSKEN: Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
