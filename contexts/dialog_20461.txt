JUNIOR: Be quiet.
BURNHAM: We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
JUNIOR: They're coughing.
BURNHAM: They're gonna die in there!
JUNIOR: Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea? Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?! Huh? We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes! The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
BURNHAM: Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
JUNIOR: Cut it back a little bit.
RAOUL: No fucking way.
JUNIOR: He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
