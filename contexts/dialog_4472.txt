DIGNAN: You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
BOB: He electrocuted someone?
DIGNAN: It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
BOB: His name was Swifty?
DIGNAN: Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
BOB: That's too bad.
DIGNAN: You know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. At least Swifty's did.
BOB: What are you doing?
DIGNAN: I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
