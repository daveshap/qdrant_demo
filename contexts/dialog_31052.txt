MARIETTA: No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
SAILOR: Whattya mean?
MARIETTA: Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
SAILOR: So?
MARIETTA: So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
SAILOR: You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
MARIETTA: Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
SAILOR: It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
LULA: Sailor!
SAILOR: You up for that?
LULA: I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
SAILOR: Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
LULA: ...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
SAILOR: Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
LULA: You still got plenty energy for me, baby.
