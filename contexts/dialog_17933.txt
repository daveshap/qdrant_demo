ANDERTON: Why did you catch that?
WITWER: Because it was going to fall.
ANDERTON: You're certain?
WITWER: Yes.
ANDERTON: But it didn't fall. You caught it.
ANDERTON: The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
WITWER: You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it. How do the precogs tell the difference?
ANDERTON: The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
WITWER: Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
FLETCHER: Because of the nature of murder. There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another"."
WITWER: Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
ANDERTON: It was Iris Hineman. She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
WITWER: Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
ANDERTON: To Hineman?
WITWER: To them.
ANDERTON: Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
WITWER: Really? You've never been inside?
ANDERTON: We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
WITWER: So I'll be the first one to go in then?
ANDERTON: Maybe you didn't hear me.
WITWER: If it's a question of authority.
ANDERTON: There's no question. You don't have any.
WITWER: I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
