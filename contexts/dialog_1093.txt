BOOKKEEPER: You've really got to go.
BERNSTEIN: Just let me get a match.
BERNSTEIN: But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
BOOKKEEPER: All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
BERNSTEIN: We don't tell anyone that. Which is why you can talk to us. And if we can't verify what you say someplace else, we don't print it. That's another reason you can relax.
BOOKKEEPER: I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
BERNSTEIN: You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
BOOKKEEPER: I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
