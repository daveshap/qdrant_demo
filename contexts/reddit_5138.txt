I keep getting rejected from jobs and I have no idea why.
I've been stuck being underemployed for a while now. I keep applying to jobs and I keep failing to get them. I've had interviews who always just ghost on me. I try to reach out to see how to improve and they never respond or promise to call me right back. One of them I have no idea why I wouldn't of gotten as I thought my experience, interview, and interactions with staff were perfect. I've tried the go getter approach for interviews, which people seem either annoyed or befuddled with, and I have tried the passive which of course results in nothing. It feels like everything I do is a failure and it's really putting me in a bad place. I can't even get a basic customer service job, so I am stuck with my part time gig.

 It is especially hard when I hear comments from other people. People who know me I don't think believe I am trying hard enough because of my background. It's also been difficult because a few jobs have said they are looking for a more diverse candidate, which I understand for some positions but is such punch in the gut. At this point the only thing available for me seems to be working as a field organizer in the upcoming elections, which is the last thing I want to do. It's just long hours with little pay and little to no career advancement. I am the biggest failure right now, being unable to get a career started. I want to think things are getting better, but I am well aware they are not and am ready to throw in the towel. Thanks for listening I just needed to type this out after the most recent rejection, appreciate it and good luck all.
