VICKI: Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
BRUCE: In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
VICKI: As much as I do. It's not that. I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
BRUCE: I see. If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
VICKI: I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
BRUCE: Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it. Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
VICKI: But it's not fair. I'm half drunk and you're not even --
BRUCE: I'll take you home if you'd like.
VICKI: God. You would. Come on, Bruce. I just want to get two drinks in you. As an experiment.
BRUCE: Maybe we should just kiss.
VICKI: ... We could try that.
