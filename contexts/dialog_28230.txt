JEANNE: I am ready now...
AULON: Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
JEANNE: I'm already free...
AULON: Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
JEANNE: My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
AULON: I -- I don't understand...
JEANNE: One day you will.
AULON: You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
AULON: ... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even... ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
JEANNE: I'm staying, Jean.
AULON: No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore... You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
JEANNE: I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
AULON: Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
