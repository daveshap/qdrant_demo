Crosspost from r/GetEmployed: Confessions of a former HR Recruiter
Having worked in Human Resources for the past couple of years, I've come to realize that a lot of the knowledge I take for granted is not exactly the kind of thing most people think of when applying. There are so many minute details that help form a recruiter's opinion of a candidate, and I thought it would be good to write about them in an easily-digestible way.

Any questions / feedback would be highly appreciated as this is sort of a pilot project.
