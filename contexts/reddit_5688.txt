I was let go and I feel a little embarrassed and not sure of next steps.
I was recently **let go 3 weeks ago and I feel embarrassed but I want to move forward so I can score a job soon.** I'm not sure of how to come up with my narrative to friends, network and prospective employers why I was let go in my job search so they can still think positively of me. Please help?

**Why I was let go (background):** I've been at my job close to three years and I hated the job, I hate writing long reports and I didn't like the work I do but I kept going because I didn't know what I want to transition onto next. A lot of independent silent work and little collaboration, which I realize I loved. The company has been going through some changes and a lot of roles have been terminated (though not my department specifically I was only let go, which adds salt to the wound). The only thing that kept me going was the people that were there but a lot of people left (even my managers who voluntarily quit without anything lined up who would've vouch for me). The work load was getting excessive and quality was compromised as my performance hindered. Main things that added to me losing my job is that I missed catching a data mislabel mistake in a large report  before I sent over to the client and being late or missing meetings. I can own up that its partly my fault but I also was so tired of the place and toxic environment and working into the late evenings. The director who I had to work closely with clash with me in terms of personality and often says abusive stuff really lowering my self-esteem. My immediate manager does acknowledge that if I don't like it there I'm not sure why I'm still there.

**One of the things I struggle so much is explaining to networks and friends on my situation or even how I'll approach this in an upcoming interview, it's hard to say to employers I'm just not passionate or I'm simply overworked and tired and environment was not great. I've read online I need to own up to the situation and not blame the company when explaining why I was let go. Any advice on the narrative? Should I update on my LinkedIn now that I don't work there?** They are still paying my severance and won't be updating my record of employment until my last paycheck. **Below is an attempt on how I'll address it, please let me know if you have any better strategies or suggestions.**

**Long answer they ask why I was terminated if HR asks?**: It was not a good fit, a very high-turnover and dysfunctional work environment as the company is going through changes in a new direction. Over the course the last year I was there many people were terminated and left which shifted a projects over my capacity, which I admittedly struggled and really affected my performance. I learned that work life balance and culture is important to me though I understand there are times where certain milestones that requires extra time. I do prefer an environment where there is regular engagement and collaboration instead of silos.

\- the problem I think with this answer is people leaving and high turnover happens in a lot of companies and they may feel I'm not fit for the job. Thoughts?

**Shorter concise answer (networking or to simplify for others)**: I used to work in market research but I realize it’s not exactly a great fit for me and I’m exploring new career paths in customer experience, project/product management and analytic roles.
