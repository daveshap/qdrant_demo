How to play custom NSMB levels on Wii? I have been messing around with my ancient Wii and found online that I can create and play custom levels. I have created a level with Reggie! and named it 01-01.arc.That's great, but how in the world am I supposed to access it on my Wii? I have installed Homebrew and all that and the Riivolution app correctly (I know this because I am able to play Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii) but I have not found anywhere ANYWHERE how to actually play the levels I create. The videos I watch literally skip from saving the level in Reggie! to the gameplay on the Wii. Please help!
