Capacitor effects I've read about capacitor and its operations, and I'm still confused about this question: lets assume I have circuit which I have source voltage parallel to capacitor and I've waited amount of time till the capacitor is fully charged, so in other words the voltage of the source is equal to the Vc (voltage on the capacitor) ; afterwards I have appended to the circuit a resistor which it's parallel to the capacitor i.e I have now source voltage parallel with charged capacitor and both are paralleled with resistor , my question will the capacitor now flow current to the resistor? if so, how could the capacitor discharge/flow current to the resistor if there's the source voltage on it(it's stable) which supposedly can't flow current to capacitor or from it...my question how could also capacitor after being charged will be discharged although there's a stable voltage source connected to it?!thanks for helpers
