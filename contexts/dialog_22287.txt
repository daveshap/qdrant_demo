ROCKY: ...Can't do it.
ADRIAN: ...What?
ROCKY: ...I can't beat him.
ADRIAN: Apollo?
ROCKY: Yeah, I can't beat him.
ROCKY: I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
ADRIAN: What're we going to do?
ROCKY: ...I dunno.
ADRIAN: Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
ROCKY: It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
ADRIAN: Don't say that.
ROCKY: C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
