Job availability between: Economics, Data Analysis, Statistics
I am looking to go into a masters program would set me up for a career as a researcher, economist, data scientist, data engineer, or statistician for either a private company or the government with the Federal Reserve, Bureau of Labor Statistics or similar branch. My under grad degrees were a BS in Economics and a BS in Statistics. I am looking at programs that range from a MA/MS in Economics, BS in Statistics, and biostatistics programs. How can these different programs set me up in a career? Does anyone have advice or experience in this?
