I Feel Useless & Utterly Incompetent
What a rough beginning to the new year. Well to begin I'm helping my mother run and manage our business (flooring/kitchens). Recently or well sort of recently a restaurant that was near us that brought in the crowds to our location and was essentially a landmark of the city burned down in late October. 

It's now January and looks like we're closing up shop. It sucks, both me and my are full time students to top things off and i have a 10 year old brother to look after. Things financially have been tight. Whatever money I've received from school I've given to my mother to help with the rent and bills. It's frustrating coming to a near empty parking lot every morning stay from morning to evening and nothing comes in. Christmas was a drag tried to save up some cash for some small presents for my mom and brother but my mom needed the money more. Now I start school Tuesday and to be honest I'm terrified, stressed and slightly depressed despite myself trying to keep a positive attitude. 

I don't know how this semester is gonna go, I've been applying to tutoring and I've been working on my cover letter & resume in hopes to land a barista position at Starbucks part time at least. Aside from being competent in Office app's I don't think I really have much to offer. I don't know, it sucks I really feel useless I wish I could do more though I'm trying. I don't know reddit I understand it does no good in just moping but I just really needed to get this out there. I appreciate you guys taking the time to read this.
