EVE: Uh-huh. Adam?
ADAM: Yes, Eve?
EVE: I want you to go back to the hotel now. I'll call you a cab.
ADAM: Of course. I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
EVE: That's right. And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby. Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
ADAM: Not at all. And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
EVE: My pleasure.
ADAM: It was at least as good as the sky.
EVE: Really? Okay!
ADAM: And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
EVE: Neat. Goodnight!
