Is it ok to ask about salary during an interview?
I have my first interview coming up (after my initial phone interview) and I’m curious, is it wrong to ask about salary during an interview? I never have. But in this situation, I have a couple of job opportunities and I want to see if it’s comparable to the others. I obviously wouldn’t say that in an interview, but is there a good way to ask or is it best to avoid?
