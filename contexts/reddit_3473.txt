Why you should have low expectations
M26 am sitting in a coffee shop where I was supposed to meet F20. I stayed out wayyy too late and with the time change I only got 4 hours of sleep and am pretty hungover to be honest. Yet I still made it on time and cleaned up well. She didn't show...

She had some stuff come up and woke up late etc. She did apologize, but is making no effort to reschedule or make up for it. 

My point is that I kinda quit caring lol. I've been at the dating game for so long that I'm pretty carefree about it. Now I'm just chilling out sipping coffee while on reddit curing my hangover lol.

Tl;dr Got stood up so I'm treating myself to a nice date. This is why you have low expectations!

Edit: I did try to confirm the date 1 hour before, I had planned on going to the coffee shop regardless.
