JULIE: Honey, it's not the end of the world. You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up. And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own. You are free now, you are independent.
PHIL: I'm <u>fired</u>. I'm unemployed. Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength? Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
JULIE: That's not the case.
PHIL: Someone blew the whistle. Someone hates me.
HIDER: Things are beginning to come to a head. I can feel it. And I want everything to be perfect.
THERAPIST: Who doesn't?
HIDER: I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
THERAPIST: Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
HIDER: Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too. What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
THERAPIST: It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more. <u>Show</u> your affection.
HIDER: Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
THERAPIST: <u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
HIDER: I should.
THERAPIST: You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
HIDER: Right.
THERAPIST: Because life isn't about playing it safe. Life is about taking risks.
JULIE: Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
PHIL: This is for the best, you know it is. Why do my socks keep disappearing!
JULIE: Honey
JULIE: You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
PHIL: I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
