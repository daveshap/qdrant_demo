ALICE: I love the smell of pine.
MISS CALLAHAN: It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
ALICE: It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year â€” St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
