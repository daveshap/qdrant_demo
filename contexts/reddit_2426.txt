Late bloomers who became successful, what's the best advice you can give to people just starting out?
I'm 24, I don't have a degree yet, and I'm only recently applying for jobs. I'm starting college online in a few months after I start working. Still trying to figure out if I should pick Finance or Marketing as my major. 

Thanks to anyone who replies. Hope you guys have a great day.
