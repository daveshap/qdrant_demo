Don't know where to begin to look for different job opportunities, looking for suggestions
I'm 24, nearly 25, still working on a college degree in computer science, and I've worked 5 different jobs so far: 

* Backroom Coordinator, Homegoods
* Barista, some coffee shop
* Stocker/Cashier, some liquor store
* Barista/Morning MOD, another coffee shop
* Sales Consultant/Tech Specialist, Office Depot

May be relevant, but I also attended a vocational high school and have experience in the Electrical field.

I know once I have my degree, the door to more interesting jobs will open. I also know that internships will become more readily available to me the further into my degree plan I get. But my question to you guys is, looking at my job history, what kind of above-minimum-wage/interesting/challenging work field could I get myself into? Something tech-related ideally, and closer to part-time so I'm able to focus on my education.

I can say for sure I have strong skills and experience when it comes to customer service, multi-tasking, problem solving, self-starting, leadership, and even sales. I am highly experienced as a barista, and I know I could get back into that, but I'm honestly just lost as to what else I could try to branch into (that ISN'T retail) while going to school.
