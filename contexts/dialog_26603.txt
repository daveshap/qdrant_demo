DOLORES: Billy loved to see his kids in the bus. They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
MITCHELL: From what?
DOLORES: From what?
MITCHELL: Did he have any particular problems that you knew of? Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
DOLORES: No, nothing like that. Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago. He took over raising the children by himself. It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
MITCHELL: You talked about it?
DOLORES: No. I saw it on his face.
