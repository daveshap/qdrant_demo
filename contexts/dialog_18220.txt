MONKEYBONE: Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
STU: Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
MONKEYBONE: Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
STU: <i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
MONKEYBONE: Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
STU: No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
MONKEYBONE: You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
STU: All right. You can come.
MONKEYBONE: OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
STU: Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
