Does anyone else also understand that their thoughts are irrational yet they coninue to feel anxious?
I sometimes do understand that my anxiety provoking thoughts are irrational, such as thinking I'll never find a job, but the moment I get as much as a little hint supporting this I'll go back to thinking that I'll really never find a job.
