LOUIS: He can protect us, Claudia.
CLAUDIA: You really believe that?
ARMAND: I was waiting for you...
LOUIS: Listen to me.
LOUIS: Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
ARMAND: Your lover.
LOUIS: No, my beloved, my child.
ARMAND: If you say so. You are innocent.
LOUIS: I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
ARMAND: She is.
LOUIS: But why?
ARMAND: I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
LOUIS: Then blame the one who made her...
ARMAND: Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
LOUIS: We want no quarrel with him.
ARMAND: It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
LOUIS: Then I leave too.
ARMAND: So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
LOUIS: You said there were none.
ARMAND: But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
LOUIS: We can do that?
ARMAND: You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
LOUIS: That's what the one who made me said.
ARMAND: How he must have loved you.
