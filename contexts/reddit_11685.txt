I seem to waste my money.
I'm 21 and have a monthly salary of £1250 after tax. I pay £5 a month for a phone bill and approx £200 a month commuting to and from work. Even with these low outgoing costs I still seem to have only a few hundred pounds left St the end of every month but I can't seem to work out how on earth I waste this much money. 

I've tried tracking my spending but it's just too much of a pain to be worrying about a few pounds here and there. 

I really want to save up the money to learn to drive and save up for a holiday in the summer but I need a better way of saving my cash.
