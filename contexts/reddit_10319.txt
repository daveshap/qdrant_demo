will someone read this?
no. no one will. no one cares about me. why am i still typing? goodbye world

edit: i post on this sub when i’m really lonely. i’m thankful that people did read this. i really am. i was saying that because i know that us usually other people’s posts go unanswered. it really sucks and i was worried the same would happen to me. i do my best to respond to other people’s posts that don’t have any responses. thank you guys so much for responding. thank you guys so much. it means so much to me.
