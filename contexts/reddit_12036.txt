I feel like my generation and those to follow are destined for failure and misery.
Overpopulation, advancements in robotics ruining job opportunities, climate change, economic stability, the loss of moral values in the general populous, a society that grows more and more dependent on antidepressants to function, etc. Life is hard enough for most of us, but my god we are just wrecking any hope for a pleasant future our children might ever have.
