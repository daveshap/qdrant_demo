Top of my company now, but in a small business. Would I need to apply for lower positions when looking for a different job?
For a bit of a background, I work for a small business right now as an Executive Director. I'll be 100 percent honest in that I gave myself that title basically so I could sign any required forms and also speak to clients/contacts. I work in a small nonprofit, and I do essentially run the entire thing as my board is not always helpful (I don't totally blame them as I get a salary, they do not -- they also have their own full-time jobs). I take care of every aspect of the business including calls, bookkeeping, budgeting, client meetings, marketing, grant writing, IT issues, etc.  This nonprofit is pretty successful and we have been around for about 4 years.

On top of this, I also help the CEO of a company who we share office space with in running his small business. It includes many of the same tasks, but also a lot of graphic design and overall program management.

I am not actively seeking a new job as of yet, but am opening myself to the idea of it. With both of these companies being small business and also family owned, I fear that they have an expiration date within the next five years. I'd like to stay as long as possible because I am learning a lot since I essentially have responsibilities in every aspect of each business. I don't know that I'd have that in a bigger company with a more defined position.  At the same time, I don't want to wait until it's too late (the companies go out-of-business/sell/close) to start looking.

What I am confused about, is what kind of jobs would I look for? I don't believe I have the experience to be an ED in a large organization, but I think I could certainly do more than an administrative level too.  I enjoy the nonprofit sector, and work in healthcare, but I would probably want to get out of healthcare if I were to seek a different career path because at times, healthcare can be a little soul crushing. Before this I answered phone lines for a help desk. My friends/family say I undersell myself, but I know it's a big difference from going to a startup company to something larger. I feel that I'd have to look for lower positions. Sorry that was long, thanks for your input.

TLDR:  Work as Executive Director in small business, do I need to look for a lower position if looking for a career in a larger sized company? If so, what kind of position?
