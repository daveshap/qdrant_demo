Anexiety folks out here, how do you deal with starting a new job?
I am not exactly sure i am at the right sub reddit but i am so anxious right now i just wanna let it out.

Little back story. I never worked before. Finished highschool not too long ago so of course i decided to look for a job. I only have a highschool diploma cause i was dumb and have to pass some exams next year so i can go to college but until then i'm stuck with my only work possibility of retail or stuff like that.

I did try to work a lil while ago and literally only lasted through the first day, the next day i was supposed to come i had like the biggest anxiety attack and was so scared i just stopped going.

And it's happening again, tomorrow is supposed to be my first day at a new place and i'm scared i won't last even that one. My brain just goes to full panic mode and i just wanna call them and say that my grandpa died oe whatever excuze just so i won't go because i literally feel like crying right now.

I really don't wanna be like this and actually work because i need to do something and i need the money to actually start something that i like to do but even that motivation is not enough for me to not act like this.

Please help this dumb dumbass over here cause i'm going crazy i swear.

TL;DR: i am dumb and too anxious to go to my work place.
