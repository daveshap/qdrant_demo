BOWMAN: Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
POOLE: Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
BOWMAN: Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
POOLE: I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
BOWMAN: But not completely inconceivable?
POOLE: I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
BOWMAN: I guess it isn't.
POOLE: Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.

BOWMAN: Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
POOLE: Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
HAL: I will if I can, Frank.
POOLE: Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
HAL: True.
POOLE: Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
HAL: That's true.
