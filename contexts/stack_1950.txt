Is there a term for a coined word that gives meaning by association? Bear with me as this is hard to articulate. Is there a word or term that describes when a coined word has obvious or intended meaning by being similar to another word, or having a certain \"feel\" to it? I'm thinking onomatopoeia but for meaning.The best example I can think of from the top of my head is \"Orgastic\" in The Great Gatsby. Forgive me if I'm wrong, but the word is coined for the use, and while it's meaning is left ambiguous, you learn all you need to know about the meaning by the feel and similarity to the other word.Full quote: <blockquote>  Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that\u2019s no matter\u2014tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And then one fine morning\u2014  So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</blockquote>
