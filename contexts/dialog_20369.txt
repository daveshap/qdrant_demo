BURDON: There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you. Buddy is it? And this fella Jack Foley. I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
KAREN: Really? Huh. He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
BURDON: You talked to him?
KAREN: In the trunk, yeah?
BURDON: What'd you talk about?
KAREN: Oh... different things, prison, movies.
BURDON: This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
KAREN: It was an unusual experience.
BURDON: Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks. You recall that?
KAREN: When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
BURDON: Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you. So you had to at least suspect him.
KAREN: And what happened to Carl?
BURDON: The time came, you shot him. But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him. They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand. You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down. But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
KAREN: Is that what you would've done?
BURDON: You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
KAREN: Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers.
BURDON: Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
KAREN: Have you ever shot a man? How many times have you been primary through the door?
BURDON: I have to qualify, is that it?
KAREN: You have to know what you're talking about.
BURDON: We'll talk another time, Karen. All right? I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
KAREN: You'll have to ask him.
BURDON: Sounds to me like he liked having you around. I'll see you, Karen. Mr. Sisco.
