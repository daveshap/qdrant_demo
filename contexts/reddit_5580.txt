Looking to get into IT
I’m wondering what “path” is right for someone interested in computer hardware. I’m pretty new to qualifications so I don’t know the differences between things like comptia network and security. I guess I’m just looking for a useful link or starting place to learn what qualifications are right for me. I don’t expect anyone to have a perfect answer but I’m just looking for a good place to start and learn.
