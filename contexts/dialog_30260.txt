GALVIN: We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
MICKEY: You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
GALVIN: Admittance form is wrong.
MICKEY: Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
GALVIN: I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
MICKEY: ...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book, 'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.' ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'
GALVIN: They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
MICKEY: No.
GALVIN: 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
MICKEY: Right.
GALVIN: Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
MICKEY: Right.
GALVIN: Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
MICKEY: You got a good memory, Franky.
GALVIN: I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport...
GALVIN: Jimmy? Bushmills. Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
MICKEY: Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
GALVIN: I'm going to get laid.
