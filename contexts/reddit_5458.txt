Need advice getting back into computer science field
I graduated from a computer science and technology program 4 years ago in college. I had an internship in app development but didn't feel like the field was right for me at the time. Since then I've been working in a few IT help desk jobs and customer service. I feel like I am ready to go back to work as a dev.

I know I have to work on putting together an up to date portfolio. However I am not sure if I should attempt to get an internship first or a  an entry level job considering the time gap since  the time I graduated. A part of me is also thinking of going to university but I'm struggling with if it's really worth it.
