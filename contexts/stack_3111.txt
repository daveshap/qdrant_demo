Pressure in a sealed cylinder half-filled with liquid nitrogen, allowed to rise to room temperature? If a cylinder could withstand any pressure how high would the pressure rise if the vessel was filled half full of liquid nitrogen then sealed and then allowed to warm to room temperature? What if allowed to warm to 200 degrees F. Also, what state would the nitrogen be in during this period, liquid/vapor, vapor only, other?
