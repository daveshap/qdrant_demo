CONNIE: Is Kay coming?
MICHAEL: No.
CONNIE: Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama. He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
MICHAEL: Tom is right.
CONNIE: Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
CONNIE: I want to talk to you, Michael.
MICHAEL: The children can stay.
CONNIE: I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years. I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too. But I understand you now; I think I do. You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was. And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now. Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
