BEEMER: Yeah, that's right.
LENNY: I saw you play, man. You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying. So what happened, injuries or what?
BEEMER: Bullshit politics.
LENNY: It's always politics. Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right? But I could pay you more not to. See what I mean? I could write you a check right now--
BEEMER: Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
LENNY: Okay cash! Logical. Here's everything I have on me, what do you say? How about a Rolex?
BEEMER: I already got a real one. Come on, it won't be too bad. It's not personal.
LENNY: Just not the eyes.
