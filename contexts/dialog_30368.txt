LIZ: We've got problems here.
FISHER: Problems?
LIZ: Seating problems.
FISHER: Okay.
LIZ: Keith do not trivialize this.
FISHER: I'm not. What's the problem?
LIZ: We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
FISHER: What kind of seats can we have?
LIZ: Not padded ones.
FISHER: So what do we do?
LIZ: You go down there.
FISHER: Go down where?
LIZ: Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
FISHER: Honey I don't have the time...
LIZ: I need your help.
FISHER: We're leaving in three hours.
LIZ: I need your help.
FISHER: I'll call them from the road.
LIZ: Do you love me?
FISHER: More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
LIZ: Take care of those chairs.
FISHER: We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
LIZ: Maybe.
