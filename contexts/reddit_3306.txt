What the hell should I do?
I’ll give you the broad strokes and add detail as needed if anyone cares to respond to this.

I’m 35 years old.  I have a wife and two kids (4 yrs and 3 months old).  I currently work around 50 hrs/week as a welder.  I make $45,000/year.  I’m the sole bread winner for the family.  Needless to say, money is tight.  We never go without anything we need, but there’s not a lot left over at the end of the month.

I weld because it’s the only think I’m really qualified to do.  I hate it.  It’s mind numbing and hard on me physically.  

I spent most of my early adulthood in the Army.  
I got out with a pretty nasty case of PTSD.  Out of pride I never really sought treatment, instead I self medicated with alcohol.  In the last five years I was convicted of a DUI and 4 public intoxes.  My credit is shit due to poor drunken decisions.

Almost two years ago I broke down and finally went to a 28 day inpatient treatment center for my alcoholism.  I’ve been sober for almost a year now.

This last year of sobriety has brought me a lot of clarity.  I want better for my family and myself.  I think a big part of that will be to improve our financial situation.  I think in order to accomplish that, I’ll need to change career fields.  What kind of training/schooling/internship can someone in my position undertake that will actually make a difference?  

I’m so lost.  I would walk over hot coals if that’s what it took.  I don’t lack ambition or work ethic, but I lack direction.

I would love some advice.
