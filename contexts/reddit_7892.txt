How to find PIs?
Hi! I'm applying to grad school soon. I'm looking at both journalism and women's/gender/feminist studies programs. I'm primarily interested in MA programs, but I am starting to consider a PhD as well. Right now, I'm finishing a dual degree in journalism and gender studies at undergrad.

I completed a major research project here at undergrad where I analyzed the news media through a feminist lens, focusing on racial and gender diversity in newsroom production and audience reception (so, identifying links between who makes the news, who they cover, and who consumes their work). It was accepted for presentation at two conferences. However, I go to a very small school, and the project was very small in scale and only done over one semester. I'd love to continue researching the news media through a feminist lens as a graduate student. I want to go deeper into what I studied before and expand the scope. I'm just not sure how to find someone currently doing this or related research at an institution! 

How do I find a PI? And if I can't find one specifically doing the research I'm interested in, is there any flexibility in deciding my own research path?
