COLE: My notes. Observations. Clues.
RAILLY: Clues? What kind of clues?
COLE: A secret army. The Army of The Twelve Monkeys. I've told you about them. They spread the virus. That's why we have to get to Philadelphia. I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
RAILLY: What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
COLE: I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates. So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure. So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
