My mom thinks you’re all very funny
Last night at like 9:00 pm she asked what goes on on reddit, so I went here and read a few posts to her. She was laughing hysterically. Her favorites were “Reject them before they reject you and “fuck just fuck.” She loved all the memes, especially the one with car skidding to the exit with 1 safety and 12 reaches, opposed to three reach, two safety, and 4 matches. 

We did this for an hour. Thanks guys!

Edit: This response has been awesome! Shout out to all the moms who have gone through this process with us and all the moms who laughed at the memes rather than scorn the rejections ❤️

Edit #2: My mom was bragging that she was popular on reddit and my dad exclaims: "I drop f-bombs when I give advice too! Guess you don't love me..." SO, I wanna say that Dads are awesome too in the college process, especially since mine plays Black Ops 4 with me lol. We suck but we have fun.
