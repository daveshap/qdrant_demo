Might be a wash to post here, but does anyone know what a G3 interview is?
I graduated with my MPH in July. I’m applying for a contracting position for a federal entity, and the next step will be a phone screening interview with the program manager. Under the job description information, it says the interview will “be like a G3”. Does anyone have experience with that? Or know how to adequately prepare?
