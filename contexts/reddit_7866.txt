How important is organic chemistry?
It’s looking like I’m not gonna do too hot in my second semester of organic chemistry. I can recognize that’ll probably stop me from getting into a PhD straight from my undergrad, but what about a masters? I have a bunch of experience, an acknowledgment in a manuscript, and some actual data. Would a poor grade (like 2.0-2.5) really kill my chances like that? I’m interested in doing microbiology research in the future. And if it really is something that’s gonna prevent me I’ll just take it again.
