Forced to disconnect from two good friends, I don't know how to reconnect
I apologise if my English isn't great. 

I have two great online friends. I've known them for a good five years and we've called and texted each other a lot, so naturally I trust them. 
Problem is, my mom doesn't. 
She caught me texting them one night, and the following morning she woke up early, took my phone, and read our conversations. (she does not allow passwords)
She didn't like a lot of things about them, nor did she like the conversations which we had (to be fair, we did use a bit of profanity) Next thing I know, I'm cutting every single contact I have with them. I wasn't even able to tell them what happened, she just wanted them gone and out of my life. 
It's been a while since then, but I've been very sad. They helped me through a lot of stuff in the past, and I had plans to meet them in a few years as well, so it's been very hard to let go. 

Should I continue to let go of them, or should I convince my mom that they're both nice people? I really want to talk to them again, since they were basically there when I had nobody else.
Even if I do decide to convince her, I have no idea how. She's worried about me, and I understand that. but I don't know how to make her feel otherwise about them.
