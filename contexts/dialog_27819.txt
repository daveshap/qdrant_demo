HELEN: Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
TOM: Come on in.
TOM: I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
HELEN: What about him?
TOM: Helen, he's the man from the space ship! I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
HELEN: All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
TOM: How do you know?
HELEN: Never mind about that. You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
TOM: Are you crazy? After what happened today?
HELEN: You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
TOM: Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
HELEN: That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
TOM: He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
HELEN: But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
TOM: He told you... Don't be silly, honey -- just because you like the guy. You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
HELEN: Is that what you're thinking about?
TOM: Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
