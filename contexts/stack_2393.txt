Xbox one stream laptop I have a laptop with an hdmi port. I want to be able to switch over to that in the Xbox, but there is no \u201cTV\u201d app or anything to switch to the hdmi input. How can I do this? To clarify more i want to have my laptop display in the Xbox, not the Xbox display on the laptop
