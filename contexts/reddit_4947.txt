Depression: An Extremely Practical Guide to Making It Through Your Depressive Episode
Hey everyone! I made this guide awhile ago and posted it in /r/rbipolar and /r/depression. /r/depression removed it because their focus is not on solution-based content, but since I recently found this sub I thought I'd share it here as well. It by no means covers everything, but I'm hoping it will help some people here. 


Depression: An Extremely Practical Guide to Making It Through Your Depressive Episode 

So ages ago I came across an awesome guide to dealing with a depressive episode, which helped me immensely. I have been searching high and low for it to share, but I cannot for the life of me find it anywhere. If these tips ring a bell for anyone and they can get me the original to share, or you know the author, please let me know. 

In the meantime, here is my very practical guide to dealing with a depressive episode, based on what I pulled and use from that article as well as my own experience. 

[Note: I’m not a medical professional or a therapist or anything. These will not work for everyone. This is just a compiled list of things I have found useful, people I know have found useful, or I have read from other writers.]

Including: 
-The Very Basic Basics 
-Food 
-Personal Hygiene 
-Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross 
-Asking for Help 
-Summary of Lists to Prepare for Next Time 

**The Very Basic Basics**

1)Don’t Die 
It sort of goes without saying, but the end goal of dealing with a depressive episode is to make it through. So as long as you are still alive, good job! If you start thinking seriously about suicide, reach out and get help ASAP. Tell a trusted friend or family member, call a suicide hotline, or call emergency services (911 in America) or go to your nearest emergency room. 

2) Bare Minimums 
Moving forward from that, it's a good idea to lay out what the bare minimum for your day-in-the-life of a depressive episode. And I mean the absolute bare minimum. The more things you feel like you need to do, the harder it is to get up and do any of them, so make a very short list to start off. Once you are started on that list, often it's easier to continue with the momentum, but start small. 

For example, my list is:
Get out of bed at least once 
Take meds/vitamin 
Fill water bottle to drink throughout the day 
Eat at least one (1) thing
Do one “Have To” and one “Like To” (see next point) 

Theres plenty of other things I shoot to do, like showering and teeth brushing and eating more than just A Thing, but absolute worst come to worst, that's my very basic basics. 

3) Have To’s and Like To’s 
Try, everyday, to do one thing you have to do, and one thing you like to do. This is good because it shows you that, no matter how slowly you are moving, you are not stagnant. You are moving through this depressive episode. 

Make your Have To’s and Like To’s  proportional to your energy that day. On an okay day your Have To might be a load of laundry and your Like To might be a long walk. On a bad day your Have To might be wash one fork and your Like To might be to watch a funny youtube video. Baby steps. 

Don’t worry if you are not actually enjoying your Like To. Depression can kill your ability to enjoy anything, and that's okay, just do something you know you usually like. It will help you notice when you are starting to come out of the episode to see yourself begin to enjoy the things you usually do. 

At the end of the day, as long as you are alive and doing at least what you need to to keep that up, good job! 


**Food**

So in terms of food, the name of the game is to eat some. To do that when you barely have the energy to stand up or put on pants, you are going to want food that is as easy to make as possible. Also think about adding a multivitamin to your daily routine to help with the vitamin deficiencies your less-than-perfect depression diet probably has. 

[Note: I'm not a nutritionist. Note #2: I’m super white and all my examples are going to be pretty boring white-guy foods, because that's what I eat while depressed. Please take the general concepts listed here and modify to better foods if you can think of them]

Buy stuff in advance 
You probably don’t want to go shopping when you’re depressed. So sometime between episodes, stock up on things you can buy in advance and store until they are needed, like canned and frozen food. I’m not going to make a big list because it varies based on what you like, but whatever it is make sure it's food you at least enjoy regularly. Depression makes most things taste terrible, but if you like it usually it will be slightly easier to stomach. Bonus points for things with more than one major food group in one. Think things like:

Hearty soups/stews with protein and grains
Chef Boyardee or other kids pasta that contains a full veggie serving
Frozen Tv dinners that have a protein, veggie, and grain 
 
Whatever it is, you basically want stuff with instructions that read something along the lines of “Open, Microwave, Eat.” 

It’s also a good call to have some stuff in your cabinet that involve cooking, but that are easy and reheat well (see point 3). 

2) Grocery Shopping 
If your episodes are long, then at some point you are going to need to go buy some food (or ask a friend to get some for you, see: Asking For Help). There’s nothing worse than gathering all the energy to go to the grocery store, getting overwhelmed, and ending up coming home with just a box of cereal and a block of cheese, so again, prep a list before the episode hits. 

This is your chance to get the things that you can’t store in advance but that will still be easy to eat. Again, you want to get things that you like, and that require little to no effort to prepare. 

Stock your fridge with cold foods you can eat as they are. It depends on the things you like, but think along the lines of 
Yogurt 
Chicken or Tuna salad
Veggies you can eat raw (baby carrots are my fave) 
Hummus 
Cheese 
Sandwich meat 
Fruit (if you think you’ll eat it fast enough. Mine always ends up going bad) 
Milk (whole and soy have a bunch of protein) 
Pre-made sandwiches
Etc 

Also stock your pantry with easy to eat stuff like 
Bread (for sandwiches or toast with peanut butter or whatever) 
Crackers (for hummus/chicken or tuna salad/to put peanut butter on, or just to eat)
Cereal 
Snacks (See below) 

3) When you can cook, use that energy well 
If you have a day in a depressive episode when you have the energy to cook, or you have a friend over helping you, make sure you are ready to cook something that a) you like b) is still relatively easy to cook and c) you can make a bunch of and eat for awhile. 

As with the canned and frozen stuff, bonus points for things with multiple food groups all in one. Extra bonus points if it's something you can make in one pot/pan/dish. Think about these things in advance and have stuff on hand to cook. I always keep pasta (the hidden veggies kind!) and tomato sauce in my cupboard and some frozen ground turkey or beef for pasta with meat sauce. I know a lot of people who make great stir fry or curry with only a few ingredients that they can keep on hand. Whatever works for you. 

When I’m done cooking, I like leaving it all in one big tupperware, to have fewer things to clean (see: Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross) but I know other people prefer dividing it into meal-sized containers so they don’t have to worry about choosing serving sizes. 

4) Snacks! Make them useful 
Sometimes meals are tough. No worries, snacks are easier! But in choosing snacks, work towards ones that add up to the calorie and protein/vitamin content of a real meal. You are also probably going to eat some chocolate, which is totally cool, but think about adding something like 

Nuts/trail mix
Granola 
Protein/granola bars 
Beef Jerky
A giant spoonful of peanut butter (I know I’ve mentioned peanut butter a lot but it's so easy and good) 
Or other foods with similar benefits

5) Drinks 

DRINK WATER. As much as those “all you need to cure your depression is 8 glasses of water a day” posts are utter BS, water is extremely important and you need it to not die. Water bottles are easier to keep around than cups, so grab a water bottle you can keep on the couch/in your bed with you, and drink up. 

Whole milk and Soy milk both have a lot of protein per serving, and almond milk has a ton of vitamins. 

If you have a really hard time motivating yourself to eat, but there's a meal replacement/supplement you can drink, give it a go. Ensure or Carnation Instant Breakfast or something along those lines. If you find a protein powder that isn’t super gross, that's good too. Try not to rely too heavily on these, but they make a great addition to food. 

Drinks with a bunch of vitamins like v8 are a great addition as well. V8 also has a line of fruit and veggie drinks if you are like me and thing tomato juice itself is hella gross. 

Smoothies? I’m a big fan, but a whole blender can be a lot to clean for some people. I’m not talking crazy recipes with fresh kale and blueberries and 14 types of fish oil, but milk, a frozen banana, and chocolate chips is an easy, filling snack.

NO BOOZE. I know there's a temptation to drown sorrows in alcohol, but seriously it's a bad idea. Alcohol is a depressant on its own, and will probably make things worse. Also it will make you more dehydrated and whatnot. Just stay clear until you’re feeling better. 

And drink water. I said it before, but again, make sure you drink enough water. 


**Personal Hygiene**

OK so this one gets tricky, because I don’t want to be the one saying like, “meh, it's fine to bail on basic personal hygiene things” but when push comes to shove, if you can’t do 100%, it's good to have a compromise instead of doing 0%. So, a few points: 

1) Teeth:
If you only have the energy to brush once a day, make it right before bed.

Mouthwash is not as good as brushing your teeth, but it’s way easier, so in a pinch, grab some listerine, swish and spit. 

2) Showers 
Feeling gross will make you feel worse, so try to prioritize a shower of some  kind every other day or so, based on your energy level. 

You can compromise the amount of things you do in the shower to motivate yourself to get in. So instead of your 14-step shower routine with shampoo and conditioner and soap and that fancy exfoliating body wash, etc, tell yourself “I’m going to get in the shower, and I’m going to wash my armpits, and then I can just stare blankly at the floor until I run out of hot water.” Odds are, once you get in there and have the soap in hand, you’ll be able to keep the momentum going and wash the rest of you. If not, at least you don’t have stinky pits anymore, and that's cool too. 

Washing your hair is also a good thing, because it will overall make you feel less gross, but don’t let that become the tipping point that makes a shower too hard. Some people have found success with dry shampoo if that's easier. 

If you can’t manage a shower, have some baby wipes on hand that you can at least hit your pits with now and then. Again, these are awkward things to compromise on, but on your worst days anything is better than nothing. 

3) Face 
Baby wipes are also awesome for your face if you don’t have the energy to wash. 10/10 would recommend. 

4) Baby wipes in general 
Baby wipes are just in general great. Keep some in your bathroom for face/body washing, keep some by wherever you hole up when depressed (bed, couch, comfy chair) for wiping hands off after eating. Anything you need to be clean and you don’t have the energy to do in the traditional way, baby wipes can help. 

5) Have a routine 
If you have all your morning/evening bathroom stuff in a detailed routine usually, then it's easier to do it all on autopilot on your sort-of-okay depression days. Ie: always brush teeth first, then get in shower, wash hair first, then wash body, then wash face, then get out of shower, then dry off, then moisturize, etc. Autopilot is depressions friend, and also when your memory is iffy, it's easier to not have to think “Wait, did I brush my teeth before I got in the shower? Was that three days ago? Who knows.” 

5) Clothes 
Wearing the same sweatpants for 4 days in a row isn't great, but really not the end of the world, so don’t stress too much. Clean clothes can make you feel better though, so change when you have the energy. A good rule of thumb is to never put dirty clothes on a second time. If you have already taken an item of clothing off, as tempting as it is to just grab the same sweatpants off the floor after your shower, grab a fresh pair. You are already 75% of the way there. Grab clean underwear once a day when you go to the bathroom, and when you sit and your pants are down anyway, switch them out. 

If you start running out of clean clothes, laundry is usually pretty daunting, so thats a good time to pull in a favor from a friend (see: asking for help). 


Long story short, do as much as you can to keep clean, but don’t let being unable to keep up with your usual standards keep you from doing anything at all. Do what you can and consider anything you can manage a win.


**Keeping Your House Not Totally Gross**

The more gross your house is, the harder it seems to clean it and the more daunting that becomes. Also, embarrassment about a messy home can cause a lot of people to isolate because they don’t want people to come over, either just for company or to help. So, ideally, you want to keep a mess from getting too bad. So here’s some tips 

1) Trash
Don’t bother with trash cans. Ok hear me out on this one, trash cans are a nuisance. You’ve got to put a clean trash bag in, walk all the way over to the trash can to put stuff in, try not to overfill it, probably overfill it anyway, then have to really cram stuff in there to take the bag out, take the bag out, bring the bag to your dumpster/outdoor trash can, put a new bag in. That's way too much work. 
 
Instead, grab a bunch of plastic (or paper) grocery bags, and hang them on doorknobs around your home. Put one in the kitchen, the bedroom, the bathroom, living room, ect. Make sure you also have one near wherever you hole up when depressed (bed/couch/chair). Just toss your trash in there when you exit a room, and it keeps trash in much more manageable amounts. When it’s full you can just tie it off and pop a new one on. Or if someone is coming over and you have the energy to straighten up, just walk around and grab all the bags. Done! 

2) Dishes 
Ain’t nobody got time for dishes. Piles of dishes around your kitchen make it harder to eat, which makes it harder to have energy. Buy yourself some paper plates/bowls and plastic forks and spoons and use those for easy cleanup. Seriously, it's a life-saver. I recommend buying some on clearance after a holiday, because it's not like these are for impressing anyone, what do you care if you’re eating out of a halloween bowl in June? When you are done, pop those suckers in your nearby trash bag and you’re good to go. 

If any of your easy-cooking stuff involves roasting/baking, consider also grabbing some oven-safe baking tins that can be thrown out after a use or two. 


3) Disinfectant wipes
If your episodes are long enough that it’s unreasonable to not do any cleaning through the whole thing, disinfectant wipes are a great way to clean things super fast. Just grab a Clorox wipe or whatever and give your kitchen/bathroom countertops a quick wipedown. Make sure you have these on hand before the episode kicks in, so it's one less thing to grab on your trips out of the house. 

4) Overall 
Overall, try your best but don’t worry. Nobody expects you to be dusting and vacuuming your house when you have the flu, no one (including you) should expect that when you're in a depressive episode. 

If you are going to give cleaning up a go, but have limited energy, try committing 5 minutes to cleaning the space closest to wherever you hole up, usually a coffee table or night stand. If you are going to have one space clean, it might as well be the space you probably spend the most time staring at.

 Ask for help before it gets too bad. It's easy to fall into a trap where your house gets really bad, and it's overwhelming to clean, but it's also so messy that you are embarrassed to have someone over, even a friend to help with the mess, which just exacerbates the problem. If it's getting pretty bad, but not embarrassingly bad yet, thats a good time to call a friend (see: getting help). Or even if it is embarrassingly bad, still ask for help. Again, you’re sick, it's okay to be a mess. 

**Asking for Help**

A strong support system is your best way to get through an episode. Having people you can rely on, emotionally and practically, can go a huge way towards helping you through the episode. 

1) Again, Don’t Die 
I’m going to say it again, above all else you want to make it through the episode. If you are seriously thinking of hurting yourself in any way, or are having thoughts of suicide, reach out IMMEDIATELY and get help by telling a trusted friend or family member, calling a suicide hotline, calling emergency services (911 in america) or going to your nearest ER. 

2) Explain your depression before an episode
Talk to the people who care about you about the fact that you have depression, and what a depressive episode looks like for you. If they give you the “yeah, okay, I get sad sometimes too” face, you might need to do some work to get them to understand how bad it can be and why you might need their help. If they give you the “Oh sh*t, that sucks so much for you that you have depression, I get that because I understand how bad depression can be” face, then they are a good person to ask for help. 

3) Ask for explicit, practical help from friends and family 

When you say you’re having an episode, a lot of people will say “aw, well let me know if there's anything I can do to help.” They say this because most people want to, but have no frigging clue how to help you. And it's true they can’t make you not depressed anymore, but they can help in practical ways. 

When you come across a task that needs to be done, but that you don’t have the energy for, its a good time to call a friend. They will likely be happy that they get to help you, because they love you and want to, and they will be happy to not have to worry or guess how to best do so. 

So ask for specific things. When they say “Is there anything I can do to help?” Say something like:

“Yeah, actually. I know it's kind of weird to ask, but my laundry is piling up and I need a hand with it. Any chance you could come over and help? We can watch a movie while it's in the washer.”
“Yeah, I really need to do dishes but I’m having a hard time motivating myself. Can you come over and give me a hand? I think I would do better at it with company.”
“Yeah, somehow being unable to get out of bed for 3 days has made my apartment gross and I don’t know where to start. Can you help?”
“Hey, I really need some food, but I’m having a hard time getting to the store. If I gave you a list, could you pick some things up for me? I’ll pay you back for them.” 

Its weirdly personal to ask for help with this sort of stuff, but your loved ones who say they are there to help are actually there to help, you just need to tell them how. 

Also, of course, use your own language when asking for help. Mine is a lot less formal and a lot more “Hey, one of you nerds should bring my depressed ass some chinese food.” But whatever works for you and your support system. 

4) Be specific in what you need socially 
In the same way you need practical needs met, it will also be helpful to you and your loved ones if you are explicit with what you need from them socially. 
. 
This is going to depend dramatically on how being around other people affects your depression. A lot of us tend towards isolation, and for some that's effective, but for others it helps more to be in the company of others. It’s okay to not be yourself or be the life of the party, so if you want company, say so. Again, be specific. You can ask a friend: 

“Hey, I need some company, but I don’t have energy to go anywhere or do anything. Want to come over and watch a movie while I lay on my couch?” 

Or, if it would be good to get out of the house, but you don’t have much energy, same thing:

“Hey, I still have way too much depression for doing things, but I need a change of scenery. Can I come lay on your couch while you do stuff?” 

If a group of friends invite you out to do something, and you’d like to even though you will be a wet blanket, tell them that. If you warn them, then you won't feel bad about not being yourself. You can say:

“I’d love to join, but I’m still dealing with a depressive episode, so I will probably just sit there. That okay?”

Or if a group of friends are going out/one friend wants to hang out, and you don’t want to, it can be good to let them know if they should keep inviting you places. Say something like 

I think my depression is still acting up too much to come out tonight. Thanks for inviting me, though. I appreciate knowing you still want me around, so please keep asking me even if I keep saying no. Eventually I’ll be able to say yes again. 
Or
I’m probably going to be too depressed to go out for a little while. I feel really bad that I have to keep saying no, so how about I tell you when I’m feeling better and we can start hanging out again. 

However BE CAREFUL when creating long-term distance from people. You need some people checking in on you, so it’s okay to isolate from acquaintances and casual friends who you don’t have the energy for, but make sure to have some close friends around.

5) Talking to casual acquaintances 
It's tricky to explain depression to people who don’t understand, so in the middle of an episode it takes a lot of unnecessary effort to explain it to casual acquaintances. People like coworkers, friends-of-friends, distant relatives you don’t like, etc aren’t owed that level of information about you if you don’t want to get into it. That is not to say depression is anything shameful or something you should hide. A lot of people feel empowered by being open about it, but personally I just find it inconvenient with that level of acquaintance. 

Everyone has their own tactic for explaining whats going on, so use whatever works for you. It's a good thing to think about in advance, so you are not suddenly caught off guard by a coworker asking why you’ve been so off lately. Whatever it is you want to say, know in advance how much and what you’d like to share. 

Since mental illnesses are illnesses, it's totally fair to refer to an episode as “being sick.” The conversation I use most frequently goes as follows.
 
You okay? You’ve seemed off lately.
Yeah, I’ve been sick. I’ll be fine. 
Oh no, do you have that [cold/stomach bug/allergies] that has been going around?
No, its part of like, a whole thing *gestures vaguely to all of me* It happens sometimes, but I’ll be okay. 
Oh okay, well I hope you feel better. 

That establishes that 1) yes, something is going on but 2) I clearly don't want to talk about it. 3) I’ll be fine so don't worry and 4) leave me alone. 

I use a variation of that explanation for calling out of work, canceling plans with acquaintances, explaining why I’m not super peppy at work, etc. 

Again, use whatever language and level of sharing you feel comfortable with, just think about it in advance. 

6)Getting professional help 
If you are at the point where a guide like this is necessary, you probably also need help from a pro. Nothing to be ashamed of; no one would expect you to beat cancer without the help of a doctor, no one should expect you to handle depression alone either. 

I'm not going to go into detail about how to find a doc, since it differs dramatically based on your insurance/money/location, but its important. Getting to a doc is a good task to call in a favor from a friend if you need. You might have friends saying "you should really talk to a doctor about this." Tell them "yes, I want to, but I do not have the energy to make that happen. Here is the log-in to my insurance's website, can you find a doctor for me and stand here while I call and schedule an appointment?" if you have to. 

I'm also not going to make any claims on how to treat your depression in terms of medication, talk therapy, diet, etc, but I will say this: Talk to your doctor and seriously consider any and all recommendations they offer, including medication. 


Summary of Lists to Prepare for Next Time
 Phew! Okay, that’s the guide. So to summarize the things you should prep before an episode:

Lists to make:
Your list of absolute bare minimums for every day 
Depression grocery shopping list of foods that are easy but can’t be purchased in advance

Things to have:
Good canned/frozen foods in your pantry/freezer that require no prep
Storable food items that need to be cooked, but are easy
Storable healthy snacks
Mouthwash, baby wipes, and dry shampoo if you’re into that 
Plastic/paper bags for trash 
Paper plates, bowls, and cups
Waterproof box with a lid for dishes 
Disinfectant wipes for cleaning 

People to talk to/things to think about
Talk to people in your support system to see who understands depression; educate those who do not 
Explain the type of help you might need
Think about what level of detail you want to share with various people so you are prepared for when they ask 

Please add any useful tips i missed in the comments, and again, if anyone can find the original guide that a lot of these came from, please lmk/post it in the comments. 

Hope this helps! Stay safe friends!
