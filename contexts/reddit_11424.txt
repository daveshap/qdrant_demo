Can't make friends
Everyone in my school, hometown and probably a lot of the people (kids and teens) in my country are not stupid per se, rather unwanting to think. I'm very different. And to make it even worse, I cannot simply talk to people (can't even fake smile) and I don't know why. Almost all of my friends go to a very different school and I talk to them maybe once per month at best. The only friend I have still left near me is starting to mock me for everything I say, do or even own (like clothes that aren't designer or something). And my school friends are the same as the rest. All of them smoke, listen to their stupid brainless music (german rap, it has nothing to say and contains mostly swears that make all of them think thats edgy and cool) and are just these stereotypical 14 year old "depressed" kids.

My point is, I can't make friends because people find me awkard for not being able to talk to them properly and because I don't like the people in my hometown because of reasons stated earlier. I am a very "nice" person and I couldn't tell someone in the face that something is bothering me because they might think that I think I'm better than them. But they think otherwise. Point stuff out that makes you uncomfortable and insult you as they please. I don't know where to look for people without going on a drive. I just don't know what to do.
