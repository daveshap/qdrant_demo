What are the rules of engagement for US police dealing with protesters and journalists, and how are they enforced?
As [protests continue across the US](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/minneapolis-george-floyd-protest-may31-1.5592200) following the video-recorded death of George Floyd in a neck restraint by a police officer, there is controversy about the use of force by police responding to both violent and peaceful protests. US civil-rights groups have [criticized](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/aggressive-policing-tactics-called-question-national-protests-flare-n1220471) the degree of force used to disperse protesters, which Amnesty International calls ["militarized"](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/usa-police-must-end-excessive-militarised-response-george-floyd-protests), while [news companies](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/05/31/george-floyd-protests-stop-attacking-journalists-we-have-job-do/5300346002/) and [press-freedom groups](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-protests-press-idUSKBN2370T5) have expressed concern about "targeted attacks" by police against journalists reporting on the protests. On the other hand, after [police SUVs drove into a crowd of protesters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-york-mayor-bill-de-blasio-defends-police-after-video-n1220246) in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio defended the officers and blamed the protesters for surrounding the vehicles and threatening them, and Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said in a [public statement to NYPD members](https://twitter.com/NYPDShea/status/1267074838436425729) that he is "extremely proud" of the way they have responded to the situation. President Donald Trump and Attorney General Bill Barr [urged](https://apnews.com/b3817623ef861818803b5676d43741ea) governors to increase the use of force.

What kinds of policies and regulations govern how the police may respond to protests? Who sets them and who enforces them? How does the appropriate degree of force depend on the degree to which protesters are violent, damaging private property, or armed with deadly weapons? And are there specific rules about how police should subdue and disperse journalists as opposed to protesters?
