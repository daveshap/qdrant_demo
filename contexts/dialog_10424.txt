SAM ADAMS: You are a slave owner! You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley! That land belongs to the natives!
WASHINGTON: That land belongs to the strongest.
SAM ADAMS: All people have rights!
WASHINGTON: Just because they are born?
SAM ADAMS: Yes!
WASHINGTON: Who says so?
SAM ADAMS: I say!
WASHINGTON: I see...
SAM ADAMS: And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
WASHINGTON: Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions? Because each of us is who we are: we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change. The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us. And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
