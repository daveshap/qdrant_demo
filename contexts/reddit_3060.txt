I was fired, but don’t know what I’m supposed to learn from this experience or what to say in interviews?
I worked in a nonprofit in a marketing and communications role. I study graphic design on the side and used those skills for my job. They never had anyone do this before so it really enhanced the work. I asked during my 6 month review if I could use the material I designed for my portfolio, and my manager said yes.

However, a year later, she found the material I designed for the company on my personal website and I got fired because of this for going against a related policy. 

However, the real reason is because I was unhappy there and my boss and I didn’t have a good relationship as I felt she was very autocratic and was not open to change or my input. There was many times she would
dismiss my ideas. There was a few times we had conflict/tension which is why I believe I was let go. Actually, a week before I was fired, I voiced my concern to hear about not feeling I have any input or that my opinion was valued, and a week later, she fired me. HR also told me in the termination meeting that I outgrew the role. 

In the end, I learned what kind of work place culture and management style I like (trust, autonomy, growth and not distrust or micromanagement), but how do I explain this in interviews since they you should never bad mouth your former employer and what do I tell them about why I was fired?


Really struggling about this. 
I have an interview today.
