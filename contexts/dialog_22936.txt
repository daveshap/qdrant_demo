JIM: Did he ever get rough with you?
DIANE: Dad, no. But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
COREY: Did you sleep with her?
LLOYD: I admit nothing.
DC: Lloyd, it's us.
COREY: Look at his face, he did the deed.
DC: You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
LLOYD: Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
COREY: Lloyd, listen to me. EVERYTHING has changed. You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two. You might be sixty. You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
LLOYD: So, what's your point?
COREY: You've got to do something special. You've got to make a statement.
DC: Wait a minute.
COREY: You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
DC: Wait a minute.
COREY: And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
DC: You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
COREY: What? I'm sorry, talk.
DC: I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
LLOYD: Alright.
COREY: Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter. Something.
LLOYD: I already did.
COREY: What does it say?
LLOYD: Read it.
COREY: Dear Diane
DC: I dream about it.
