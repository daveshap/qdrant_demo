WILSON: Had a feeling it was you.
ELAINE: You look alike.
WILSON: Perhaps it was the smoke.
ELAINE: Not her brand.
WILSON: She used to pinch 'em off me. Funny that. One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
ELAINE: Why did you come here?
WILSON: Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
ELAINE: No, why did you come here?
WILSON: Sort a few things out.
ELAINE: Been busy, have you.
WILSON: How d'you mean?
ELAINE: It's been a while.
WILSON: I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
ELAINE: That's not what I heard.
WILSON: What was that, then?
ELAINE: I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- at Her Majesty's pleasure.""
WILSON: It was the bars, then.
ELAINE: In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
WILSON: Sewing mailbags? Me? Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
ELAINE: And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out. From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it? Pink Floyd concert receipts. Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
WILSON: Hardly buried. Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
ELAINE: Well, that kind of security can't be bought. Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
WILSON: Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
ELAINE: Try calling me again.
