BURKE: Those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division. Now, if you're smart we can both come out of this heroes. Set up for life.
RIPLEY: You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
BURKE: You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.

RIPLEY: You sent them to that ship. I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
RIPLEY: You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
BURKE: Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right? And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in. Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
