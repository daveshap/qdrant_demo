Inline Voltage Divider - do they exist? I'm looking for a neat off the shelf solution to halving a voltage via a resistor network. Some kind of small module, (probably GND, signal in, signal out) that can be wired inline with a sensor that delivers 0-10V for feeding into a 0-5V ADC.I do NOT want to make my own PCB, enclosure etc. This should be something that can be dropped straight into production equipment.I have tried googling the title desription but nothing comes up. Do such devices exist, and if so what are they called?Thanks for the replies - the term I am looking for is \"precision attenuator\"
