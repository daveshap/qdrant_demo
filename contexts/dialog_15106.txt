LEX: I'm a hacker!
TIM: That's what I said! You're a nerd! They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
TIM: Hey Lex, ahhhchooo! Hey Lex, com here.
LEX: What?
TIM: Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
GRANT: You know what this is? It's a dinosaur egg. The dinosaurs are breeding.
TIM: But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
GRANT: Amphibian DNA.
LEX: What's that?
GRANT: Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps. They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs. Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment. Malcolm was right! Look, life found a way!
ARNOLD: No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
ELLIE: Wait a minute. What exactly does this mean?
HAMMOND: We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us. We will never find the command NEDRY used. He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back. So shutting down the system - -
ARNOLD: I will not do it. You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
HAMMOND: - - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
ARNOLD: Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system. It may not come back at all.
ELLIE: But would we get the phones back?
ARNOLD: Yeah, again, in theory, but - -
MULDOON: What about the lysine contingency? We could put that into effect!
ELLIE: What's that?
