All of you with posts that start with "mom/dad wants me to..." - please listen
When it comes to your relatives then words such as 'sign, loan, use credit' are words that you want to avoid. See it this way, words are actions in a way and with action comes consequences.  

On this sub there are countless stories about sons and daugthers who got screwed over by their mom and dad bc mom and dad just wanted to borrow a bit of money, just this once and of course they will pay their sons and daughters back. But history tells us that mom and dad are incapable of handling money. They have student loans from 40 years ago, and they dont own their house even though they had 30-40 years to pay for it. 

Always see the big picture when it comes to your parents. And ask yourself "if the bank won't let mom and dad take a loan, then why should I?" "If they can't sign, then why should I"

You are not the guardian of your mom and dad. 

You are not responsible for your mom and dad. 

You have the right and I would almost say obligation to say NO. 

Just say no. You have your own life to live and your own financials to take care of. Not their financials. 

When you say no, they will be angry with you but you have to look out for yourself and build your life on solid financial foundation.
