BRIAN: Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
SHADOW: Your Dennis' kid. I work alone.
SHADOW: Are you still here?
BRIAN: Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
SHADOW: Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
BRIAN: I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
SHADOW: Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer. You think you're the first?
BRIAN: Where are you going?
SHADOW: Pest control.
RONALD: Shadow.
SHADOW: How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
RONALD: Didn't think you'd make it.
SHADOW: Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
RONALD: Who's this?
SHADOW: He works for me.
RONALD: Is he a fireman? I like firemen.
SHADOW: You like everybody, Ronald.
RONALD: Brian McCaffrey... Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
BRIAN: Hey, do I know you?
SHADOW: You don't know him.
RONALD: I know you.
