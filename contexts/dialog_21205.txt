BRANDON: This is it, Betty. They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
BETTY: If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself? Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick. When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either. It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time. The water is cold down there-- But so is everything else. And there's you.
BRANDON: Me?
BETTY: Yes. You. You're not really a murderer yet.
