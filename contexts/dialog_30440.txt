RAMONA: How do you feel?
VIRIDIANA: I have a headache.
RAMONA: That will soon pass. It's nothing.
VIRIDIANA: What happened to me?
RAMONA: You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
VIRIDIANA: Have I slept long?
RAMONA: Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
DON JAIME: Leave us alone, Ramona.
VIRIDIANA: Don't go!
