FERRARI: I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
LASZLO: Yes, something.
FERRARI: Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
LASZLO: Do you know where they are?
FERRARI: Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
LASZLO: Rick?
FERRARI: He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
LASZLO: Thank you very much. Good day.
