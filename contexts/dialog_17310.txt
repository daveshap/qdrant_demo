MORPHEUS: Listen to me, Neo. I know why you're afraid to go through that door. You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong. You must believe me. There is a greatness inside of you, Neo. A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
NEO: Morpheus, I don't know --
MORPHEUS: I know. That is why it is so important for you to go. Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
