Being alive is so weird.
About 2 days ago I felt like killing myself and it's all I could think about. But I didn't know what to do, I worked on my appearance in the meantime. Complaining the whole time in my mind that I'm not pretty and it doesn't matter what I do I'll never look good enough. I made my hair so soft and silky and straight and it still made me sad. Then I continued and did my makeup something I haven't done in years and still I felt stupid. After all that I was still alive and went to work and had a good day. I still dont really know what I want but somehow just doing my hair and makeup was enough of a distraction to keep me alive. I hate this but I guess it's okay. I still feel kind of hopeless and lost it's kind of crazy how we can find distractions from ourselves.
