Why are there current and voltage limits in a DC bench power supply? I have a few questions about bench power supplies.Why does a DC PSU have a low output voltage limit, usually in the range of 18V-24V?Why is there a current limit built into the PSU? My understanding is that the PSU should only supply voltage (i.e. energy to the electrons in the circuit wires) and the supplied current should only depend on the resistance of the wire or the internal resistance of supply or component attached, i.e. a resistor or LED?When we short the terminals of the power supply, why does the output voltage on the supply approach zero? If there is no component attached, shouldn't there be zero voltage drop across the terminals, leaving the output voltage the same as if the output was not shorted?
