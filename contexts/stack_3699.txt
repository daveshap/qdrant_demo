An example of a bivariate pdf, where marginals are triangular distributions What could be a form of $$f_{X,Y}(x,y)$$where $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(x)$ both have the form of a triangular distribution with support $(0,1)$, but with different parameters that governs location of mode?Some discussion on it could be found in Eagleson, G.K., Lancaster, H.O.: The regression system of sums with random elements in common.
