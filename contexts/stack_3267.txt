Story ID for dark urban fantasy novel from late 1990s I read a fantasy novel in the 1998 or 1999 that I'm trying to identify. The most specific thing I remember was a scene where the main character was sneaking through a building and he saw a naked armless troll writhing around on the floor and there was a very specific description of the troll's penis as being worn raw. Pretty gross, but that's why it stuck with me.The book was in English and was probably American. It was a dark urban fantasy novel with lots of explicit sex and violence, probably over the top to the point of cheesiness. It had all the standard fantasy creature like elves and trolls and I'm pretty sure it was set in a fantasy world not in a variant of our world. I can't confirm when it was written, but it was on the new books shelf at my library so it was likely written in the late 90s. I don't recall the cover image as the book didn't have a jacket. I'm pretty sure it was hardcover.I don't think it was written by a major fantasy author like Michael Moorcock or Terry Brooks, as I was reading those authors and probably would have remembered. I also don't think it was explicitly part of a series of books, but it could have been the first book in something that became a series. It also wasn't part of a some larger franchise, like a Dungeons and Dragons or Magic: The Gathering novel.I wish I remembered more, but that one scene was all that really stuck with me.
