Pregnancy.
My girlfriend was on the pill for a few months in order to regulate her periods. She stopped taking them the last week of May. She got her period the last week of June. We fooled around in the shower around July 5, however I didn’t not go inside of her. I am worried about ‘pre-cum’ and that issue. She is 2 days late (usually stars the 25 and it’s the 27) she also says she feels weird. Please give any clarifications and advice, thank you.
