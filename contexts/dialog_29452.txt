MARQUEZ: That's good coke.
HELENA: It should be... It's yours. I want our debt forgiven. I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States. And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
MARQUEZ: Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
MARQUEZ: Take this back with you. Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
HELENA: That's crazy. My husband is on trial for smuggling.
MARQUEZ: Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government.
HELENA: You will help me with my other problem.
MARQUEZ: Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego. And we have a deal.
