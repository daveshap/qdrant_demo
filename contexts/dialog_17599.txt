ROPER: What do you got on Korda?
KIMURA: We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
ROPER: Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
KIMURA: Being faxed over now.
ROPER: How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
KIMURA: Roper...
ROPER: And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
KIMURA: Roper, we're into it...
