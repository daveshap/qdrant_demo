SALESMAN: October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
JULIET: That sounds fine.
SALESMAN: Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
JULIET: What?
SALESMAN: Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
JULIET: Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
SALESMAN: It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot is variable.
JULIET: The first one was fine.
SALESMAN: Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
ALEX: No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
JULIET: It's the only way.
ALEX: I refuse.
JULIET: You're frightened.
ALEX: No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
MCCALL: Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
DAVID: What about?
MCCALL: It's about the burglary.
DAVID: Burglary?
MCCALL: Downstairs.
DAVID: Of course.
MCCALL: Can we come in?
DAVID: So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
MCCALL: did you hear anything before he cries?
DAVID: No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
MCCALL: Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
DAVID: No, nothing, sorry.
MCCALL: Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
DAVID: Of course.
MCCALL: And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
DAVID: There are only two other people in the flat.
MCCALL: Two?
DAVID: Who said there were four?
MCCALL: We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
DAVID: No, three. Who said there were four?
MCCALL: How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
DAVID: Yes, absolutely.
MCCALL: Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
MITCHELL: Both, sir.
MCCALL: Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
DAVID: I see.
MCCALL: I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
DAVID: No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
MCCALL: Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
DAVID: I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
MCCALL: Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
DAVID: Someone lost the key.
MCCALL: Is this where no one stays?
DAVID: Yeah, that's right, that's it.
ALEX: You'll wait in the hall?
JULIET: I'll wait there.
ALEX: And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
JULIET: Everything.
ALEX: Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
JULIET: Alex.
ALEX: What?
JULIET: As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
