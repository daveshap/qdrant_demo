BOB: So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
MARTIN: Fine, Bob. How are you?
BOB: Never better.
MARTIN: Really?
BOB: Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
MARTIN: You could've been a contender, huh?
