Is there any way to play Diablo III in English? I have bought a digital version of Diablo III at xbox.com at a South America sale.My Xbox One region is USA and the language is English. But still when I download the game it only has the Spanish Language.I can't find a way to play it in English or even buy it again at its North America version this time!Does anyone have any idea on how I can solve this?Thank you.
