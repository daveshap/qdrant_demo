Benefits of doing psychology grad school right after undergrad?
I’m about to finish undergrad with a psychology degree, and want to work in an “unrelated” area for a year or two to take a break from school and also to make some money. Is this a bad idea if my end goal is to make it to grad school in psychology? What was your journey?
