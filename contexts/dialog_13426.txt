HOLLAND: All that you say comes down to the same thing. You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
DR. MAXWELL: Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
HOLLAND: You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
BETSY: I've worked with it. I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
DR. MAXWELL: It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland. The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor. The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
HOLLAND: I don't know -- I don't know--
DR. MAXWELL: It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
HOLLAND: Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make? Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!
