I actually told someone I wasn't feeling it instead of ghosting!
Met this girl off of bumble and we talked for a while. She's in law school and works a part time job so she doesn't have a lot of time. She also wanted a serious relationship and right away I knew I couldn't do that because I like having a lot of time with whoever I'd be in a long term relationship with. 

I still talked to her just to get to know her and the more we chatted the more I realized she wasn't right for me but she wanted to plan a date. Normally in these situations I would just ghost because it's easier than having to let someone down but I decided to let her know I didn't see it working out. She hasn't replied back but I feel so much better actually saying how I felt rather than ghosting and leaving her to wonder where it went wrong.
