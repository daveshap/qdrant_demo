HENRY: We were just lost, okay? And we went down this curvy staircase. At the bottom was a big shadow.
LARRY: Big as a house.
HENRY: Not that big.
LARRY: Well almost. Depends which house. It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
LARRY: And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
HENRY: Like this.
LARRY: It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
HENRY: They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
LARRY: They were yellow!
HENRY: You're color blind.
