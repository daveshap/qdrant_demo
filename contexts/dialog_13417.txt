BETSY: Does she suffer?
DR. MAXWELL: I don't know. I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
BETSY: She can never be cured?
DR. MAXWELL: I've never heard of a cure.
BETSY: Is this disease common in the tropics?
DR. MAXWELL: Fortunately, not. This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies. I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
