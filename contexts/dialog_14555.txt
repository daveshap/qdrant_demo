BRODY: You stay here a minute.
MIKE: Oh, c'mon.
BRODY: You heard me.
JACKIE: We'll be over by the lighthouse.
MIKE: I'll be right there. Wait up.
ELKINS: Could be a shark. But maybe not.
BRODY: Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
ELKINS: Do you?
BRODY: I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan....
ELKINS: Carcharadon Carcharias.
BRODY: That's it.
ELKINS: Okay, so that's it.
BRODY: Is there one in these waters?
ELKINS: What makes you think there might be?
BRODY: Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
ELKINS: This is a mammal, not a fish.
BRODY: Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
ELKINS: Probably.
BRODY: That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
ELKINS: And sound.
BRODY: Sound?
ELKINS: Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
BRODY: So there's one around here.
ELKINS: Not necessarily. These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately fatal. Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
HENDRICKS: We got a helluva tide this month.
BRODY: Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
MIKE: Pop....
BRODY: You stay right here. You're going in with me.
