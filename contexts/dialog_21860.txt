JEFF: Where?
GUNNISON: Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
JEFF: Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
GUNNISON: You did.
JEFF: Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
GUNNISON: With that cast on -- you don't.
JEFF: Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
GUNNISON: You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
JEFF: Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
GUNNISON: I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
JEFF: You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
GUNNISON: So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
JEFF: You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
