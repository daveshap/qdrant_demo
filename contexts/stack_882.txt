Kubuntu: Show programs only on their workspace When switching workspaces (Virtual Desktops); is there a way to make programs only show up on their belonging workspace? By default all programs are visible on the taskbar, even if the program is on a different workspace. If you click the program, it will take you to the workspace it belongs to. I do not want any programs showing up that does not belong to the current workspace I am on.Help will be very much appreciated.I am running on Ubuntu 18.04, with the Kubuntu Desktop.
