MASON: 
MASON: Been trying to figure out your secret.
LONG: My secret?
MASON: Yeah. Ten months we've been fishin' this river together. We use the same equipment, more or less...
MASON: ...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
MASON: And I'm good at this. Been doing it since I was a kid. But you, I don't know. Somehow you think...
MASON: ...like a fish.
LONG: No, that's not possible, Mason. The trout...
LONG: ...is a perfect hunter.
LONG: He's brains without ambition...
LONG: ...sensitivity without neurosis. He's...
LONG: ...the master of his realm.
LONG: How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
LONG: There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
LONG: Turn the power of the hunter against him.
LONG: Tie a fly...
LONG: ...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
LONG: ...forcing him to strike. And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
LONG: ...back...
LONG: ...and that power...
LONG: ...without caution...
LONG: ...is death.
MASON: Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
MASON: ...-to a simple thing like...
MASON: ...fishin'.
LONG: Some people might.
