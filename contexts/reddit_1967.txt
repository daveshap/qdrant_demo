An analysis of 3,069 college emails
I once read a post on /r/A2C nearly one year ago from /u/Popopopper123 titled "A brief analysis of 2374 college emails" which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/aibmii/a_brief_analysis_of_2374_college_emails/), and I knew when reading that I would want to conduct some analysis of my own.

One year later, I finally committed to a university, ~~I'm procrastinating studying for my AP exams~~, and I'm excited to take a look at the schools that have been harassing me for the past 4 years.

**Disclaimers:**

* These numbers may actually be underestimated. In the fall, I created a new email address that I thought was more professional than my last. I set up my old inbox to forward every email I received to the new email inbox, but there possibly were emails that got caught in the spam filter of my first email that I could not get access to.
* I'm not sure of the legality of this, but my high school gives assignments that are basically filling out forms with your information, and this information is then sold to colleges. I was forced to give out my information probably 5 times.
* I took the PSAT 3 times, SAT 3 times, and ACT 2 times, and never once did I opt out of the Student Search Service.
* I don't believe I deleted any emails, and I usually added them to a folder that was specifically for college mail. I don't believe I unsubscribed either, but I may have gotten annoyed once or twice and done it a couple times.
* I only ever personally requested information from two colleges: the University of Florida and the University of Pennsylvania.
* I made sure not to include any emails of the 14 colleges I applied to after I submitted my application so as not to skew their numbers.
* I counted these numbers by searching each college's name and recording them in an excel sheet, and I am prone to error.

One thing that I think would be very cool would be to make a cumulative bar chart over time like the ones currently popular over on /r/dataisbeautiful but that would require some coding and is way out of my expertise.

Uh I think that's it. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Let me know if you are curious about something else in the comments and I can try my best to give an answer.
