Some people are trash at communication
I’m a really straightforward and upfront person. If I like you, I’ll let you know and offer my number. If I’m no longer interested in dating you I’ll tell you so. 

There’s this guy I met a few months back that I’d see almost daily. We’d chat and we got to know each other. I thought “hey I like this guy” so I asked him if I could give him my number. He said yes. We texted for a bit and then a few days later he stops texting me and I don’t see him around. Over a week and a half later he pops up out of nowhere and sends me a text. 

Also this past Friday I was supposed to go on a date with some other guy and he didn’t follow through because “he got distracted by his friends”. I told him it was okay and that if he doesn’t want to go on a date that it is fine but also tell me what you want. I got no response.

I know these are minor things and it’s not a big issue. It’s just frustrating when I hear all the time that guys appreciate an upfront girl but whenever I’m upfront with guys I feel like I scare them away. 

I talked to a friend about this and he said it might be because I’m intimidating, but I’m a tiny gal. I feel like I don’t look that intimidating.  

Not sure where I’m going with this post, I’m just frustrated about getting stuck dealing with people that can’t communicate.
