Do not mistake good costumer service with flirting.
Hello everyone! 

I have seen multiple post where someone asks if they should ask a certain worker out beacuse they felt a connection, they were being nice, charming, ect. As a female who has worked at a theme park I have had men ask me out daily as I’m sure a lot of other females can relate to. It comes off as incredibly creepy and can often times make us feel uncomfortable. It’s sad how to most people this isn’t obvious and the reason why I felt compelled to make this post. Of course asking someone out doesn’t hurt anyone but please don’t take me being nice to you as flirting especially when I am working and this is my job.

Edit - Thank you for all the amazing people who are sharing their stories :) I am astonished at the amount of sexism in the comments. This should be common knowledge. It is honestly shameful how some people are being and it’s a sign that things need to change. When we smile at you we aren’t flirting, we are at our jobs to earn money. We as customer service workers absolutely have the right to feel safe. The fact the we could risk our jobs by telling a delusional creep to fuck off is absolutely unacceptable. It’s sad that I am not surprised by the response from a majority of the men. Thank you to all the people who understand the point of view of the worker.
