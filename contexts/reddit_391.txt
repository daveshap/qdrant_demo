Help for moving to a new school??
I’m 16 and a girl. I go to a school in Chicago suburbs w about 3,200 students. Usually I’m pretty outgoing but I have pretty bad anxiety. Next year, I’m moving to Minneapolis and I’m going to a smaller high school there. I’m shadowing there in a few weeks, any tips or advice? I’m really scared that I’ll make a bad impression or people won’t like me.
