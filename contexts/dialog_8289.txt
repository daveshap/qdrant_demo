OFFICER: Good morning!
ALMÁSY: Could I trouble you for some water?
OFFICER: Yes, of course. So, golly, where have you come from?
ALMÁSY: I desperately need a jeep. There's been an accident.
OFFICER: I see.
ALMÁSY: No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle? I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and… Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
OFFICER: Do you have your papers, sir?
ALMÁSY: What?
OFFICER: If I could just see some identification.
ALMÁSY: Am I not talking sense? - forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers. I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
OFFICER: Right. And what's your name, sir?
ALMÁSY: Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down. A glance at his Corporal.
OFFICER: Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me? What nationality would that be?
ALMÁSY: Look, listen to me. A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here. I have been walking for three days! I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
OFFICER: I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
ALMÁSY: No! NO! Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
ALMÁSY: Hey! Hey! Stop this jeep! Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
CORPORAL: Shut-up!
ALMÁSY: Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me. My wife is dying.
CORPORAL: Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
ALMÁSY: Fritz? What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
CORPORAL: That's your name innit? Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
