I feel pressured to lie about my employment gap. What should I be saying?
I’ve been unemployed since July. I didn’t quit for school - rather, I was let go from my corporate position in April and did temp work through July.

Since then, I’ve re-entered graduate school in a field I was more interested in.  I did so because I had been struggling with finding a permanent, full-time position with my experience since April, and I figured I could transition to a career I really wanted.

I’m currently in my second semester. I have had atrocious luck finding work, because retail managers know based on my resume that the work is temporary for me, but appropriate positions (temp and full-time) haven’t been pulling through.

Fast forward to this Thursday. I’ve been working with a recruiter, and she’s been extremely helpful (rare, I know). I interviewed at a place that was the best fit I’ve ever had, based on their culture, location, compensation, and growth opportunities.

The first person I spoke to, my would-be manager, loved me. The second person also seemed to really like me, but he asked me what I’ve been doing since July. I told him I was in graduate school. He didn’t seem to recoil at all, but Friday I heard from the recruiter that they really liked me, but they were afraid that I wasn’t looking to work “in a permanent position” because of school. I’ll have to wait until Monday to hear the results.

The thing is, I didn’t feel comfortable saying, “oh there’s a gap here because nobody wants me” eloquently. And so it feels like I’m being punished for being unemployed *and* for filling up my free time with something.

I’m going to stick to my story here. It’s the truth after all. But what else can I say to future employers? Why is a situation like mine a red flag anyway? I’m just trying to get my career back on track.
