TAXI DRIVER: Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
JENNIE: What?
TAXI DRIVER: Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
JENNIE: No. I'm OK. Thanks.
TAXI DRIVER: You're OK?
JENNIE: Yeah.
TAXI DRIVER: Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
JENNIE: Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
TAXI DRIVER: A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
JENNIE: Sorry.
TAXI DRIVER: Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
