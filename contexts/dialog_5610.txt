REGGIE: Peter -- are you all right?
PETER: I think I sprained my pride. Where'd he go?
REGGIE: Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
PETER: Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
REGGIE: Be careful, Peter.
PETER: You took the words right out of my mouth.
