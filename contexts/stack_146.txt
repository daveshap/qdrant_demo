Install Windows 10 or 8.1 on MacBook 4,1 I need some help getting Windows up and running on my Early 2008 Macbook. It does have a weird set up, but I think it's possible. All I have is a 16gb SanDisk USB drive. So, here goes. I was trying to use bootcamp to install Windows but I partitioned the disk wrong and deleted my partition for OS X. I tried all the shortcuts, but nothing worked. I finally used Startup Disk Creator on a Dell laptop running Ubuntu and got Ubuntu 17.10 running on it using the SanDisk. All is well, but I don't necessarily like Ubuntu, and I didn't really like OS X that much. I want to use the Sandisk and get either Windows 10 or Windows 8.1 running. You have to remember that while the computer is 64-bit, it has a 32-bit EFI. Here are my specs: MacBook, 4GB Ram, 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo, 160GB HDD, Ubuntu 17.10 LTSI hope you guys can help me do this. Also, please don't hate or say \"Upgrade\" because, simply put, I can't as of now.
