O'CONNELL: We gotta get her back.
JONATHAN: I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
O'CONNELL: You know where he's taking her?
ARDETH RAY: Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
JONATHAN: And what ritual would that be?
ARDETH RAY: The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
JONATHAN: And how does one do that?
ARDETH RAY: By reading the Book Of The Dead.
JONATHAN: Oh yes, of course.
ARDETH RAY: And then killing your sister.
JONATHAN: Excuse me?
