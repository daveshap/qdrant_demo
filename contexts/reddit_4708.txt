I cant look at her anymore
Posted at r/depression as well, looking to get maybe support or reassurance from strangers. Or just more people to vent to
After recently moving in with my significant other weve had a nice life, a nice two bedroom apartment with a nice area. She moved from the other side of the state was out of a job cause of the move. No big deal. That was November 2019. As of March 2020 shes tried and tried and tried but she has yet to find anything, which is ok. Were at the point of struggling, and in my mind I cant ask for help from my parents because I'm self destructive and too stubborn. My job doesnt pay nearly enough. Our apartment is a mess, I'm overworked, tired, our bed remains broken cause it's made of cheap material. We sleep on couches. I give her the bigger one despite being a foot shorter than me. I'm in over my head. I'm forgetting things, I'm trying to escape. Shes holding up fine and trying to be positive, but I can hardly look at her. I feel like I've failed. I failed her, I failed us, I failed myself. I sit here on my couch looking out the window, crying, but not too loudly as to disturb her. Knowing she deserves better. I just want to jump off the balcony so she can have a better life
