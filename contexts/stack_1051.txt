Temporary guest session warning on user login Ever since upgrading from 14.04 to 16.04 (uneventfully), I am getting a warning popup on login titled:<blockquote>  Temporary Guest Session</blockquote>with the message:<blockquote>  All data created during this guest session will be deleted  when you log out, and settings will be reset to defaults. </blockquote>However, I am logging in as myself (username, password). And in fact changes to my account (desktop, browser history, etc.) are saved between sessions. Why am I getting that warning and how can I remove it?
