TOM: What's the matter, Grampa?
GRAMPA: Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
PA: What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
GRAMPA: I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
PA: But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
GRAMPA: All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
TOM: How 'bout Granma?
GRAMPA: Take her with you!
