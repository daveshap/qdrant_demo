Back in College, but Falling into Old Habits
I'm back in college after a five year break from completing high school. I've got a few assignments due, and am constantly getting sick due to stress. 

Physics and Chemistry are freaking me out, as some of the material, I do not fully understand but am too afraid to ask for help with it. I'm a very nervous individual and so I do not like to speak up often or look like I do not know something, for fear of what others will say or do to me. 

I know my fear of learning and asking questions likely comes from when I was younger, and my mother would yell and scream at me for hours when I tried to do my homework (if I messed up the answer to a question). That makes it hard to actually focus on my work to this day.

I have no idea how to overcome my nervous disposition, or my zoning out when actually trying to learn that's from previous abuse/bad experiences related to learning. 

I want to learn, I want to ask and I want to do well, but I don't know how.
