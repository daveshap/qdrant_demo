DON CORLEONE: When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
HAGEN: They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
DON CORLEONE: No, give him a living. But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
HAGEN: I've called the hospital; they've notified Consiglere Genco's family to come and wait. He won't last out the night.
