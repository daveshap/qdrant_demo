filed for unemployment but did not certify for benefits
I was laid off in Sep of 2019 from a contract position. I applied for unemployment online but did not certify for benefits. 

I subsequently got a job in Dec 2019 (after a month of interviewing) the contract which again got terminated in Feb 2020 (shortly before the outbreak)

When I login to CA EDD, it is asking me to reopen my old claim. 

Question1: Can I still collect unemployment for the period Sep-Dec 2019?

Question2: For the current period should I file a new claim?

State: California
