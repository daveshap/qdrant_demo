Book - ice world, ppl skate around, 'cutters', boy with black hair and red Ok read this a long time ago and have forgotten the title/ author. Set in an ice world, people skate around, there are tribes of outcasts called 'cutters' who can transform people's appearance. The main character has black hair, but with red hairs that come through as he gets older. His father was an unknown evil king or something with the same hair, his Mum would pluck the boys red hairs out so he wouldn't guess who his real father was. Thanks all!
