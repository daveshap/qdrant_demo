Research and writing as an art form
First year grad student, and while I haven't gotten too heavy in research yet, I've been enjoying it a lot when I've done it for my papers 

I was reading several articles yesterday while researching for my next paper when it hit me that research/writing are like a creative endeavor for me. Might sound strange to some, but I see it all as stitching together bits and pieces to form a larger piece of work; put another way, I'm DJ Shadow and I'm trying to create *Endtroducing...* (an album created entirely out of samples for those of you unfamiliar)

Anyone else take this sort of approach to research and writing?
