CHARLIE: I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
GIOVANNI: Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth... ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning? Heming?
CHARLIE: Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
GIOVANNI: You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
CHARLIE: Wasn't a book...was a short story.
MARIO: What was it?
CHARLIE: Nothing.
MARIO: No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
CHARLIE: Francis Macomber.""
MARIO: Wha?
