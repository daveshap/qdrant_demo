Has anyone else ever exerienced a period where they are in a panic attack mode (basically a never ending panic attack)
I'm currently in such a period and have no idea what's going on or what caused it. It's been like this for 4 days and i'm struggling to cope. I have no physical panic attack symptoms except muscle twitching but in my mind i'm extremely anxious for no reason and i feel like i'm dying
