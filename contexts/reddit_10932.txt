My best friend of ~18 years is engaged to the man who sexually assaulted me
I have always had a shitty life but this just takes the cake. 
In 2016 I was raped. It was the hardest time in my life, and I attempted suicide then. Clearly I survived and am still here. 
Tonight I just found out that the girl who I’ve been best friends with since we were in elementary is engaged to the boy who raped me. 
And yes she knows he raped me. She is very aware of the fact. 
It turns out she has been hooking up with him since my assault.  And they are now engaged. She’s somehow kept it a secret from me (I’ve moved away for college so we don’t see each other every day like we used to) but she accidentally forgot to untag herself from a post and so I saw a post of the two of them together in Facebook. 
This is the girl who calls me her sister, says she loves me more than anyone, tells me she’ll always be there for me. 

So it hit me tonight. No one actually fucking cares about me. Clearly not. The person who claimed to have cared the most about me is marrying the man who ruined my life. 
I feel like it’s 2016 all over again. I feel like all progress I’ve made is lost and I’m back right where I was. I don’t want to wake up tomorrow morning. I don’t know how to pretend everything’s fine anymore.
