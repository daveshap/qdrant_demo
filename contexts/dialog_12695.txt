MCCLEOD: You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
JENNIFER: And the other one -- he is like you?
MCCLEOD: He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me. We are the last of our kind. The last of the Calans. I do not know what purpose we were put here for. I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
JENNIFER: Where will you go now?
MCCLEOD: It will end tonight.
JENNIFER: Must you fight him?
MCCLEOD: He will not stop until it is over.
MCCLEOD: Good evening, Lieutenant.
BEDSOE: No -- it isn't. A cop died today and the other is barely holding on. I want some answers, Nash.
MCCLEOD: I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
BEDSOE: That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on. You're connected to this guy somehow. He's after you -- just like the others were.
MCCLEOD: It's late.
BEDSOE: Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords. One cut off the others head. He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
MCCLEOD: Maybe he was a lousy shot.
BEDSOE: Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
MCCLEOD: Most people are afraid of death.
