MARTIN: ...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
MARCELLA: Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
MARTIN: Patch him through....
MARTIN: What do you want?
GROCER: I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
MARTIN: Like a union?
GROCER: Like a club. Work less, make more.
MARTIN: Thank you, no.
GROCER: We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
MARTIN: And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
GROCER: It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
MARTIN: Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
GROCER: I'm gonna get you, kid.
