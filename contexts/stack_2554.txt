What is the most convenient coordinates format to store data for spatial queries: WGS84 or OSGB36? I have datasets that come in different coordinate formats as WGS84 (4326) and OSGB36 (27700).Clients are consuming the \"published\" data as format WGS84.So at the moment, all the data since the earliest stages are saved as WGS84.However all the intermediate transformations are based on ST_Intersects, ST_DWithin, etc. So can I consider as rule of thumb: working with data as OSGB36 for faster calculations (cartesian coordinates) and converting to WGS84 only for the published data?
