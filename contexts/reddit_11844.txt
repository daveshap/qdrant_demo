My grandma is losing her memory.
My grandma, who's been one of my best friends throughout my life (I'm 20 now) is talking more and more about how her memory has been going.  She's started keeping a journal with people's names and dates of importance (my parents wedding days and birthdays, mine and my brother's birthdays, etc) and it's been getting to me a little bit.  My great grandmother passed away about five years ago.  She had dementia and my disowned great aunt Peggie essentially tricked her into writing that everything went to Peggie in the will.  Not that anything like that is going to happen in my family, but I'm remembering that and thinking about how sad the whole thing was.

When I say she's my best friend, what I mean is that since I was a really little kid she's done a lot for me.  She and my granddad used to live in Virginia, and I have so many incredible memories there.  They used to take me to Colonial Williamsburg as a little kid, and to this day the memories are inseparable.  We're also the same myers-briggs type, so we're very similar people

I don't know how to deal with it.  I don't want to talk to her about it quite yet, but has anyone been through the same thing?

EDIT:  Thanks everyone, I really appreciate it.  Your input means a lot, I'll definitely try some of the things you suggested.  I generally feel a bit better about it.
