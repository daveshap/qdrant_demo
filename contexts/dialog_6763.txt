JACK: Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
MATT: What the fuck are you talking about?
JACK: That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
MATT: I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
JACK: I'm not going to report it.
MATT: What are you, a cop?
JACK: If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
MATT: I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
JACK: Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
MATT: So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money. I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
JACK: You're talking about complicity.
MATT: I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
