MR. WHITE: Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
MR. ORANGE: I'm okay.
MR. WHITE: Correct.
MR. WHITE: Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
MR. ORANGE: Joe.
MR. WHITE: Bet your sweet ass we are.
