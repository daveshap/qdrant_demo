Choosing an intership iver a full time job while in masters school
Just woundering what the communities thoughts are over this as I am in the (positive) situation now where I'm at a new job but  learning is not prioritized....I have an opportunity to work at a better firm in the same coty I go to school in.

The catch is the job is for 3 months..as opposed to a year.

Anyone ever take an intership over a job?
