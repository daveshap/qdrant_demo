Changing careers from corporate world to... anything else?
I've been with my company for just over 4 years, and have just changed roles 2 months ago. I'm not enjoying it at all - has a lot to do with the management structure. I go through cycles of "everything is fine" to "I hate this and need a change". This is my first "real" job after university and living in Vancouver I can't afford a pay cut. I've thought about going back to school, but with my government student loan where it's at that's not feasible. How does one change careers so early on? Do I just grin and bear it until I'm in a better place? Any advice would be much appreciated.

Edit: I should add that my current career is not related to my field of study.
