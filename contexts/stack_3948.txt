Meaning of chi-squared in R Kruskal-Wallis test I have a simple question to ask, I think it was not covered in other questions.I am running a Kruskal-Wallis test in R, using the function kruskal.test.The output gives me the p-value and a chi-squared value (see example below)<blockquote>  Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test    data:  mat[, 2] by mat[, 3]    Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 0.052043, df = 1, p-value = 0.8195</blockquote>I know that I have to look at the p-value to know if there is a significant difference among the groups I'm testing, but I am interested in the chi-squared. I noticed that the chi-square increases when the p-value decreases, but its statistical meaning is not yet clear to me.There is not an explanation of its meaning in ?kruskal.test. Can someone help me understand this?
