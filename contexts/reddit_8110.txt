How accurate were Donald Trump's remarks today relating to the incidents over the weekend in Charlottesville, VA?
The Unite the Right rally was a gathering of far-right groups to protest against the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials from August 11th-12th.  The official rally was cancelled due to a declaration of a [state of emergency] (https://governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/newsarticle?articleId=20924) by Gov. Terry McAuliffe on the 12th.

Despite this declaration multiple reports of violence surfaced both before and after the scheduled event [2] (http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/12/542982015/home-to-university-of-virginia-prepares-for-violence-at-white-nationalist-rally) [3] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/us/charlottesville-protest-white-nationalist.html).  19 people were injured and one woman was killed when a car crashed into a [crowd of counterprotesters] (http://www.wcnc.com/news/clashes-erupt-as-thousands-descend-on-charlottesville-for-unite-the-right-rally-counter-protest/463871802).

Today President Trump made comments equating the [demonstrators with counterprotesters] (http://www.npr.org/2017/08/15/543743845/another-reversal-trump-now-says-counterprotesters-also-to-blame-for-charlottesvi).  

>"Ok what about the alt left that came charging â€” excuse me. What about the alt left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? Let me ask you this, what about the fact they came charging, that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. As far as I'm concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day."

Governor McAuliffe made a [public statement] (http://www.nbc12.com/story/36142848/gov-mcauliffe-releases-statement-regarding-pres-trumps-press-conference) disputing the President.
