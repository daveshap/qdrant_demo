Is it net good or bad for the US that 11 nations agreed to a modified version of the TPP and excluded the US? What are the implications for the USA?
Today Steve Mnuchin said he [wasn't concerned by the development](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mnuchin-unconcerned-by-pacific-pact-that-excludes-u-s-1516787419) by the [recent TPP agreement](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tpp-members-reach-agreement-a-year-after-u-s-exit-1516709064) between 11 nations, but not the US. Is he right to feel that way?

It seems Canadians have their reservations about this, where for example [dairy farmers will be impacted](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/transpacific-trade-deal-tpp-signing-freeland-1.3418567) by opening up Canadian markets to foreign imports. However [other sectors like mining](http://www.miningweekly.com/article/canadian-miners-welcome-agreement-on-trans-pacific-partnership-2018-01-24) are welcoming the agreement.

What are the implications of a revived TPP for the USA?
