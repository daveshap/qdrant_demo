How do people do things all day?
This whole quarantine thing got me thinking.

It's normal to me to stay in when I have free time. I basically do nothing, just playing games and watching stuff. Recently my uni classes started online (I live with my partner in our own apartment), I'm starting to sort all the stuff I procrastinated way too long, and I got back into contact with an old friend who I play games with too. 

Is this normal routine for mentally healthy people? Like, do they just do a bunch of stuff one after another without getting really tired? Do they have breaks, and what do they do in these breaks? I think I've been stuck in my own loop for so long that I feel like a really old phone battery. Fully charged in the morning, but rapidly decreasing by the minute and any task. I think I kind of forgot what it's like to function normally, cause I never really did. 

I don't know. I just hear from many people that are stuck inside how they just want to do things and go outside. And I'm asking myself - do what? I genuinely don't know how they have energy for this. I'm not ranting, cause I'm happy for these people and hope they can do these things again soon. And I'd wish I could too, but it just seems so... exhausting.
