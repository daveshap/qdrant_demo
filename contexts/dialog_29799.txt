CLARENCE: No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
ALABAMA: I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
CLARENCE: It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
DICK: Now's a helluva time to play what if"."
CLARENCE: This is our last chance to play what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught."

CLARENCE: Yeah, let's just get outta here.
