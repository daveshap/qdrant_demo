I hate how much trouble I have with reading and comprehension.
It's such a conscious effort to actually absorb and process the information which the words are coming together to form. If I'm not careful, I'll read a whole page of a novel or more without actually knowing what I've just read. I have to slow down so much that the size of most novels becomes so daunting, I get discouraged and don't set time aside to read.

Even when I do get through a chapter, somehow I feel like I'm only getting a blurry gist of what's going on, rather than the clear picture most readers seem to describe when they refer to imagining what they're reading. And not too long after finishing a book, I can barely remember anything about it.

Lots of video games these days tell their story via "audiologs": snippets of exposition or narration that play back as the player continues to move around and interact with the game. I can't retain any of the information I'm hearing unless I stop playing and just listen until the log is finished.

I love stories and want to discover as many as I can, but focusing on the content and truly comprehending it is such a chore, and it's very disheartening.
