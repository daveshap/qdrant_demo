Wake up, browse reddit, watch porn, contemplate suicide, repeat
Man fuck this shit. People say it gets better, no it gets worse. Legitimately considering trying to stab myself in the jugular. I was sexually abused and mutilated and no one cares. People laugh at my problems call me crazy. Theres to much contradiction here. Hurt me, tell me its no big deal, tell me i'll get over it, laugh at me. Either kill me or care for me I can't stand this inbetween flip floppy bull shit. Its torture. Everyone would be better without me anyway I'm just a problem generator. It hurts so much. If theres a god he knows no mercy.



Edit fuck, man i need some weed. I need some love. Maybe I'll find some at the bottom of the river
