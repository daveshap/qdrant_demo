MCGRAW: Hot goddamn day!
PETE: Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
MCGRAW: Not even for lunch?
PETE: I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
MCGRAW: Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
PETE: Whatsamatter?
MCGRAW: Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
PETE: Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
MCGRAW: Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
PETE: You could sue the shit out of her, ya know. That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. You could own that fuckin' place.
MCGRAW: What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
PETE: That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
MCGRAW: Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians. And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.
MCGRAW: They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
PETE: Knock yourself out.
