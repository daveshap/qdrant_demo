DE VRIES: What? Are you nuts? Just the two of us?
GUTTIEREZ: I've seen this mother, De Vries. We can bag it, no problem.
DE VRIES: Forget it, man.
GUTTIEREZ: C'mon De Vries. Think of the bonus.
DE VRIES: Fuck the bonus. I hate heights. You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
DE VRIES: What the hell are you doing?
GUTTIEREZ: Hey, fair enough. If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
