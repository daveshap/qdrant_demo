Formatted my whole external hard drive I'm so new to Ubuntu, I just started playing with it 19 hours ago. I'm really not 100% sure what I'm doing, so please excuse the mistakes in terminology and general processes.As I was attempting to make my Samsung 740U3M able to dual boot, I had no extra USB drives except my external hard drive. I used etcher to put the ISO on the drive, but the website said it wouldn't delete everything.It did delete everything when I put the ISO on there. So, I powered down the machine and bought a second 32GB USB drive to install from. I now have the latest Ubuntu and updates installed on the internal HDD.Is there any way to save the stuff from my external hard drive? I haven't used it, so I don't believe it's been overwritten. Please help!? I'm an undergrad and all of my work was on there!EDIT It's not a duplicate of that question because he was trying to make an image of his HDD, whereas I was trying to put the ISO \"next to\" my files on my external HDD. Etcher \"flashed\" my HDD when it put the ISO on the HDD. I'm currently running a quick search in TestDisk. Instructions called for me to check the \"Intel\" option for the search.
