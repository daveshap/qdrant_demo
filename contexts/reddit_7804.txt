[Mendeley] How to group many citations in just one?
What I have: \[1-3\]

What I want: \[1\] a), b), c) 

[Here is an example](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-jikRiUVpL4o/XsQq3hM2OaI/AAAAAAAABUM/suRtVhTuQHQ5I1X-HzYElYix2yAYm7_qACK8BGAsYHg/s0/2020-05-19.png) with multiple references in one - ref # 87.

Does anyone know how to do it?
