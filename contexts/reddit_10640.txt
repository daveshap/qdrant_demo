Caution: There's a PM troll active in SW. If you get a nasty message after posting here, be aware that this person is doing this randomly, and IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.
We're doing all we can to put a stop to this criminal (at least one person we're aware of has gone to prison for inciting suicide online) activity, but in the meantime, please be forewarned.  

This person is using freshly-created accounts for hateful messages to our OPs.  If you get one, do let us know, and click "report" on the PM which both brings it to the attention of the admins and permanently removes it from your inbox.  

**Edit:**  If you don't feel comfortable posting because of this risk, please feel free to [message the mod team](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) instead.  We will be glad to talk to you privately.
