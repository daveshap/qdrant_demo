Customer claimed he had the virus and they let him go.
I work for a dollar store, and last night a customer was talking to his neighbor in line and made comment that he tested positive for covid-19 but after 2 weeks of no symptoms they released him. I told my manager for that night and she looked concerned as I did, so she took over register as I started cleaning like mad. Then I washed my hands and sanitized as well. But we had to continue to work the shift out. 

When I got home I touched nothing, told my mother and she told me “You’re panicking, he said he had it, they wouldn’t have let him go if they thought he was a hazard. You did what you should now leave it alone” 

I also doubt that anyone will call corporate hq about the incident and I will still have to go into work, I won’t know until tomorrow night. 

Is there anything I can do in this situation?
