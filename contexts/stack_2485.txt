Unsupervised classification in Google Earth Engine I know, an example of Unsupervised classification was given on GEE but it is not really unsupervised approach as it still needs training. I am looking for the way to perform unsupervised classification without giving training data and the algorithm groups the pixels with common characteristics (number of classes).Here is the link for the example: developers.google.com/earth-engine/clustering. I want a very simple unsupervised classification which does not need training. In any RS software, you have an option to simply apply unsupervised classification on an image without defining the classes. It only needs a number of classes and the software does the classification based on common characteristics.
