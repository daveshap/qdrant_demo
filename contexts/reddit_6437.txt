You should stop participating in Indeed’s online assessments: and here’s why.
Let’s talk about Indeed Assessments.

Over my time of applying for jobs in the past, I have done a few of these so called assessments from Indeed. Personally, I will no longer be doing these, and neither should you. Here’s why. 

The job market is tough enough as it is and people who are applying to jobs day in and day out don’t need to waste anymore of their time. 

If the employer doesn’t see enough value in the applicant’s resume and experience (which also holds their contact information) and decides to automate one of the most important areas of researching job candidates, then that indicates to the job applicant that his/her respective company is a waste of time. 

It’s yet another way of attempting to get something for nothing by companies, which is the only thing that businesses revolve around these days. 

Indeed Assessments are gimmicks used by companies who are not capable of making job hiring decisions based on qualifications and interpersonal communication. 

People are more than happy to answer questions over the phone, in person, or email IF  the employer is willing to invest their time.

E: Can’t forget about the companies wanting you to film yourself answering useless questions and sending the video to them as part of an “interview” (thx to the people in the comments for reminding me)
