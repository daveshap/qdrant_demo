CRASH: Sorry about last night.
NUKE: Forget it.
CRASH: I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon. D'you understand that?
NUKE: No.
CRASH: You will. Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it. Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat. That's the secret. You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
NUKE: Fear and ignorance.
CRASH: No. Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
NUKE: I know. I just like to see you get all worked up.
NUKE: Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya... She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
CRASH: I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
NUKE: Maybe you do. Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
CRASH: It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
NUKE: Yeah, thanks for everything.
CRASH: Nuke-- Good luck.
NUKE: You too...Meat.
ANNIE: Well I guess this is it.
NUKE: I won't be needing these anymore.
ANNIE: Neither will I.
NUKE: I think I'm ready for the Show.
ANNIE: Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
NUKE: Don't worry.
NUKE: I gotta go now, Dad.
FATHER: I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
NUKE: No. If I screw up, I wanta do it alone. I'll call.
FATHER: We'll be praying for you.
NUKE: Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
FATHER: We'll pray anyway.
NUKE: If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it. I gotta run--
