CLAY: Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
WHALE: Did you now?
CLAY: I liked it. We all did.
WHALE: Did anyone laugh?
CLAY: No.
WHALE: Pity. People are so earnest nowadays.
CLAY: Why? Was it supposed to be funny?
WHALE: Of course. I had to make it interesting for myself, you see. A comedy about death. The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke. But the Monster never receives any of my gibes. He is noble. Noble and misunderstood.
