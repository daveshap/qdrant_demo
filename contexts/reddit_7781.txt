Advice for learning python for grad school?
I'm an incoming phd student and wanted to spend my free time this summer doing some lowkey prep before the fall. One of the things I've heard is helpful is learning python (rn i've most only used matlab). Was wondering if anyone had recs/tips/ways to approach learning python? I have basic coding experience, and I expect I'll mostly be using python for various data analysis, nothing too crazy (measuring and characterizing devices and materials I fabricate). I was thinking of using simple free online crash courses to learn the syntax, but if anyone has ideas for practicing in a way that's relevant to my basic needs in research, I'm all ears!
