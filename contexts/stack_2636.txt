Do I need to do Radiometric Normalization for time series analysis, if I'm using L2_Landsat8_SR data? I'm doing some forest change detection across several years using L2_Landsat8 Surface Reflectance data. And I am implementing the method available in R (landsat::relnorm) for relative radiometric normalization of the images, so they can be compared between dates. But someone mentioned that the SR_Landsat8 images are already normalized, although I haven't managed to find any information confirming this. Not sure if he was referring to something else.Could someone clarify whether I need to normalize all the images of the time series using a master image or whether Level 2 Surface Reflectance data are ready to be compared between dates?
