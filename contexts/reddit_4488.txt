What are signs of depression?
Are suicidal thoughts really a sign of depression? What about binge watching shows from my childhood instead of doing work or cleaning? Is that a sign of depression or is that just me being lazy? Inconsistent shower schedule, awkward relationship with food, not being able to engage or connect with people in your life, constantly daydreaming, etc. Like, what’s a healthy life supposed to look like? Are there actually people who wake up in the morning and start the day without feeling miserable about it? Is the key to just not think about it? 

Idk what I’m expecting the answers on this to be. Idek if this post is going to get any replies. But, I just started seeing a therapist, and I’m scared that this is it and that I’m going to be stuck like this forever. So, if anyone wants to tackle this question, I’d really appreciate it...
