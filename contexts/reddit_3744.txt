Online Dating - Tips from an Average Joe (with examples)!
First of all, hey. How are you doing? This will be the first and last time I open like this. Unless you’re a model or Chris Hemsworth levels of attractive, you should never open up with “Hey” or “How are you?”. If you stop reading now and take anything away from this post, let it be this.


I’m a 24 year old male student, average plus looking, I’d give me a 6 or 7, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I don’t have a fancy job or even a car, I’m a pretty average man who has had a great amount of success on dating apps. After lurking around and trying to improve my game and myself, I’d like to share what personally helped me improve my chances to translate a match into a date.

*Disclaimer* I'm a straight man, so I'll be sharing my experience talking and meeting up with Straight/Bi women. Most of the advice here can be applied for every person you meet online. Plus English isn't my first language and I'm translating all of these convos from my language, happy reading!


**Opener**

Openers are important. They are. You should always think of a good one, with the balance of being witty, funny and charming, while not sounding too “try-hardy”. Sounds tricky, and at first it is, but a good opener improves your chance significantly to get a date with the girl you’re talking to. Still don’t think openers are important? I’ll share a story.

I live with two female roommates. We’re pretty open with each other and share stories about our dating lives quite often. One night we’re hanging out and we talk about dating apps, one thing led to another and they ended up both creating accounts that same night. They both got over 100 likes. In less than an hour. Woke up in the morning and one had 300 and the other 400. After 24 hours they both got over 999+ likes. 

Point of the story is, if it wasn’t obvious already, women tend to have a lot more option than men on dating apps. For every girl you’re talking to, there’s 19 other guys texting her and sending her messages. 50% of those men will probably open with “Hey”, or “How are you doing?” or some variation of that. Men who want to improve their chances need to stand out of the crowd. If our appearance isn’t going to help us stand out, our opener will. So how do we do that? 

Think to yourself “What do you like about this girl?” “Why did I swipe on her in the first place?” “What’s attractive to me about her?” Thought of something? Good. Take that idea/compliment/statement and add a little twist to it. Complimenting is always better than “hey”, but something even better is to take that statement and be playful or tease a little bit. I read a tip on the "dating advice" sub by [LeatherDaddyLongLegs](https://www.reddit.com/user/LeatherDaddyLonglegs) which I agree with- If you're going to compliment someone, compliment them on something they have control over. I’ll give a few IRL examples of openers that got me numbers. Bear with me since I’m translating from my native tongue to English:

Girl with a bio stating she’s studying engineering, has a dog in one of her pictures:

    Me: “I’ll be honest with you, I just want to meet your puppy, but I haven’t found her on the app yet.”
    Her: “Haha it’s a he. Are you still sure that you want to meet him?”
    Me: “Sure, but make sure he doesn’t have any expectations. Maybe I’ll meet a cute engineer along the way.”

Girl with a bio stating her hobbies include singing in the shower, generic pictures:

    Me: “I hope you like singing outside the shower as well, you can complete my duet while we cook dinner”
    Her: “Hahaha, I’m not sure that you want to hear me sing. But I am pretty good in the kitchen.”
    Me: “Stir-fry is my specialty, but I’ve got some more recipes up my sleeve. When we grab a drink, you can hint what you prefer”

And my favorite: Girl with generic picture, no bio or bio consisting of a random emoji (Like what the hell is that supposed to mean)

These ones are tricky and are pretty common. Go back to what I wrote before. Why did you swipe on this girl? Is it because she’s cute? Is it because she’s throwing off good vibes? Does she seem like a genuinely good person? Take that thought and add a twist. It’s like a cold open, but for dating apps. If you meet someone IRL, you can ask them a question about something fun, or you can make an assumption about her. This works in dating apps as well, do that and let the conversation flow from there.

Examples:

“You seem like a fun person to be around, I’ll see if I’m right when we grab a drink”

“You seem like the athletic type, or did you just snap a cute picture to show off?”

Experiment with your openers, and don't be afraid to be daring. Don't play it safe, tease and have fun all while being respectable of the person you're talking to. By the end of the day, we're all here to enjoy ourselves.

**Getting her off the app**

You thought of a witty opener, and she responded. Great! Now what? 

Every person is different, some will give you a dry answer to your opener, some a “hahaha (add emoji here)”, some will give you some material to work with and some won’t answer (you can’t win them all). Your job is to get her off the app and into your phone/Snapchat/Instagram as smoothly as possible. Use texting as a means to an end, you’re not trying to build a connection via texting. You guys both swiped on each other. Take that as a hint that she’s attracted to you. My general rules of thumb to do this as effectively as possible are:

1.)	No interview questions- You’re not trying to get to know her. You’re trying to get her on a date, so you can meet up face to face and get to know her then. NOT VIA TEXTING. Imagine this scenario:

You’re a girl with 20 messages in your inbox. 10 of them say “hey” (or some variation of that). She answers 3 of those messages because the guys follow rule 1 to an insane degree. She looks at the other 10. One asks her “What do you do for work?” She answers a dry answer. Another, “What do you do for fun?” She answers another short response. “How do you enjoy spending your spare time?” She doesn’t answer and gets off the app. 

Texting shouldn’t be a chore and getting bombarded with questions isn’t fun. Interviews are dreadful enough, imagine if you got 10 interview questions every day. You probably wouldn’t answer them all, and eventually you wouldn’t bother with them all together. I'm guilty of texting the girl a lot before the date to get to know her. I learned that the effect is more negative than positive. If you don't have anything interesting to share or say, you're better off not texting at all.

2.)	Text with a purpose- What’s your goal? Why are you texting her? Imagine texting like a path from point A to point B. Your job is to get from Point A (matching) to Point B (a date) as smoothly as possible. Don't make the mistake and mindlessly text her like I used to, navigate the conversation towards that. One way I like to do it is:

    Me: “(Some statement on something we talked about), I’ll see if I’m right when we meet up for a beer. Or are you more into wine?”
    Her: “I like both to be honest”
    Me: “And when we grab a drink next week, what would you prefer?”
    Her: “Hahaha, well it would honestly depend on my mood.”
    Me: “Give me your number and we’ll see when we can make that happen.”
    Her: “Haha #####”

Always think a step ahead on how to navigate your opener into fun banter, from fun banter to hinting that you should go out, and if you get a good response from her, get her number. 

3.)	Banter > Questions – Asking questions is good for one thing- to get the banter rolling. If you don’t have information to work with, asking a good question can get the ball rolling and can get her to share more, which gives you more information to work with, which leads to better banter, which leads to a better chance of you getting a number. I’ll use an example where I ended up double-texting after she didn’t respond and got a number (and eventually a date):

    Me: “Good thing my A/C is working so I can chill after being let out to dry”(Bad translation)
    Her: “Sorry, I didn’t see your message”
    Me: “Happens to the best of us. So how does your athletic side come into play?” (I assumed before that she had an athletic side to her)
    Her: “I was on the national gymnastics team.”
    Me: “Do you also do cartwheels and handstands on random objects in your apartment?”
    Her: “Hahahaha not really, I’ve gotten lazy”
    Me: “Too bad, that could’ve been a sight to behold. How about we get off this app and you give me your number?”
    Her: “Haha alright ######”

4.)	Close on a high note – Don’t ask for a number out of the blue, because if you do that, you’ll mostly be brushed off, or worse, get ghosted. Look at the examples above. If you get a good laugh from her or if she’s responsive towards going out with you, it’s a good sign to try and close her number/social media. She’s much more likely to give to you as well. Worst case scenario she says no, brush it off and change the subject.


**Setting up a Date**

Congrats! You’ve charmed her and you’ve got her phone number (I don’t do Snapchat or IG personally). Send her a text with a GIF (bitches love GIFs) or something witty and try setting up logistics. I’ll walk you through my thought process:

Ask her out to X activity on date Y, her response is...:

**Yes:** Great! You’re all set, send her a text back that you’ll see her on date Y, you’re excited to see her or something sweet of the sort and end the conversation. Check back on her at the date that you’re going to meet up to make sure you’re set to meet up on that day.

**No, but I’m free on Z:** Great! If you’re free aswell, set up on that date and follow the directions above.

**No:** Okay, why did she say no?

**“I’m busy, I won’t be able to”** – Alright, at this point I’d brush it off and ask her when she’s available. If she doesn’t give me a definitive answer, I’ll 
send her something like: “That’s fine, hit me up and take care”, and stop talking to her. The ball’s in her court now and you shouldn’t be hounding girls 
who won’t make a little bit of effort to meet up. Remember, dating is a two-way street. Don't waste your time on people who won't give you the time of day.

If she does give you an answer, she’s interested and try setting up the date.

**“I get off work really late”/”I have to study until late”’/”I’m too tired” etc.** – This isn’t a hard no. She’s making excuses on why she can’t come. This is 
where persuasion comes in, convince her that you’re worth it, just make sure you’re not too pushy. I follow a rule I learned while I was working in sales: 

If I get one "no"- Why did she say no? Agree with the reason and try to persuade and charm her otherwise. If you get a second no, drop it and talk to her at a different opportunity. Nothing is a bigger turn off than neediness, and the last thing you want is to pressure someone into doing something they're not comfortable with.

People are willing to sacrifice sleep and time if they believe they’re going to have a good time. I’ll share an example of something that happened to me last week, with a girl that lives 40 minutes from me (sadly I don’t have a car ATM):

(Background: We decided we’ll be spontaneous, that we’ll meet up today and she’ll drive to me, but it will depend on how she is after work)

    Her: Hey, I think I won’t make the drive today :( (Not cancelling yet, just thinking about it)
    Me: It’s all good, we’ll find a different time.
    Her: Sorry, I know it’s not very spontaneous of me.
    Me: I expected more from you, maybe I’ll see your spontaneous side at a different opportunity.
    Her: Haha always have low expectations, I have to find the energy to make the drive (Warming up a little)
    Me: Grab a cup of coffee and drive. Worst case scenario that you’re exhausted and can’t drive home, you can sleep on my comfy couch. (Teasing a bit)
    Her: Hahaha what?? Instead of offering me to sleep in your room you’re offering me the couch?
    Me: You can order me a drink first before you jump into my bed
    Her: Haha
    Me: Anyways, if you’re feeling spontaneous hit me up. I’m going back to my books to study, they need some attention.
    Her: They deserve it haha! Alright, I have 11 minutes to decide.
    Me: (Insert happy GIF)
    Her: Alright I’ll come.

If you've come this far, thank you for reading and I hope you found this useful. Good luck and happy dating!

**Thanks to everyone who upvoted and commented! It's always good to see other people's opinions and get another perspective. I'm considering writing up another one of these, but more along the lines of how I like to date-prep after the date is set up.**
