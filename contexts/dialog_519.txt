MARSHAL: Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
CORRADO: So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
MARSHAL: I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
CORRADO: I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
MARSHAL: But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
CORRADO: Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
MARSHAL: I think it's possible.
