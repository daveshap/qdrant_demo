26 and never pursued a career, where to learn about my options?
I've worked in retail since I was 18 and nothing else. I was interested in trades for a while and got a construction job but I walked out on my first day because I absolutely hated working in an outdoor and unprofessional environment.

I have no interests that can translate into careers. All I want is a job that pays well without having to spend too much time in school for, that I can do indoors in a professional environment. My greatest asset is that I can stay calm and composed no matter the situation. I'd prefer not to rely on people too much, I prefer working my job alone.

I've looked over nearby college courses and taking a few online career tests but nothing jumps out at me and it's hard to get an idea of exactly what each job is like just by reading about it. The only thing of mild interest is computer programming but it says on the website that you should be good at working with others and I've always hated relying on other people.

Any ideas are greatly appreciated, thanks.
