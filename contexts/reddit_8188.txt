Jeff Sessions has asked 46 U.S. attorneys to resign even though they don't have a replacement yet, what are the implications and consequences of this action?
Some Info:

Attorney general Jeff Sessions has asked the 46 remaining (of 93) federal attorneys nominated by the previous administration to resign. [source](http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2009/05/obama-to-replace-us-attorneys-018390) 

In 2009 this is what Eric Holder had to say about replacing the Bush appointed U.S. Attorneys "One of the things that we didn’t want to do was to disrupt the continuity of the offices and pull people out of positions where we thought there might be a danger that that might have on the continuity--the effectiveness of the offices.But...elections matter--it is our intention to have the U.S. Attorneys that are selected by President Obama in place as quickly as they can."

>Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said that Flores said the action is not unusual. A similar step was taken at the start of the Clinton administration. Sessions himself was asked to resign as the U.S. attorney in Alabama in March 1993 by Clinton’s attorney general, Janet Reno.

but it also notes that

> the George W. Bush administration eased U.S. attorneys out gradually while officials sought replacements, as did Obama’s Justice Department.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, issued a statement saying: “I’m surprised to hear that President Trump and Attorney General Sessions have abruptly fired all 46 remaining U.S. attorneys.  "

“In January, I met with Vice President Pence and White House Counsel Donald McGahn and asked specifically whether all U.S. attorneys would be fired at once. Mr. McGahn told me that the transition would be done in an orderly fashion to preserve continuity. Clearly this is not the case. I’m very concerned about the effect of this sudden and unexpected decision on federal law enforcement," she said.  [source](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/10/ag-sessions-asks-remaining-46-us-attorneys-to-resign.html) 

From what i understand in [this](http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/23/nation/na-talking23) article, while Clinton asked for letters of resignation all at once from all the Attorneys, they still ended up staying until their replacements were nominated, something that, from what i understand, Sessions is not doing, meaning he wants them all gone ASAP.
