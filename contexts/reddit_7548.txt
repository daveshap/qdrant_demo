terrified to start drafting
hey y’all, and happy new year! I suppose the post title says it all—I’m scared to death of beginning to draft my masters thesis. I have plenty of research material and notes to go on at the moment, and my advisor also told me I’m in a good position to start rough drafting. he also said he’d like me to have at least a little something on paper before classes start up again next week. but I don’t have anything because I know it’s going to be bad. I know I have to let myself be imperfect—that’s the whole point of a “rough draft,” after all. I’ve told numerous undergrads who were scared of writing their capstones the same thing, yet I have a hard time with it myself. has anyone else felt like this, and if you have how did you get yourself past it? I know I ought to get something on paper since it’ll be easier in the long run if I get an early start but I can’t mentally get over my fear of imperfection 😖
