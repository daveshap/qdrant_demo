Failed one of those "would you rather" pre-job assessments and I meet all the preferred qualifications for the job. What now?
 There is an internship that I found that I am very interested in. I met all the basic qualifications and 4/5 of the preferred qualifications. The preferred qualifications are things that only a small amount of people have. I spent hours on the cover letter and perfecting my resume. Sweet. The problem is that they sent me one of those assessments where they ask questions of you strongly disagree/disagree/agree/strongly disagree on a number of topics. I completed the assessment and a day later, I got an email at 1:30am saying that I failed the assessment and that I would have to wait 6 months if I wanted to reapply. Is there anything that I can do to counter this situation? I know that I am qualified for the position but it looks like a computer kicked me out of the recruitment process. Thanks.
