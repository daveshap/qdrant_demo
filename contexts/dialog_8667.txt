CLEMENTINE: You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
JOEL: I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
CLEMENTINE: You remember what happened next?
JOEL: I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
CLEMENTINE: -- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
JOEL: There's this guy!
CLEMENTINE: What?
JOEL: There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
CLEMENTINE: Really? Is he cute?
JOEL: He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
CLEMENTINE: Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
CLEMENTINE: What's wrong with me?
PATRICK: Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
