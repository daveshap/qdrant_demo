REED: You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
SUE: I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
SUE: When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
REED: Why didn't you say something?
SUE: That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now.
