3 weeks ago i attempted suicide and no one knows
November 23, 2019 I attempted suicide. I have not told anyone, or very little people. I tried to hang myself due to a broken heart and stress. After the attempt i started to view the world around me differently and see that maybe i am wanted.... I haven't really felt the need to take my life after that as i met a guy whom i like a lot. The work day after my suicide attempt was different, I noticed people actually seemed to care. Or, i saw some accomplishment in myself. I yet to seek help for my mental issues, but so far im trying to figure things out.
