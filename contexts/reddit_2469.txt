What are the common mistakes/misunderstandings you see new from college graduates in their first job?
What are the common mistakes/misunderstandings you see from new college graduates when they work at their first job? Examples of 'things I wish I knew earlier in my career' or mistakes you have seen from others.

For instance, I observe many new grads view HR as their personal 'career counselors' and are later surprised when a conflict with their boss or coworker doesn't work out as they expected.
