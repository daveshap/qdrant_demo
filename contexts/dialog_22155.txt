LUKE: He's my father.
LEIA: Your father?
LUKE: There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
LEIA: Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
LUKE: You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
LUKE: Yes. It's you Leia.
LEIA: I know. Somehow...I've always known.
LUKE: Then you know why I have to face him.
LEIA: No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
LUKE: No, you don't. You've always been strong.
LEIA: But, why must you confront him?
LUKE: Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
