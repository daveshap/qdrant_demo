Neural networks, batch vs sequential learning I've currently implemented a neural network and I want to know which works better, the sequential learning or the batch learning. As far as I understand, the batch learning is more efficient than the sequential learning, but according to the tests I've made, there is barely any difference between the accuracy of the two learning styles. Worth to notice is that I have a binary classification problem. My question is therefore, is there anything I can do to really showcase the difference between them, is one better for smaller type of training, more complex decision boundaries etc? Thanks in advance!
