Are you depressed? Lack of support?
Hey,

If you feel down and need an advice?

Remember these things.

1. Stay calm - for few seconds atlest you must be                    blank, stay away from struggles you are into.
2. Try to Remember your loved ones,  may be your dad or your mom or your pet.
3. Close your eyes take deep breath till you fill comfortable - this will help you to relax.
4. Don't take decisions when you are depressed, just don't take.
5.  If you still panic try mediation - if you wonder what mediation is? It's very  simple - just concentrate on your inhale and exhale. Just do this for sometime.

By now I trust you would be little better , now try to speak to someone you trust.

You can contact me anytime.

I really want to help as many as possible.
