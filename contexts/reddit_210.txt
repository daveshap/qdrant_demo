Tips for overcoming stage fright? First Talent Show
I just moved to a new school this august and I’ve had a hard time adjusting. I’m a good student, so my grades are fine, and getting around isn’t actually any trouble. I’m even in a club. I’ve just had a hard time getting close to anyone since they’ve all know each other since elementary school (kinder to highschool are basically on the same campus, a parking lot separates them). 

In April my school will be holding a poetry/music night and I’m considering auditioning for it. The thing is, I’ve never been on stage, save for middle 
school orchestra, piano recitals, and one really bad open mic experience when I was 14. 

I think it’d be a good opportunity to get myself out there, work on my public speaking / performance, and maybe I’d meet people from it, but I have really bad anxiety over it. Im also scared that if I do end up letting my nerves get the best of me and mess it all up, it’ll just isolate me more than I already am. 

I told two friends I was considering it and they both said I should give it a shot, but I’m thinking that I might just be biting off more than I can chew or Im getting overconfident and overestimating my skills?

I don’t know, should I just go for it? And if I should, how do I work on decreasing my anxiety over it?
