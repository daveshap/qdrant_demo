VOGELSANG: I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
MAX: Here's your money.
VOGELSANG: Whoever tossed this place wants you. And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
MAX: How's this about me?
VOGELSANG: They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery. But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
MAX: Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
VOGELSANG: Hardware's too sophisticated. It's gotta be the government. And why do I think they're looking for you?
MAX: You're crazy.
VOGELSANG: I'm you, I take that money and get outta town while you can.
VOGELSANG: Your fiance has four previous wives. His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off. Which is what you oughta do.
MAX: Bastard...
VOGELSANG: I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
MAX: You and me both.
