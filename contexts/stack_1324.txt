Does this wall have any more studs? I have a small little alcove in my wall which is perfect for a bookshelf and started stud hunting. I followed along either side of an outlet with a strong magnet until I found a screw and then moved up vertically until I marked them all. I checked around either side of this stud but failed to locate any more screws.I don't know anything about drywall. Does it seem plausible there are no other studs to be had here?I've attached a photo of the wall with the screws I narked with tape.Update:I went over it a bit more and hugged closer to the wall to find two more studs. They are 11\" apart (left side) and 28\" apart (right side). Does this seem right?Update:One of the comments helped me think more about why the studs are placed as they are. There is an air vent that passes directly through the center of the wall and the center stud is to the left of it.
