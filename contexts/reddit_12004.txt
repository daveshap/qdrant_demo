Excluded
My friend who I play games with online a bunch recently came out as queer, and despite their normally upstanding character, they started lying about how their party is full when it shows an open spot. They've also been playing games with people they met through the queer discord, which I totally support. But it feels like they are playing games with them and I'm not allowed to join because I'm straight.

I don't want to bring it up to them because it's a really fragile time, but I feel rejected. Skilled or noob, gay or straight, I would never exclude someone when I have room for more, so I don't really get it. It's not like I was demanding to be put in their voice chat lobby or get in the way. They were already getting paired with 1 random team mate from matchmaking anyways, so I feel bad that they'd literally rather play with anyone but me. I also realize how selfish this is which is why I'm venting here instead of whining to them.
