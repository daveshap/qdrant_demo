LEBOWSKI: Who the hell is he?
WALTER: I'll tell you who I am! I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
DUDE: We know the briefcase was empty, man. We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
LEBOWSKI: Well, you have your story, I have mine. I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
WALTER: AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
DUDE: You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear. All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me. You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
LEBOWSKI: Well? Aren't you?
DUDE: Well. . . yeah.
LEBOWSKI: All right, get out. Both of you.
WALTER: Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
LEBOWSKI: I said out. Now.
WALTER: Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake. A fucking goldbricker.
WALTER: This guy fucking walks. I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
LEBOWSKI: Stay away from me, mister!
