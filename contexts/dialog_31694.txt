ELIZABETH: Will you miss me?
FREDDY: Very....very!
ELIZABETH: Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
FREDDY: Oh, nice.
ELIZABETH: I hope you like large weddings.
FREDDY: Whatever makes you happy.

FREDDY: You're incorrigible!
ELIZABETH: Does that mean you love me?
FREDDY: You bet your boots it does.
