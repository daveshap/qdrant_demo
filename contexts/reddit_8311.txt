Did Republican lawmakers "obstruct President Barack Obama at every turn" to an historically "unprecedented" degree? What specific parts of his agenda have not been accomplished because of it?
With the end of Barack Obama's term in sight, in retrospectives and other articles trying to tally up the achievements and asking the question 'what will be the legacy of eight years of Obama', I keep seeing this phrase or variations thereof:

**Obama could have accomplished more, if not for the *unprecedented obstruction* by Republicans**

>There's not enough space in this column to list all the many ways the GOP obstructed Obama.

>Even when congressional Republicans obstructed everything after 2010, Obama used executive power

Elizabeth Warren even went so far as to argue that obstructionism “has created a breeding ground for new and dangerous Republican extremism” that “encourage[s] even more outrageous behavior from other Republican leaders” and “is on display in the 2016 election.” More specifically, she claimed that Republicans “have consistently blocked President Obama’s judicial nominees.”

Jesse Jackson:

>He did all of this while facing unprecedented, unrelenting partisan obstruction, with the Republican leader of the Senate opposing him at every turn, intent on making him a one-term president. In part because of that opposition, much remained undone. The stimulus would have been larger and the recovery stronger except for Republican opposition. The national minimum wage would have been raised. A national infrastructure project to rebuild America would have been launched. Progress on making America the leader of the green revolution, the next global industrial revolution, would have been greater. Guantanamo, the shameful prison in Cuba, would have been closed. The Voting Rights Act would have been revived, and much more.

>Obama White House officials blame Senate Republicans for what they characterize as an unprecedented level of obstruction in blocking the Democratic president’s court picks.

Some even specifically blamed 'white men':

>And it is clear that he has been obstructed at every turn by white men on the right who have offered temper tantrums instead of leadership. But it is also clear that the president could have done more.

Even Bill Clinton used the phrase:

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/03/21/bill-clinton-knocks-obamas-awful-legacy/82094792/

>After President Obama was elected, Republicans made it their number one goal to block him at every turn," spokesman Angel Urena said in a statement. "That unprecedented obstruction these last eight years is their legacy, and the American people should reject it by electing Hillary Clinton to build on President Obama's success so we can all grow and succeed together."

Some other mentions of the phrase I have found either vaguely referencing how it prevented his legacy, or how it's unique to the GOP ("GOP-style"), use it to explain why he 'hasn't accomplished much' etc.

But others have disputed obstruction and the unprecedented nature ascribed to it:

>For others, the culprit is the Republican Party, which obstructed Mr. Obama at every turn. And for still others, like Mr. Obama, the problem is that his administration didn’t do enough to advertise its greatness. Even if you believe there are elements of truth in these explanations, they still amount to excuses.

Or have even argued that obstruction made him *more* powerful: http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/barack-obama-gop-most-powerful-213814


**Was Obama obstructed, and if yes**:

**a)** was this to an *historically unprecedented* degree, and if not unprecedented: is this unique to *Republican* lawmakers or have Democrats done the same thing in the past?

**b)** What -specific-  parts of Obama's agenda have not been accomplished could reasonably be blamed on *Republican obstruction*?
