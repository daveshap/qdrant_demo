MACFARLANE: What are you going here? Have I not told you --
GRAY: Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
MEG: Crony indeed!
MACFARLANE: You can get out.
GRAY: I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
MACFARLANE: I've ordered nothing from you.
GRAY: This is a gift.
MACFARLANE: I take no gifts from you.
GRAY: This is a gift you'll not return.
MACFARLANE: Get out of here!
GRAY: Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
MACFARLANE: You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
