too much for too many people
hi,   does anyone else find that when they try to reach out, to anyone, from therapist to people you want a relationship with, to even just random internet strangers,  you always end up being too much,   to broken, to depressed, to nerdy etc for them to want to keep talking to you,   so you spend years of your life pretending like you live a shallow existence so you dont seem to be too much for too many people and it just leads you to be cold and alone with no one knowing who you really are and craving real human contact for someone whom im not some case study for or a good deed of the day to listen to.       is it just me who craves actual human contact or have i finally gone mad
