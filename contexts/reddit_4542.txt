My cat went missing and I need advice on how to cope.
In my previous post I mentioned my cat went missing and I can't really go look for her due to lockdown regulations in my country being so strict that I can't even walk in the street (I live in South Africa) . Right now it looks like she's not coming back but i am hoping she will.

I have struggled with anxiety and depression for years and I am finding it impossible to cope with losing my other cat. My previous cat went missing last year around the same time but at least back then I could look for her and hand out flyers. This cat was my baby and I raised her. She always comforted me when I was sad and was an overall sweetheart. It's like there's a void in my house where she used to be (if that makes sense) 

I am so depressed I can't even get out of bed. Is there anything I can do that will help me cope with this? Because I am just so heartbroken and I can see its taking a toll on the people around me as well.

Edit: My goodness I didn't think this post would blow up like it did. I just want to say thank you everyone for the support and advice. I am so grateful for all the helpful tips I got and the support. Still no sign of my cat but I will keep everyone updated.
