Is there any example of a physical theory which isn't invariant under translations? Isn't it trivial that all physical theories in spacetime are invariant under local translations?  Is there an example of a theory which isn't invariant under translations?Please, take note that I'm not talking about homogeneous metrics, i.e. isometry under translations.  I'm considering general theories of some physical laws defined on spacetime.  Physical laws should stay the same everywhere in spacetime, or else they cannot be called \"laws\".If invariance under local translations is a triviality, can it be linked to invariance under diffeomorphisms, which can be interpreted as a reformulation of general covariance?
