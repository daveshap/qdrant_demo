**6:07 PM EST**  Welcome to the megathread everyone!  I'll be live-blogging as we get results in across the country.  Right now polls have just closed in most of Indiana and Kentucky, but both states have areas in Central time which are not yet closed.  We should start seeing results around 7 or so.

**6:46 PM EST** Interesting tidbit from Indiana.  Evan Byah is running [about 8 points ahead of HRC](http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2016-election-results-coverage/?#livepress-update-21963255) in the counties which have reported results so far.

**6:49 PM EST**  [There appears to have been a shooting in Azusa, California near a polling place,](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-azusa-shooting-injuries-20161108-story.html) no indication if the shooting was related to the election in any way. 

**7:00 PM EST**  **HRC: 3 DJT: 19**  First polls closed!  Virginia, Vermont, South Carolina, Georgia, Indiana and Kentucky have polls closed.  Polls are mostly closed in Florida as well.  Networks have called VT for Clinton and IN and KY for Trump.  Georgia too *close* to call by NBC.  VA and SC too early. 

**7:02 PM EST** Rand Paul, Tim Scott, and Pat Leahy all re-elected to their Senate seats.  No call in Indiana Senate race.

**7:26 PM EST** Added a couple of live forecast models above.

**7:30 PM EST**  **HRC: 3 DJT: 24**  NC, OH, and WV closed.  No calls yet in NC or OH.  WV unsurprisingly called for Trump.

**7:32 PM EST** NBC calling OH Senate for Portman.

**7:50 PM EST**  **HRC: 3 DJT: 33** South Carolina called for Trump.

**8:00 PM EST**  **HRC: 75 DJT: 66**  Lots of states in.  Clinton gets: IL, NJ, MA, MD, CT, RI, DE, DC  Trump gets: TN, AL, OK, MS.  No call in MO, NH, ME, MI, PA

**8:03 PM EST** Tammy Duckworth unseats Mark Kirk in IL Senate race.

**8:08 PM EST** Marco Rubio re-elected.

**8:24 PM EST**  Todd Young defeats Evan Bayh, which hurts Democrats' Senate chances quite a bit.

**8:30 PM EST**  **HRC: 75 DJT: 72** Arkansas called for Trump at polls close.

**8:39 PM EST**  Networks are calling control of the House of Representatives for the Republican party.

**8:42 PM EST** This has the hallmarks of a long night.

**9:00 PM EST** **HRC: 104  DJT: 137** Lots more poll closings.  No call in MI, AZ, WI, CO, MN, NM.  Trump takes TX, KS, LA, NE (not sure about NE-2) ND, SD  Clinton takes NY.

**9:17 PM EST**  Betting markets now are at [60% Clinton, 40% Trump.](https://electionbettingodds.com/)  Down about 22% for Clinton from before results started coming in.

**9:18 PM EST**  NYT forecast has about 90% for Clinton to win the popular vote overall.  If Trump wins, he'll very likely be the second President this century to be elected despite losing the popular vote.

**9:53 PM EST** Markets are not liking the results so far.  Mexican peso [is crashing by 8%](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MXN:CUR) Dow is down [almost 500 points](http://money.cnn.com/data/premarket/) in after-market trading (about 3%).

**10:00 PM EST**  **HRC: 104 DJT: 140**  No call in IA, NV, UT, Trump takes MT.

**10:04 PM EST**  **HRC: 109 DJT: 140** New Mexico called for Clinton.  

**10:07 PM EST**  **HRC: 109 DJT: 150**  Missouri called for Trump.

**10:14 PM EST** Richard Burr projected winner in NC Senate.  That makes it very, *very* hard for Democrats to take the Senate, especially with Trump looking more likely than not to be President.

**10:20 PM EST** **HRC: 109 DJT: 168** Big call!  Ohio for Trump.  Feels like he's also going to get the Florida call soon too.

**10:26 PM EST** **HRC: 122 DJT: 168**  Virginia called for Clinton.

**10:32 PM EST** NYT forecast and betting markets saying Trump as heavy favorite to win.

**10:35 PM EST**  **HRC: 131 DJT: 168** Colorado called for Clinton.  Lots of eyes on Michigan right now.

**10:41 PM EST** Full on market panic.  Dow futures down 700 points.  [Peso is at its lowest level ever.](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-peso-idUSKBN1332MG?il=0)

**11:00 PM EST** **HRC: 190  DJT: 171** West coast polls close.  CA, HI for Clinton.  ID for Trump.  No immediate call in WA or OR

**2:06 AM EST**  John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chair, just gave a short address where he said they would not have anything more to say tonight.
