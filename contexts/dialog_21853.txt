DADDY: Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
MOTHER: Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
DADDY: Honey, he is Mr. Right.
MOTHER: Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
