MARGO: Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
LLOYD: What's your being married got to do with it?
MARGO: It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights! I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?
LLOYD: What's so funny?
KAREN: Nothing...
BILL: Nothing?
KAREN: Everything... everything's so funny...
