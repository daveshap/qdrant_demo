My acne is ruining my life
I've struggled with my acne for about 3 years now, It's been off and on since then. I've been to several dermatologist and on every kind of antibiotics, some work and it clears up for a bit but it always comes back as soon as I finish the prescription. But it's not really my appearance that bothers me because I don't care much about how I look. It's how it makes me feel, I don't ever want to go out and have to see people. I don't feel confident at all, I shy away from people unless they're an old friend. I feel anxious and frustrated all the time and at the same time I always feel like I am about to throw up. Now I have no idea how acne and nausea correlate, but I hate it. I can't stand it. It's not so much what is causing it that matters it's just how I feel about it, it bothers me on every level.
