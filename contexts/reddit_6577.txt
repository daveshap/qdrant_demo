HELP ME SURVIVE TODAY
I work at a restaurant and Iâ€™m really really sick. Been throwing up all night because of a lactose allergy. And I called in sick but my manager told me I need to find someone to cover it. Is there anyway I can miss work without getting fired just incase no one can cover my shift? (Also sorry, no flair fits this)
