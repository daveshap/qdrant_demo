SHEILA: Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
THEO: I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
SHEILA: I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
THEO: No, I'm fascinated.
SHEILA: Why were you suspended?
THEO: I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
SHEILA: So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
THEO: Well, that was plan A.
SHEILA: What's plan B?
THEO: Plan B is your dad.
SHEILA: What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
THEO: He said he'd sponsor me.
SHEILA: Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
THEO: Nothing.
SHEILA: Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
THEO: He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
SHEILA: What? Be my body guard? Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
THEO: Sheila, please.
SHEILA: Come on Theo, what about plan C?
THEO: What's plan C?
SHEILA: Plan C... ...is me.
