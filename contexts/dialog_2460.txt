BRIAN: If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
CHIEF FITZGERALD: You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
BRIAN: I want another shot, Sir.
CHIEF FITZGERALD: Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
BRIAN: If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
CHIEF FITZGERALD: -- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
BRIAN: I need another one, sir.
CHIEF FITZGERALD: Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
BRIAN: No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
CHIEF FITZGERALD: Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
BRIAN: See you Monday. Sir.
