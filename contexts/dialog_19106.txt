TRIPLETTE: What do you think of him?
REESE: Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
TRIPLETTE: You go to school together?
REESE: No, we never did that
TRIPLETTE: Oh --
REESE: We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
TRIPLETTE: Well, I really think he's got a chance.
REESE: You do?
TRIPLETTE: Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
REESE: He ain't really new.
TRIPLETTE: He is to a lot of people.
REESE: He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
TRIPLETTE: You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
REESE: Where are you from?
TRIPLETTE: Southern California.
REESE: You always live there?
TRIPLETTE: Spent time in Arizona. Why?
REESE: Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
TRIPLETTE: I know a couple.
REESE: No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
TRIPLETTE: Ah... Peter Finch.
REESE: Who?
TRIPLETTE: Peter Finch -- he's English.
REESE: I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
TRIPLETTE: Ryan O'Neal.
REESE: You really do? ~ God -- How come you know them?
TRIPLETTE: Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
REESE: I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
TRIPLETTE: Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
REESE: I'll be dammed.
OPAL: Have your children been deaf since birth?
LINNEA: Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
OPAL: When did you start singing?
LINNEA: When I was little, in church.
OPAL: Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
LINNEA: Yes, it is --
OPAL: Well, can you tell me why?
LINNEA: It just is.
OPAL: How long have you been with them?
LINNEA: About three years.
OPAL: And before?
LINNEA: Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
OPAL: Do you ever do any writing?
LINNEA: No, I don't.
OPAL: Are you a close friend of Haven's?
LINNEA: No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
OPAL: Do you like him?
LINNEA: He's a member of our congregation.
STAR: You got the money?
ALBUQUERQUE: Right here.
STAR: Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
ALBUQUERQUE: Well, that just happened that time.
STAR: Well, it better not happen again.
STAR: You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
ALBUQUERQUE: You got a real good memory, Star.
STAR: I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
ALBUQUERQUE: What do you have to buy?
STAR: Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
ALBUQUERQUE: Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
STAR: What?
ALBUQUERQUE: Grand Old Opera --
STAR: I hate that music.
ALBUQUERQUE: I know that, Star.
