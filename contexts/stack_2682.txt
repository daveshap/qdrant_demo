Save virtual fields to a layer definition file Is there a way to save virtual fields (with their expression) a layer definition file without them becoming static fields?I have about a dozen virtual fields in many tables with complex expressions, which need to be replicated in about another 20+ projects.  I would really like to find a way that I can replicate the virtual fields into the other projects without needing to recreate and copy/paste the expressions for every single virtual field.
