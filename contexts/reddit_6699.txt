S-Oil Corp Recruitment?
Hi guys, just wanted to check in here to see if anyone has come across this company or have been contacted by any of their recruiters about an offer to become a consultant for their US Investors.

It's with a company called S-oil Corporation, and they claim that this is a position that can be taken on without having to leave my current job. Is this a common thing? 

I wanted to take precautions and was curious if anyone else has run into something like this. They've contacted me via email that was listed on LinkedIn, and their HR manager's signature and information looks legitimate.
