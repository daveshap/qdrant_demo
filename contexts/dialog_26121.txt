GENERAL FACEMAN: Yes, sir. One thing, Mister President.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Yes?
GENERAL FACEMAN: Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
GENERAL FACEMAN: Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: That's a very wise deduction, General.
GENERAL FACEMAN: Thank you, sir. But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
GENERAL FACEMAN: Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
GENERAL FACEMAN: But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
PRESIDENT MUFFLEY: What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
GENERAL FACEMAN: That certainly would be a problem, sir.
