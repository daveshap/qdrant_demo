PRIEST: Hello, Mr. Parker.
MAURICE: Hello.
PRIEST: How are you feeling?
MAURICE: Confused. I'm not sure what to do now. I'm not sure what he wants for me.
PRIEST: He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
MAURICE: What do you mean?
PRIEST: I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
PRIEST: What's your shoe size?
MAURICE: What? Who are you?
