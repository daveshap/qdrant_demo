REGIS: So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
KATHY LEE: Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
REGIS: So I followed him...
KATHY LEE: You followed him?
REGIS: I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
KATHY LEE: You keep a bat under your seat?
REGIS: Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
KATHY LEE: Yes, great movie...
REGIS: I was DeNiro!
BEEFY: Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
NICKY: What can I do about it?
BEEFY: You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
NICKY: Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
BEEFY: Go get a soda out of the fridge.
NICKY: But those are my roommate's sodas...
BEEFY: But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?"
BEEFY: You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
NICKY: Release the evil?
BEEFY: I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
