Please
I've seen so much pain.

I love all of you, i've been most of you. I've cried because people won't talk to me, I've cried when they do, I've been broken up with, I've broken up and then regretted it.I've lost people, I have self harmed, I have allowed the fates to slowly knaw the string of my life, I've taken the string and almost cut it myself, etc.

If you are hurting or if you are posting about suicide, please, please know you are loved. It means a lot that you try, stay alive, I promise you its worth it.
