Does anyone else get jealous of people that don‚Äôt deal with mental illness?
*Edit: Let me mention I know everyone deals with their own problems/mental illness. I specifically mean people that may not visibly deal with it like some of us do, or handle it better.

[21F] diagnosed with GAD, Depression, ADD

This is an odd question that has plagued me off and on for a few years..... I am posting here since my anxiety has been my most dominant mental health issue in the last few years. 

Also because I think this is actually a pretty big problem (for me at least). It only breeds more hate in my heart which I don‚Äôt need when I‚Äôm already juggling so many things. 
A lot of times I find myself so shaken when I see other people, especially people I might‚Äôve gone to high school with for instance, doing so well mentally. They are able to handle so much more (perhaps they take more college classes, work more than me; etc) and still maintain a happy and overall positive attitude. Meanwhile I struggle to get out of bed most mornings and am trying to keep up my motivation enough so I don‚Äôt drop out of school again.

I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as a ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù post. I realize what my problems are and also realize I am the only one who can help them. I just want to start an open discussion to see if anyone else feels the same envy and jealously I feel sometimes when I see other people who are doing well in regards to their mental health, despite all the hardships in life.

*also I might add I am very new to Reddit. Please feel free to give me any criticism if anything seems off in my post. I‚Äôm still getting used to this platform üôÇ
