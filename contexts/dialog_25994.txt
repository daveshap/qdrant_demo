MARCUS: Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
VI: Huh?
MARCUS: I can read it to you.
VI: You mean, again?
MARCUS: Well, I changed the ending a little.
VI: Oh. What happens now?
MARCUS: Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
VI: Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
MARCUS: But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
VI: I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
MARCUS: So you don't want to hear my new ending?
VI: You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me. Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
MARCUS: You're tired of me. I can tell.
VI: Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
MARCUS: You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
VI: I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
MARCUS: Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.
