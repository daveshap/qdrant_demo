DAWN: What is it?
BRUCE: We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
DAWN: Where?
BRUCE: I don't know?
DAWN: You do, you do. You're just not saying.
BRUCE: I swear I don't know. Here's your Christmas present.
DAWN: You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
BRUCE: Please yourself.
GRACE: What is it, pet?
DAWN: He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
GRACE: Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
