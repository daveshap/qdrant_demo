WALTER: Way to go, Dude. If you will it, it is no dream.
DUDE: You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
WALTER: Theodore Herzel.
DUDE: Huh?
WALTER: State of Israel. If you will it, Dude, it is no--
DUDE: What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier. What's in the fucking carrier?
WALTER: Huh? Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
DUDE: What the fuck are you--
WALTER: I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
DUDE: You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
WALTER: What do you mean brought it bowling"? I didn't rent it shoes. I'm not buying it a fucking beer. He's not gonna take your fucking turn
DUDE: Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself. Why can't she board it?
WALTER: First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers. You can't board it. It gets upset, its hair falls out.
DUDE: Hey man--
WALTER: Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
WALTER: Smokey Huh?
WALTER: Over the line, Smokey! I'm sorry. That's a foul.
SMOKEY: Bullshit. Eight, Dude.
WALTER: Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame.
SMOKEY: Bullshit. Walter!
WALTER: This is not Nam. This is bowling. There are rules.
DUDE: Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey. So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
WALTER: This is a league game. This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
SMOKEY: Yeah, but--
WALTER: Am I wrong!?
SMOKEY: Yeah, but I wasn't over. Gimme the marker, Dude, I'm marking it an eight.
WALTER: Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
DUDE: Hey Walter--
WALTER: Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
SMOKEY: I'm not--
WALTER: A world of pain.
