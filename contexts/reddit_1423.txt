I just gave my number to a girl!
I had just gotten off the subway and had to get on the bus, I saw this cute girl and we sat together on the bus, I thought about it for a while and said to myself "if she doesn't get off on this stop, I'll give her my number" and when she didn't get off I wrote "I like your style, if you want to get to know each other here's my number" and handed it to her just before I got off the bus.Pretty sure she's not gonna text or anything but this is huge for me, my hands are still shaking and I just wanted to share! -edit : typos and grammar

\-second edit, It's been pointed out to me that what I've done could/would cause anxiety in others and what I did was wrong, I'm sad that I might have made someone feel like how I feel every day, but nevertheless I'm happy for overcoming some part of my anxiety but not about the way I went about it.

\-third edit, Thank you everyone for the nice and informative comments, I see now that people have different opinions and I shouldn't think too much about it to the point that I can't go to sleep (I should've went to sleep about 3 hours ago but couldn't)

\-fourth edit, thank you kind stranger for the gold!
