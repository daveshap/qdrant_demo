MIRA: Why are there still such headlines?
PAVEL: This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
MIRA: You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
PAVEL: In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
MIRA: You are quite sure it's secure?
PAVEL: The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
MIRA: The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
