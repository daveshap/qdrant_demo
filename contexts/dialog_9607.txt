BREWER: You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
RAMBO: No.
BREWER: I was in the brig. They gave me a deal. I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19. He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value. Seemed like a good idea at the time.
RAMBO: That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
BREWER: I've seen worse places.
RAMBO: There are no worse places.
BREWER: This place is a trip.
RAMBO: Buddhist monastery. Fifteenth century.
BREWER: Damn! Leeches.
