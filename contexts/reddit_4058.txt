PLEASE, just post pictures that reflect your current weight.
I’m overweight, so i’m not here to body shame anyone. The reason I say this is because I think that when people make it seem like they’re thinner than they are, they look worse in comparison- even if it isn’t bad. ‘Weight gain’ seems like a bigger deal than just ‘was always a little chubby’, if that’s what you’re expecting. Be honest with people- there is no good outcome with lying to people about your body. Just wait for people who appreciate you to come along, because they will!
