PAULA: Call me during the week if you get the chance.
ZACK: I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises. Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
PAULA: Sure. Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
ZACK: I know that.
