Broke up with my gf, got completely trashed at my works christmas Party and living alone for the first time...I think that’s my low point.
I moved in with my gf of 3 years into a perfect apartment. We got very lucky with that. 
Everything’s was going well. 
I found a new job, was happily living with my gf until the last couple of months everything went to shit. 

She was completely focused on her job, working late every night and was the kind of person who didn’t love to take care of other people. 
We decided to break up. 
Her parents helped her move out like a week later and I was stuck in a half empty apartment until i found a new flat. 

It was really hard focussing on work during this time. 

Now last Friday was our big Christmas party and I (a student who works part time) was one of the last guests. I have a little blackout and don’t know how I behaved during this hour. 
I remember sitting right at the end with our young CEO (37) completely trashed, too and I was so dumb to say something like „haha, I guess „name“ is done, too. Perfect“. 
I felt super good and had good conversations with everybody, still I’m really worried what happened during this hour. 
I don’t know, if I passed out, fell, danced, had a good time or bad time. 
I think I’m getting fired for the first time tomorrow and I’m freaking out. 

The only thing im hoping for, is, that since I was there until the end, it couldn’t have been that bad. If I would‘ve been really rude or misbehaved, they would’ve asked me to leave.
