MAX: You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
BRUNO: What're you talkin' about?
MAX: I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down. Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job. Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
BRUNO: That's a lotta crap.
MAX: Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient. It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
BRUNO: How come I never hearda you before?
MAX: I'm outta Portland. Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
MAX: This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
BRUNO: But the boss knows I always been loyal.
MAX: He's got exposure. He sees you starin' at fifteen to life, there's a chance you could roll over, cop a plea, who knows? Man's figured the odds...and he can't take a chance.
MAX: Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
BRUNO: What the hell are you doing?
MAX: Who's Camille?
BRUNO: None of your business.
MAX: This won't hurt. Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D. Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
