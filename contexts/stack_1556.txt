Closed current loop control without H-Bridge, PWM I am trying to find a way how to control the Voice Coil Motor (VCM) or PMSM motor with a closed current loop without the use of an H-Bridge &amp; PWM. Does anyone know how to make an analog closed current loop control without PWM and H-Bridge?I heard that the closed current loop was the last from the cascade control scheme to be digitized and I'd like to compare the performances of analog versus digital one.Thanks for any help or nudge in the right direction!
