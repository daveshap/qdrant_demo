Looking to get back into the field...
Hey everyone! Hopefully I can get some opinions or some advice from here! 

I was involved in residence life during undergrad, I was first an RA, then an apartment RA, and finally an Assistance Residence Hall Director. I was really considering going to the Oshkosh Placement Exchange my senior year, but due to some events involving my personal life, it wasn't the right time to go. 

Now, I've been out of undergrad for a little more than year, and I work in Law Enforcement (a Jail to be precise, so now I am basically an RA in a res hall with residents who are a little different). I enjoy my job, but I still have the draw to student affairs and I think that long term, getting back to working for Universities would be best for me. 

With all that being said, I am seriously considering going to OPE in 2017 and putting my name in the fight. My question is, would I still be competitive or viable? I've been out of the student affairs world for a year (will be about 2 by OPE) will that negatively or positively work for me if/when I go to OPE?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
