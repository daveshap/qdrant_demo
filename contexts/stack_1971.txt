Can a proper noun be a predicative in imperatives? I live in a city called Kobe in the western part of Japan.\u3000\u3000Perhaps some of you might have known that it was severely hit and damaged by the Great Hanshin Earthquake some 20 years ago.\u3000\u3000The\u3000City,\u3000however,\u3000recovered\u3000now\u3000and\u3000the\u3000City\u3000Authority\u3000has\u3000been\u3000running\u3000a\u3000campaign commemorating the recovery with a motto 'Be Kobe'.I have some queries about this motto from a grammatical point of view.Is the 'motto' acceptable or interpretable given a context outlined above?If it is interpretable, what can it possibly mean?Any comments are more than welcome.Ken
