Best way to learn digital marketing and get a job? (Education, training)
I  am studying Business Administration in university and I have one more  year left. I am currently doing the google online course for digital  marketing (I'm almost done with it though). What should be my next step?

I also have a little bit of experience with Graphic Design (CorelDraw, Photoshop) if that matters.
