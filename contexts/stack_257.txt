How do you copy a meeting in Outlook 2016 on Mac How do I copy a meeting in Outlook 2016 on Mac?   On PC you just use Copy/Paste.  On Mac, all the Edit commands are disabled when you select a meeting in the Outlook calendar.I spend time setting up a meeting with participants, location, attachments, categories, etc etc etc and I want to create a copy of it or a variation of it without starting from scratch.  Is this just one of those \"on our to do list\" features of Outlook on Mac?
