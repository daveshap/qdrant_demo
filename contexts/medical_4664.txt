Stress Test Dobutamine, INDICATIONS:, Atrial fibrillation, coronary disease.,STRESS TECHNIQUE:, The patient was infused with dobutamine to a maximum heart rate of 142. ECG exhibits atrial fibrillation.,IMAGE TECHNIQUE:, The patient was injected with 5.2 millicuries of thallous chloride and subsequently imaged on the gated tomographic SPECT system.,IMAGE ANALYSIS:, It should be noted that the images are limited slightly by the patient's obesity with a weight of 263 pounds. There is normal LV myocardial perfusion. The LV systolic ejection fraction is normal at 65%. There is normal global and regional wall motion.,CONCLUSIONS:,1. Basic rhythm of atrial fibrillation with no change during dobutamine stress, maximum heart rate of 142.,2. Normal LV myocardial perfusion.,3. Normal LV systolic ejection fraction of 65%.,4. Normal global and regional wall motion.cardiovascular / pulmonary, dobutamine stress test, atrial fibrillation, lv myocardial perfusion, lv systolic ejection fraction, coronary disease, dobutamine, ejection fraction, gated tomographic spect system, thallous chloride, wall motion, stress, fibrillation, atrial
