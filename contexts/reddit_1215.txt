Anybody else have anxiety attacks over mundane situations but feel totally numb over more serious situations.
Like right now I’m freaking out because my arm is in a little pain and I’m at a friends house, it’s 4:00 am and I’m cold and I don’t have a blanket but I don’t wanna wake anybody up by going out of the room to find one or wake them up directly to ask for one. I’ve been pacing back and forth in the same spot for an hour and a half, all because I’m a bit cold and my arm hurts. Same thing happened when I spilled juice on a table at school. I started hyperventilating over spilled juice. And in slightly more serious situations, I feel totally numb and i disassociate. It’s like I’m not there and my life isn’t real. I had to confront my professor about a paper I didn’t turn in yet and when I was about to talk to him, I started to feel lightheaded, my vision stated closing in, my emotions disappeared and I started to disassociate. 

I’m sorry for this somewhat long rant/DAE question that probably doesn’t even make sense. I just hate myself for being like this and I just wanted to get me feelings out.
