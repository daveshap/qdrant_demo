Do people really steal dissertation work for publishing?
Hi all, just wondering how rampant theft of dissertation work is. My ex-adviser wants me to delay publishing of my work for another year because of people stealing and publishing work in other languages before papers are out. 

I'm trying to figure out if there's any harm to me if I do delay publishing the dissertation for another year. Is there? I don't need the papers since I left academia. What else could she be scheming?
