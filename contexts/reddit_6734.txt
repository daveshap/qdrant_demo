Can I talk to another hiring manager at the same company?
So I applied for a job and got a call from a hiring manager a month ago. I felt like the interview went well. However, I didn’t hear back from the hiring manager even tho I sent her 2 follow up emails (1 week apart). 

I really believe that i’m a great fit for the position and want to make sure I take my chance to at least get to a second interview.

My question is, can I contact a different hiring manager at the same company that I found on linkedin? Would that be considered rude? Or be looked at as a negative thing? 

Thanks in advance!
