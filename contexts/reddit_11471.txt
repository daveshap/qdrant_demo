Ending life
I always keep talking myself out of it.. But i am really tired. Nothing seems to work out. Nothing. I have been unemployed for 2 years. I have been rejected by all companies national and intenational. I can't    get any clients when freelancing. I was forced to go back home to live with the parents. They said it would be better if i found a job here so they get to see me. But i don't want that but i pleased them.. Everything for them right. I rejected a fucking offer to come live with them. And they keep asking for more.. I'm spent and tired and they keep telling me that they have given me a choice whereas they did not. They think that by getting me to ask them for anything will replace the need i have for making a solo life for myself. I just wanted to be alone make my own decisions.. Have fun, go out maybe date. But here with them.. Everytime i want to go out i haveto ask for money which is embarrassing for me to do specially at age 25. And they keep asking a shiload of questions, and if i come home at 10pm they flip. This is the part they don't get, that i am NOT a baby. If something happens let it happen it does not concern them anymore. Otherwise why did they give birth to me. I did not ask for it nor did i ask to live.
I am balancing them on one side and fighting hard to stay alive. And i am tired. I just want it to stop.
