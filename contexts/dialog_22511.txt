BOOTH: What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
BOOTH: Nothing happened?
SALLY: Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well. It's over.
BOOTH: Like hell it's over. You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
SALLY: He's not, he's...
BOOTH: That son of a bitch.
SALLY: Booth. Don't. It's nothing. It's not worth it. Remember what happened the last time?
SALLY: Let's not get into this again. I know him. If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
BOOTH: And I'd take it out on him.
SALLY: And I'd end up a widow in two ways. Let's forget it. I'll just be a little more careful next time.
BOOTH: There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
