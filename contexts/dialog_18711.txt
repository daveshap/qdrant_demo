O'CONNELL: How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
BENI: I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
O'CONNELL: Altar boys?
BENI: Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
