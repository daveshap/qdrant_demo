Edit large geojson data sets in Openlayers I'd like to edit a rather large collection (several MB of polygons and lines) with OpenLayers. What's the best way working with large data sets, considering client side (rendering) performance and server side scalability? We're currently using Geoserver on the backend side, though in order to enable scalable editing capabilities we're also looking into other directions.EDITI should add a bit more background. I expect lots of geometries, even when zoomed in. Consider very large venues where there are hundreds of stands / booths, besides also other indoor (floors and others) and outdoor (building) geometries.
