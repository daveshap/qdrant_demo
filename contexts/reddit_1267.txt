Slow Down. You are getting more than enough air.
You are getting enough oxygen. Slow down your breathing. Oxygen is all around you, it is infinite, there is an abundance of it. You are in no danger of running out of it.

One of the most insidious symptoms of anxiety attacks is that you convince yourself you aren't getting enough oxygen. Then you make it true by hyperventilating.

I wanted to write this to help anyone going through what I go through on a near-daily basis, convincing myself I need more air, need to breathe harder, that I'm not getting enough oxygen.

Breathe only enough to power your body in the present moment. Don't worry if you will need more air later; you can - and will - get that later. A small breath is enough for now.

Your body is in fight or flight mode right now. It's hoarding oxygen to try and deal with imminent danger. It thinks you need a burst of energy to fight something, or sprint away. Your body is being silly, tricked by your mind. **There is no physical danger; you are safe and you know it.**

You control your body, just like you control your mind. Both of them are tools you have at your disposal. Neither controls the other, neither controls you. Right now your mind is demanding more oxygen from your body, as if it knows better. How *dare* it.

Focus on your body instead. Feel your arms, legs, your muscles. Are they running out of oxygen? No, they aren't. Right now, your heart is pounding because you are breathing too hard. There's too much oxygen, not enough carbon dioxide, you are hyperventilating and your heart is working doubletime to deal with all of that.

Your body knows exactly how much oxygen it needs. Don't be breathing until your mind tells you "that's enough." Breathe only until your actual body is content.

Try this if you are going through a panic attack.

On your next exhale, pause for a while before your next inhale. This will take some willpower. It will feel wrong, like you are suffocating, depriving your body of what it desperately needs. That is a lie. Do it anyways. You may start to feel a sensation in your head, almost like excess blood is draining from it. Whatever it is, don't run from it. That's the *calm* you are looking for. That's the carbon dioxide you've been depriving yourself of, and the real thing your body desperately needs.

Take in relaxed inhales. Your lungs do not need to be at full capacity. You may have to fight your mind on this. Just remember **you are getting enough air**. Your mind is being silly, you need to whip it into shape. Some things, like breathing, must be surrendered to your body. Make sure you relax when you exhale, do not contort your abs to squeeze out all the air in you.

Remember that inhaling is the only part of breathing that takes any energy. Exhaling is simply letting go.
