[HELP] Let go from my job due to 'budget constraints' - 2 months later the company wants me back!
So in early January, I was let go from my training position (a few weeks before my pay was legally due to rise), they used the typical 'we don't have the budget' excuse, which I didn't buy for a second. It was a job I worked my ass off in and got really good at, the entire team was dependant on me covering their shifts so they could travel and visit clients. Because it was an intern type position, It took me a 9-12 months before I really started to gain the knowledge and call the role my own, the company didn't really put a big effort into training me - I self taught the functions of the software myself. 

So they threw away all the experience I gained and will now have to train another person from scratch now that they've gotten rid of me. This was all probably because I would have cost them a little bit more, so they'd rather bring in a new trainee instead of paying me a bit more. They probably could afford it, but saw the opportunity to save a quick buck.

A week or two later when looking for a new job, I see my old position being advertised on a job board, the closing gate kept on getting extended and extended by a few weeks every time. I can only presume this is because they couldn't get to replace me with.

Fastforward to yesterday, I get an email from my old boss - saying they want me back and are willing to offer me the full time job that I didn't get last time. Pay is okayish but isn't the best, the company isn't that big and so doesn't really pay people that well in general.

Thoughts? I've been applying for two months now for equivalent but much higher paying trainee jobs that I'm qualified for, some with huge companies. Should I accept the offer or keep plugging away?

**Tl;DR: Company let me go, thinking they could cheaply replace me with another trainee. That plan appears to have failed, and now they want me back full time.**
