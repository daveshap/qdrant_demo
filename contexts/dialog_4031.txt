DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy. Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more. But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
JEFFREY: I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
JEFFREY: It must be great.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: And it's horrible too. I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
JEFFREY: Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
MRS. WILLIAMS: Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY: Say goodnight" to Sandy."
