MACFARLANE: Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
GRAY: But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
MACFARLANE: But why, Gray? Why?
GRAY: Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
MACFARLANE: A pleasure to torment me?
GRAY: No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
