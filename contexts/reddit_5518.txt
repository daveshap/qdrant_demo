Math Major Recently Graduated, Should I get an online MBA or an online MS in Analytics?
I just got my math degree.  3.13 GPA (I know, not too great) from UMD.  

I'm about $18,000 in school debt.  I have a job lined up as a financial analyst in Los Angeles.  I want to get a graduate degree to give myself more credibility and marketability.  Should I get an online MBA or an online MS in Analytics? Should I scrap the notion of even getting a graduate degree?  I'm 28 yr old woman and have a degree in music and went back to school for math because I thought it could be more lucrative.  Music degree was free ride.  Help.
