Do you regularly wish you had a new job?
I don’t hate my job. I generally enjoy it, I know I’m good at it and am well regarded. But regularly (weekly I’d say) I contemplate finding something else. I was wondering if this is common- how many people spend a lot of time mulling over the other things they could be doing? I stay because I don’t hate it, and the conditions are excellent which I know I shouldn’t take for granted. I’m just wondering if my constant daydreaming about something else is a sign I should *do* something else, or is it a normal part of a 20 plus year career. Thanks for any perspective you might feel happy to share!
