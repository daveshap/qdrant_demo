So today I did the impossible.
Hey I guess. Just for background information I am 13 and have spastic diplegia. Today I got 35 steps unaided (I walk full time with crutches). This is something I wouldn’t have believed possible as I was told from an early age I may never speak, walk or ride a bike. Now I can do all three and I just wanted to share. I’ve been working on this for years - the therapy and practice and surgeries have finally started to pay off! For anyone asking for proof- here! 
Thank you all so much for your support! As someone that genuinely suffers from anxiety seeing you all comment really helps!
