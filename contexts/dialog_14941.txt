GRANT: After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
AMANDA: He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
GRANT: No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
PAUL: Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
GRANT: You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
