I got a job!
I have lived with crippling anxiety since I was 17 (I am now 22).
This caused me to become so ill I couldn’t even leave my house without being sick, I was put on medication when I was 19 which has helped me immensely
I never thought I would have a job but here I am
It feels so surreal 
I’m proud of myself :)
