JOE: When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
PARRISH: What do you mean?
JOE: You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
PARRISH: I guess so.
JOE: So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
PARRISH: Of course.
JOE: So you've grasped the idea. Con- gratulations. Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
PARRISH: Joe --?
JOE: Yes, Bill.
PARRISH: How about giving a guy a break?
JOE: Make an exception?
PARRISH: There's one to every rule.
JOE: Not this.
PARRISH: -- I don't deserve this. I'm still young, this is not my time --
JOE: That's what everybody says.
PARRISH: I'm not everybody.
JOE: That's what everybody says.
PARRISH: I want to live.
JOE: I understand.
PARRISH: What's it like?
JOE: What do you mean?
PARRISH: What's it like where I'm going?
JOE: Can you keep a secret?
PARRISH: Yes.
JOE: So can I.
