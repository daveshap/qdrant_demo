CARDENAS: What are you saying, Henry? That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
MCCURDY: Yes.
CARDENAS: What can we prove?
MCCURDY: We know Marsh had a head cold. We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand. The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time. He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
CARDENAS: Any prints on the nasal spray?
