BUGGIN' OUT: Yo!
CLIFTON: Yes?
BUGGIN' OUT: You almost knocked me down. The word is excuse me.""
CLIFTON: Excuse me. I'm very sorry.
BUGGIN' OUT: Not only did you knock me down, you stepped on my new white Air Jordans that I just bought and that's all you can say, Excuse me?""
BUGGIN' OUT: I'll fuck you up quick two times.
BUGGIN' OUT: Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block? Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
CLIFTON: I own a brownstone on this block.
BUGGIN' OUT: Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
BUGGIN' OUT: What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for? Motherfuck gentrification.
CLIFTON: I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
