ASTRID: You're not upset that I brought the dog?
SALLY: Would it make a difference?
ASTRID: Anouk isn't like a dog, really. More like a small person. So is there anyone here for me? No one looks new. Who's that?
SALLY: You don't want that. It's married and it's the neighbor.
ASTRID: Oh I think he's cute. How's the marriage part working out?
SALLY: You're fucking desperate.
ASTRID: Like you didn't know. Who invited the bimbo?
SALLY: One guess.
