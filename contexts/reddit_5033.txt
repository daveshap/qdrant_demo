My manager hasn’t given me any shifts despite making myself available?
Feels bad man because I made myself available June and July month. Just checked to see if I got any hours around June and there  wasn’t any.  I also haven’t worked in like 2-3 months due to a lot of school work which my manager knows about.  I always work a lot in the summertime so I really wanted shifts.  My manager has hired lots of new employees as well. What can I do?
