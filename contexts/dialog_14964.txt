GUY LAB PARTNER: Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
GIRL LAB PARTNER: No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
GUY LAB PARTNER: You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
GIRL LAB PARTNER: Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
GUY LAB PARTNER: What? My eyes are not lying!
GIRL LAB PARTNER: Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
