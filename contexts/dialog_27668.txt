LYDIA: She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
MITCH: Yes, very.
LYDIA: And certainly pretty.
MITCH: Yes.
LYDIA: How long have you known her?
MITCH: I told you. We met yesterday.
LYDIA: In a bird shop.
MITCH: Yes.
LYDIA: She was selling birds.
MITCH: No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
LYDIA: But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
MITCH: Mother, where did you go to law school?
LYDIA: Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that. She's very rich, isn't she?
MITCH: I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
LYDIA: You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
MITCH: I know, Mother.
LYDIA: She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
MITCH: Yes, Mother.
LYDIA: Perhaps I'm old-fashioned. I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
MITCH: I know, Mother.
LYDIA: It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
MITCH: Mother?
LYDIA: Yes?
MITCH: I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
LYDIA: Well... So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
MITCH: I know exactly what I want, Mother.
MITCH: You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
MELANIE: Oh, yes.
MELANIE: Will I be seeing you again?
MELANIE: San Francisco's a long way from here.
MITCH: I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you. Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
MELANIE: How does Mother know what I like to do?
MITCH: I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
MELANIE: Oh. That. Rome.
MITCH: Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
MELANIE: In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
MELANIE: Without any clothes on?
MELANIE: With all my clothes on! The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper. Anything they said...
MITCH: You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
MELANIE: I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
MITCH: The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
MELANIE: Yes, but...
MITCH: ...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
MELANIE: Yes.
MITCH: ...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
MELANIE: Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
MITCH: Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
MELANIE: No. At least, I didn't until I came up here.
MITCH: So you didn't go to school together.
MELANIE: No.
MITCH: And you didn't come up here to see her.
MELANIE: No.
MITCH: You were lying.
MELANIE: Yes, I was lying.
MITCH: Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
MELANIE: I wrote the letter.
MITCH: What did it say?
MELANIE: It said, Dear Mr. Brenner
MITCH: But you tore it up.
MELANIE: Yes.
MITCH: Why?
MELANIE: Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
MITCH: Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
MELANIE: I told you what happened in Rome!
MITCH: Do you expect me to believe...?
MELANIE: I don't give a damn what you believe!
MITCH: I'd still like to see you.
MELANIE: Why?
MITCH: I think it could be fun.
MELANIE: That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
MITCH: It is for me.
MELANIE: But not for me.
MITCH: What do you want ?
MELANIE: I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
ANNIE: Miss Daniels? Is that you?
MELANIE: Yes.
ANNIE: Hi. Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
MELANIE: No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
ANNIE: Would you like some brandy?
MELANIE: If you have some, I'd...
ANNIE: I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
MELANIE: No, thank you. Won't you call me Melanie?
ANNIE: All right.
MELANIE: Thank you.
ANNIE: It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
