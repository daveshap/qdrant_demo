ROCKY: Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
ADRIAN: By accident?
CLEANER: Here -- Three minutes.
ROCKY: Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
ROCKY: What's funny?
ADRIAN: My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
