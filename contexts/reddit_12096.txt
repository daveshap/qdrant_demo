I don't like to say the word "love".
For years. Why? peoples families: they have many conditions, for example, if they "love their child" some families will hurt their children (violently, sometimes) if they did something they disliked. Relationships; Some people will reject your caring and compassion if you don't have sex with them, sex is called "making love" (if love is caring why does there need to be sex?), some people can say "I love you" and then end up doing the worst things to you (such as destroying a PS3 if someone isn't paying attention to them but rather video games, or killing you for who-knows-what, beating you, etc.) or even cheat on you. Or just eventually stop liking you.

I like someone a whole lot right now but just can't say "I love them" although I pretty much have the feelings as what the word "love" is described. A friend told me that if someone loves you and you can't say that back, they will eventually stop. 

Although I truly really like this person.
