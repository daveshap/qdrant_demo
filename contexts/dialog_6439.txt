DRUMLIN: You aren't staying?
ELLIE: This... seemed best.
DRUMLIN: Right. Well.
ELLIE: Good luck, David.
DRUMLIN: Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race. That I would have told the President straight out: Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together. That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this. And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have. But that's not who I am. I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given... You do what you have to do. And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power. And it isn't fair...
ELLIE: What would you have me say, David?
DRUMLIN: Nothing. I guess I just wanted to thank you.
ELLIE: Thank you?
DRUMLIN: For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
