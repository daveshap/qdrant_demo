NIXON: My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John. Tuberculosis got him.
MITCHELL: It wasn't your fault. The soldiers were just kids, too. They panicked.

MITCHELL: You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
NIXON: It broke my heart when Harold died.
MITCHELL: That was a long time ago.
