VAUGHAN: Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
KARL: I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
VAUGHAN: Okay.
KARL: This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
VAUGHAN: What's wrong? Is everything okay?
KARL: That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
VAUGHAN: Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
KARL: Naw, not yet. I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
VAUGHAN: What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
KARL: I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy. You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades. That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
DOYLE: Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em? I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
KARL: How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
DOYLE: Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
KARL: What numbers do you punch?
DOYLE: I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV. What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
KARL: I aim to kill you with it.
