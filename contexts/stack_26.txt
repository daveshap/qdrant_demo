Can I download free apps without a payment method? I just downloaded the newest iOS version, which I don't know what it is, and I can't download free apps now. I used to be able to download free apps, but now apple requires a credit card to download apps even if the apps are free.I don't know what version of iOS I am using, nor what type I was using earlier. Nor do I know what type of iPhone I am using other than that it is an iPhone of some sort. I don't know how to find out this information either.
