GRADY: Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
JESSE: I'm sorry...
GRADY: What are you doing here?
JESSE: You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
GRADY: Are you nuts or something?
JESSE: Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening. It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
