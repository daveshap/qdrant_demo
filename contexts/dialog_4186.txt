JEFFREY: These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Okay.
JEFFREY: Anything you can tell me?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: The criminals are winning.
JEFFREY: Is that why you say it's horrible?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Yes.
JEFFREY: I guess you've seen some bad things.
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
JEFFREY: Why do you do it?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
JEFFREY: Yeah. I get it.
JEFFREY: What is this? What color is it?
DETECTIVE WILLIAMS: Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
