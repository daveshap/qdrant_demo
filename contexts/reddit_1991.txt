Just got into Harvard!!!
FOLKS. I just got a call from Harvard.

I’m in!!!!

I was called at 3:24 ET, I live in Indiana.

I was deferred EA and then waitlisted, but the office just called me from a 617 area code and said I’ve been offered a spot in the class of 2023, and that I’ll receive official portal confirmation + financial aid tomorrow.

Ahh!!
