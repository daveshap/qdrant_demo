ESCOBAR: You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
GITTES: I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
ESCOBAR: I want the rest of the pictures.
GITTES: What pictures?
ESCOBAR: This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
GITTES: Yeah?
ESCOBAR: Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
GITTES: I heard it was an accident.
ESCOBAR: C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
ESCOBAR: You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
GITTES: You accusing me of extortion?
ESCOBAR: Absolutely.
GITTES: I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
ESCOBAR: Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
GITTES: Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
ESCOBAR: I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
GITTES: Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
GITTES: Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
ESCOBAR: And why's that?
GITTES: He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
ESCOBAR: What are you talking about?
GITTES: C'mon I'll show you.
