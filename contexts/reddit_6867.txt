In a temporary lay off situation is it advisable to update my LinkedIN to state I am Open to New Opportunities?
I’ve been “temporarily laid off” by the company I worked for. Both my manager and the HR person kept reiterating to me to keep in mind that this lay off is considered temporary, they want to bring me back and don’t want to see me move on. Every time I kept saying things like well that’s too bad I loved working with this company, the assured me that they want to bring me back. 

However there is no definite date of rehire which in my mind translates to no guarantee whatsoever. For example, what if the company struggles so bad it goes under or what if they can no longer sell the types of projects I worked on to our clients? 

I’d love to wait and get rehired HOWEVER the other part of me would love to be employed and working. 

If I updated my LinkedIN status to “Seeking New Opportunities.” They will see if, Will this make them not hire me back or make them have a negative opinion of me? 

I’ve never been “temporarily laid off” off before.
