biased teachers
my math teacher is my assistant coach of my basketball team sometimes and i’m getting an I (incomplete) in his class. He’s never told me i couldn’t play basketball??? He’s super biased and only likes athletic kids but i’m still failing his class? every time i ask for help he says “that’s ur problem,” should i talk to him about it? how do i?
