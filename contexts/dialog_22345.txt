TYBALT: What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
CAPULET: Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
TYBALT: Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
CAPULET: Young Romeo is it?
TYBALT: 'Tis he.
CAPULET: Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
TYBALT: I'll not endure him.
CAPULET: He shall be endured
TYBALT: Uncle, 'tis a shame.
CAPULET: Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
ROMEO: Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
ROMEO: If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
JULIET: Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
ROMEO: Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
JULIET: Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
ROMEO: Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
JULIET: Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
ROMEO: Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
JULIET: Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
ROMEO: Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
JULIET: You kiss by the book.
NURSE: Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
ROMEO: Is she a Capulet?
NURSE: His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
MERCUTIO: Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
ROMEO: Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
