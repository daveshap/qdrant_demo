Has anyone else been anxious since they were a kid?
Ever since I was young, I've always been super anxious about everything. There's always been a whole host of things that made me anxious to the point where I'd avoid doing so much, even if I wanted to do whatever I was avoiding. I didn't even realise that it was a problem until I got into my teens and realised how much my anxiety stopped me from enjoying my life. 

From what I've read it seems like most people didn't always experience anxiety (correct me if I'm wrong), but as far back as I can remember I've always been that way. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else has always experienced some form of anxiety since they were very young as well.

Edit: Reading through all the replies, it seems that it's a lot more common than I was expecting. Main reason I was curious was because went to see someone about my anxiety problems, he seemed confused when I told him that I'd always remembered being anxious and it wasn't something that started happening when I was older.
