DADDY: Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
BUDDY: Yeah, he's still up there.
DADDY: What's taking the rascal so long?
MOTHER: Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
DADDY: I don't care where the polecat studied.
MOTHER: Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit. Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
BUDDY: Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
MOTHER: Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble -- Brother, you ought to hear this.
BUDDY: I'll be right back.
