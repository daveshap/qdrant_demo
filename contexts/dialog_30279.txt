GALVIN: Do you think it's my fault?
LAURA: Isn't there something you...
GALVIN: That's not the question. It's over. Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
LAURA: You're talking like a drunk.
GALVIN: That's what I am.
LAURA: And it's over...?
GALVIN: Yes.
LAURA: Well, then what are you doing here?
GALVIN: I...do you want me to leave?
LAURA: You do what you want. You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
GALVIN: I...
LAURA: You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it? I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
GALVIN: Who told you that?
LAURA: You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
GALVIN: And what makes you so tough?
LAURA: Maybe I'll tell you later.
GALVIN: Is there going to be a later...?
LAURA: Not if you don't grow up...
GALVIN: If I don't 'grow up...'
LAURA: You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
GALVIN: You, you don't under...
LAURA: Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
GALVIN: It's over!
LAURA: What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
GALVIN: What is that to you...?
LAURA: What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
