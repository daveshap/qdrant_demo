JEFFREY: Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
SANDY: No Jeffrey!!
JEFFREY: Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
