Why you need to let poor people buy coffee in peace
I somehow found myself in another "Why don't you just cut unnecessary spending?" spiral, so I've decided to do some math that I and anyone else can copy and paste as needed.

&#x200B;

Why don't you stop buying Starbucks/Netflix/beer/movie tickets/whatever occasional purchase you use to feel a little better? Won't that fix your financial situation? Why is the snack/trinket/experience worth more?

Let me lead with this: Money has no intrinsic value. You avoid spending money on one thing so that you can spend it on another. That's the reason. You can choose to not spend as much on one thing so that you can pay for something else. If the savings on one thing are not enough to purchase the other thing, it makes no sense to not get the enjoyable thing that you can afford.

The example:

Let's say you want to buy a car. You can get a nice, new car for $25k. We're ignoring trade in value or savings for a down payment in these calculations because poor people don't tend to have significant equity \[update: not because you are poor in this scenario but because we're going to work from zero with our numbers\]. We're starting from the bottom. The average interest rate for a new car loan in the US is 4.21%. This would make your payments $463/month.

Now, let's say that you don't want to get that car loan. You want to avoid that pesky interest rate. It just doesn't make financial sense, right? Instead you opt to ride public transit until you can save up enough for the car. The average cost of a transit pass in the US is $67/month. That's $396 less than the car payment, so that's $396/month out of your transportation budget that you can tuck away.

It will take you **over five years to afford that car**.

That is five years of only going where the buses run while the buses are running. That is five years of dealing with other people's smells and sounds. That is five years of walking to and from transit stops.

This is a best case scenario. What if you don't live in a city with adequate transit? What if it's more expensive in your city? What if you work overnight, and the buses don't go in the direction you need at the times you need them to? What if a drunk person pukes or pees on you? Because that happens.

Given the choice, many of us would just pay the extra to commute in clean privacy for those five years. It's worth it to be able to go where you want when you want. The benefits would outweigh the costs, as evidenced by the number of Americans with auto loans.

**The only other way to compress that timeline is to be able to increase your transportation budget.**

This is why broke people buy lattes instead of investing. It's because if you bought a frappuccino every day, it would take **nine and a half years** to spend the equivalent of a 7% down payment on a $250k house. It would take **almost four years** even for a $100k house.

**You cannot nickel and dime your way out of poverty.**

If you wouldn't sit in someone else's urine stains for five years, leave the poor person buying an avocado alone.

Edit:  Yikes. Where do I begin?

I thought that the first paragraph explained my purpose clearly enough, but this is a scenario meant to explain a certain type of opportunity cost to someone living above a certain standard. Imaginary scenario guy is obviously not that hard up. I'm thinking it was a certain line that confused people, and I've edited it accordingly.

The daily frappuccino example is a theoretical maximum pulled from a common trope of "financial advice" columns. No broke person is buying one every day, but even if they were, that's the absolute most they could save. No, that number isn't nothing, but that's an imaginary peak. The point is that it's not the coffee that's keeping people out of escrow.

But look what people did.

They fought tooth and nail to explain why an imaginary person with the space in their budget should not buy something they want. I've been accused of making up interest rates, never having ridden a bus, never having seen a homeless person \[projection much?\], etc. All my numbers were pulled from national averages compiled in the last year. Some of the numbers were surprising enough to be in headlines. The pee scenario? Pulled from a true story. The struggles of public transit? From my own experience in my city. I've been to cities with beautiful transit that could easily replace a car, but for myself and many other Americans that's just not a realistic situation.

I was just trying to give people a tool to make a point. That point is that it's not anyone's business to police how somebody else makes their way through a long term problem. (And for a lot of people poverty isn't long term but actually permanent. It's just a fact that many people die in poverty. I'm not being pessimistic. It's a statistic.)

If I might get something in ten years, it's up to me to decide whether that's worth chipping away at the quality of the days in between. It's not anyone else's job to pass judgement on that decision. Analysis of an opportunity cost is very personal. Let people live.
