Uber. Hear me out. I'm serious.
So I tried this before and people totally misunderstood and it got removed. So I'll try to be more specific.

If you own a car that qualifies for uber, sign up. You get a ton of discounts on tires and car maintenance as long as you complete one trip. 

Once you are a registered driver, if you ever hit a patch where you are broke and hungry, or short on rent or whatever, you can turn the app on, and have some cash in your bank account one min after finishing a trip. It's a godsend if you have a quarter tank of gas and no money. You can turn that quarter tank of gas into like $130 after fuel cost in around 8 hours. 

This is by no means a viable way to earn a living full time, but if your family is going to go to sleep for dinner, or the landlord is kicking you out or you overdrafted your bank account or whatever has happened it can get you through. It paid my mortgage last month. 

Many people will tell horror stories about a friend of a friend who got screwed Or whatever. Remember, uber insures your passenger, not your car, and not if you are intoxicated in any way. 

It took me 10 days to get my background check back, so if you get approved now, you have a fallback paycheck just in case. 

For me right now, having a bit of income from driving is giving me the chance to find the right new job, not just the first one.

Obligatory not a corporate shill, literally any job that pays $12 an hour pays more than uber does after gas, oil changes, and car maintenance. But when the doodoo hits the fan, it can prevent the poo pile from snowballing.
