What forces are responsible for the continued protests seen in Iraq?
Iraq has had continuous anti-government protests since the Arab Spring ([2011](https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/22/iraq-intensifying-crackdown-free-speech-protests), [2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20110826043422/http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-jrtn-movement-and-iraq%E2%80%99s-next-insurgency), [2015](http://studies.aljazeera.net/en/reports/2015/08/20158307585163273.html) to name a few). Most recently, this week's protest has led to [more than 100 people killed and thousands injured.](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/06/767711133/more-than-100-killed-and-thousands-injured-in-anti-government-protests-in-iraq) with some sources reporting that [live ammunition is being used on protestors](https://www.businessinsider.com/video-appears-to-show-rocket-flies-past-iraq-youtuber-protests-2019-10).
 

Iraqis have long stated protests occur due to [corruption within their government, unemployment, and a lack of access to utilities (electricity, water)](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49960677) while state governments have been quick to put the blame on other parties, such as Iran's government blaming [western influencers](https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iraq-protests-are-real-war-with-US-Khamenei-IRGC-representative-603990) and Iraq's government blaming ['malicious hands'](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/06/iraq-government-pledges-to-investigate-live-firing-on-protesters) outside of their military.

Is there any merit to the idea that forces outside of Iraq's own government have created unrest among Iraqi citizens, or is there a deeper root cause of public unrest?
