ORDELL: You told em? You told em it's me?
JACKIE: They already know it's you.
ORDELL: Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
JACKIE: Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
ORDELL: Didja tell 'em anything else?
JACKIE: I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
ORDELL: You told them that?
JACKIE: It's true, isn't it?
ORDELL: What the fuck's that got to do with it?
JACKIE: They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
ORDELL: What did they say?
