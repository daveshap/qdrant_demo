This is so bad
My boyfriend who is 37 admitted to my 17 year old daughter that he was attracted to her. My daughter who was molested by her stepfather after he raised her from a baby is uncomfortable and upset at this comment. She was seeing my boyfriend as a father figure. He apologized and and said that although he admitted that she is attractive he would never act on those thoughts. He is sorry he ever mentioned it and everything is awkward. He said he would help us get our own apartment and that he loves me but he also feels bad that he made everyone feel uncomfortable. I asked my daughter if she wanted to move and she is confused and just wants to think. 

I don't know how I feel either. I understand that he is sorry and embarrassed. And I would do anything to keep my daughter from feeling that she can't trust him. 

I love them both. I'm praying that we can all talks and get passed this but I also know there is a good chance that we may be breaking up and going our own ways. 

Is there a way back to happiness from here or should I just walk away from all of this. My daughter will turn 18 and leave for her own life in a few months. But can I be happy with a man who says he thinks she is attractive because she reminds him of a 20 year younger me.  

Seriously confused
