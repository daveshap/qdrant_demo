CRAIG: Don't you want to know what happened to me?
MAXINE: No.
CRAIG: This is important!
MAXINE: It better be.
CRAIG: There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
MAXINE: Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
CRAIG: He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
MAXINE: What's he been in?
CRAIG: Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
MAXINE: Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
CRAIG: Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
MAXINE: Good. We'll sell tickets.
CRAIG: Tickets to Malkovich?
MAXINE: Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
CRAIG: But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
MAXINE: Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
CRAIG: You wanted to be partners with me?
MAXINE: Sure. It'd be fun.
CRAIG: Really? But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
MAXINE: I'll protect you, Dollface.
