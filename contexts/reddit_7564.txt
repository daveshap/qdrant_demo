What do people think about MSc Finance (Part-Time) @ London School of Economics?
I have 7 years of experience in a related field. Don't have an MSc and my BSc is in an unrelated field. In addition to the question in the title, a few more granular questions:

1. I feel that it's better than CFA purely because there are many CFAs and not that many people with MSc from similar calibre institutions. There are of course other reasons. Any opinions?
2. How does LSE compare to LBS in general? How do their MSc Finance (Part-Time) programmes compare?
3. How LSE is viewed in the US?
4. What other part-time masters programmes are better or comparable to this one?
