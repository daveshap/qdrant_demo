CARTER: This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment. Make him think you don't trust him.
LAFONTAINE: I don't trust anybody. Especially first time deals.
CARTER: I oughta pat your ass down. Make sure you're not a cop.
LAFONTAINE: Nobody touches me.
CARTER: Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you. That does nothin' for me. No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
