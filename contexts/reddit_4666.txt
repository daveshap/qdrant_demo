My Spirit broke for the first time
I found myself stuck in a deep dark hole covered with the thought that everything was fine.

Someone pulled me out of that hole, and i realized how bad I was before I met her. I never thought i was hurting that much.

But she gave me things to be happy about, and for the first time in a long time i felt real happiness. Not the fake “your fine” my brain tells me everyday, true happiness. 

Turns out it was a lie as well.
She pulled me out, just to spit on my face and throw me back down.

Now im doing something i’ve never done, listen to sad music and think about my situation. 

Then when i realized how fucking hopeless i was i felt my spirit split in two. One side desperately trying to pull itself back together, while the other wants nothing but death.

I feel like a lot of other people feel this way, but i seriously don’t know what to do with myself.

I don’t expect anyone to respond to this, or even read this far. But i need something to distract myself from the pain.
