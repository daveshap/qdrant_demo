How to Organize Coursework in a SA Degree
Hi folks! I just recently enrolled in my first semester of graduate school courses and I’m ecstatic. These don’t start until August obviously, but I wanted to get a head start as to how to organize myself for graduate level coursework.

To be honest, it took me a few years in undergrad to get a system down that worked for me. I realized (a little bit later than I would have hoped) that writing everything down is the best way for me to go about studying.

How do y’all take notes for these courses in lecture and for readings? What suggestions do you have organization wise that will help me do my best? What was the biggest difference from undergrad to grad school?

I want to earn a PhD in the field, so getting a 4.0 to secure funding is very high on my list. I’m really embarrassed about my undergrad GPA and would love to redeem myself during grad school. Thank you!
