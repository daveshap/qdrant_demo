MOLLY: Peter... What do you think you're doing?
RIVIERA: Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
MOLLY: Who?
RIVIERA: Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
MOLLY: Like what?
RIVIERA: Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
