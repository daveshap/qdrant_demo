Boss is trying to make us go to the office and take our desktops home. Is this worth fighting over?
I work for a small business (less than 15 people in the office) and we've all been working from home since mid-March. Since then we've been using a VPN to access any work files. This morning our boss sends an email saying we need to go to the office and pick up our monitors and CPUs from our office and take them home to continue working on them instead of using our personal computers.

I live in a very small apartment with my immunocompromised grandmother and I do not like to go outside unless its for essential items. I do not want to risk bringing COVID-19 home, and I also barely have any room for a desktop monitor and CPU (which is why I only have a laptop). Not to mention any cords or wires that may be needed for the computer to function properly at home.

I truly do not want to go through that effort, especially when I'm only working 12 hours a week now due to COVID-19 and will have to lose desk space for other work I will need to do. I have a 1099 job that requires me to physically write notes, and any desk space I have will be gone with the monitor and keyboard  there.

I genuinely don't know what to do. Is this a battle I should just avoid and just get the desktop? I'm grateful to even still have this job, and especially 2 during this time but I feel like I'm risking/sacrificing more for this job that what it offers (less space, exposure to COVID-19, etc., less hours) when there has been no issues working from home so far.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!
