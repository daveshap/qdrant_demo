First Kiss
Okay so i just had my first kiss with my first ever boyfriend. 

Popular media and culture has made me believe that it was gonna be this great magical moment and that im gonna feel amazing. But tbvh, it was just kinda underwhelming. It felt literally like pressing my face up against his face. That was it. No spark, no tingles. 

I do like him very much though. Just to be clear.

Is this normal?
