ROPER: This baseball player you're going out with... He's no good for you.
RONNIE: Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
ROPER: I worship you.
RONNIE: You worship yourself.
ROPER: Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
RONNIE: Greg.
ROPER: Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
RONNIE: You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
ROPER: Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
ROPER: Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
RONNIE: I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
ROPER: This Greg is really getting in my way.
ROPER: Please. I'm begging you.
RONNIE: Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
