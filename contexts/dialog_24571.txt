JERRY: Here you are, Sugar.
SUGAR: A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
JERRY: You betcha.
JOE: Wait a minute, Daphne. You haven't got a bathing suit.
SUGAR: She doesn't need one. I don't have one either.
JERRY: See? She doesn't have one either - You don't?
SUGAR: We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
