How realistic is a career in programming from being self-taught?
Live in UK.

- Early 20s.
- Have no qualifications.
- Left education at 16 to work for family business but want to move on.
- Never been smart, no special talents or anything.

And I want to teach myself code. Am I kidding myself?

I do have an interest but have no experience. I have a whole year off work to get started.

Please be brutally honest.
Very much considering joining the army if all falls apart so there's that.

Edit: Genuinely staggered by all these replies, thank you! Heaps of information, so glad I asked this here.

Going to get straight to it then. Success or not, might as well give it my best shot. Cheers!
