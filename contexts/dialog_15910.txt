LILI: Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
BARON: Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
JACK: Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
OONA: You... you... you mortal you!
JACK: Please...
OONA: Why should I feel such pain? Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
JACK: Threats won't make me love you. Tis not the way of the human heart.
OONA: What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
JACK: And as barren of love as stone.
OONA: I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
JACK: Be fair, Oona.
OONA: You beware, Jack! You and your porridge-pot heart!
