ANDREWS: What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
ELLIE: Nothing.
ANDREWS: You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I— Isn't all this what you wanted? You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
ELLIE: Oh, no.
ANDREWS: If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you. You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
ELLIE: Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
