My manager asks me to do things which I am not supposed to do.
I work as a software engineer in a company with less than 25 employees including one manager.
Our team includes four employees. We work for a client in korea. 
My main job includes Mobile testing and automation.
Recently our client asked to ship few devices to korea for research and development purposes. Those devices are local to the place where I live. 
My manager is asking me to take contact all courier companies and ship them to korea. Well it is not actually my job to do so. Since there are less employees, he expects us to do these sort of things.
I want to say no but I'm afraid he is going to lay me off. And I need this job to survive especially during this time. How can I say 'no' to my manager without him being offended. My manager is pretty old and short tempered. Please help. 
If I accept to do this, he might ask me more which could be similar to this kind of job.
