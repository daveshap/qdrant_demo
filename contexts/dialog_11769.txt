DIANE: I'll help you with the coffee.
ANNIE: Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
DIANE: No reason you should, no reason you should.
DIANE: I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
ANNIE: I was there for that shot, actually.
DIANE: What was it like?
ANNIE: Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
ANNIE: But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time. I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
DIANE: I'd love to go there one time...
ANNIE: You and Frank ever take a vacation?
DIANE: Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
TWIN: IT WAS MY TURN!
JOE: YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
TWIN: WAS SO!
