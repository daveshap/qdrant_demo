Disheartening rejection of papers
I'm so disappointed and disheartened right now. We submitted two papers from my recently (in January) concluded PhD work to Science.

Both got rejected at the editorial desk citing the work is not of enough interest to the broader scientific community.

In February when we uploaded the preprints to bioarxiv, they generated a storm of discussions on multiple fora which included experimental and theoretical neuroscientists, philosophers and even physicists as we tackled the question of whether the frontal or occipital brain regions are responsible for conscious awareness (monkey electrophysiology with Utah arrays using no-report binocular rivalry).

Yeah, but technical papers on oscillations in memory get published. How is that of general interest when ours generated a storm of discussions by people from multiple disciplines? 

Literally work on the same thing from our own lab has been published multiple times in Science and Nature in the past 20 yrs. 

7 yrs of work. Damn it. 7 yrs for these 2 papers.

We are now going to Nat Neuro.

God, so frustrated.
