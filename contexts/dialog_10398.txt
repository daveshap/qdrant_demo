DETECTIVE HUGO: Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir? I mean besides what's on his sheet.
INVESTIGATOR: Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies. Do you need any more than that?
DETECTIVE HUGO: With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes. Maybe he's just unlucky.
INVESTIGATOR: I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky. Widen the sweep. The West side. Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca. Hoover some of the classier establishments. Random car stops.
DETECTIVE HUGO: We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
