Social Media and Networking
So, I have used social media since 2008 with Facebook. Instagram, Snapchat, and Tumblr followed after when I entered college. I tried Twitter briefly but I really did not like it. The only network I use online is LinkedIn. As I transition to graduate school I know that social media is more critical than ever in connecting with others, especially students; however, I have personally stopped using social media for the sake of my mental health. I lost sleep and even felt waves of depression and low self-esteem from using it. I feel like sometimes I am missing out on conversations if I don't have social media and I have been debating whether I will go back. I have found it better for me to stay away from it because it can become visual noise if the proper filters are not put in place to make for a productive time on social media. If I were to go back, it would at most be Facebook and Twitter. What is some advice you all have? Am I  weird for limiting my social media?
