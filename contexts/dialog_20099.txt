SID: I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
ZACK: You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
SID: What? You've gotta be kidding!
ZACK: Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
SID: I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
ZACK: That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from. Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
