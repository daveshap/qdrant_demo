ERIN: I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
GEORGE: Come on, Erin. A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
ERIN: I'm not in danger. I have a dead bolt. Remember?
GEORGE: Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
ERIN: No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them. But you know what? They're wrong.
GEORGE: It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin. There's a lot of jobs out there.
ERIN: How would you know?
GEORGE: You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
ERIN: Nothing.
GEORGE: If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
ERIN: I didn't say that.
GEORGE: Cause I can get a job. I will. And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again. Would that make you happy?
ERIN: Keep your voice down.
GEORGE: I know what they can sleep through, Erin. I probably know it better than you.
ERIN: Hey, Ross. Tell me something. Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
ROSS: I don't know what you're talking about.
ERIN: The fuck you don't. No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you. People are dying, Ross. You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it. I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
