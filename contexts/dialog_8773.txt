MILLER: Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
STARCK: We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
COOPER: How? The Bridge is gone.
STARCK: There must be a way! What about Engineering?
COOPER: Can you shut it down?
STARCK: I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
COOPER: I don't want to go where the last crew went. I'd rather be dead.
MILLER: BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
STARCK: Blow it up?
MILLER: We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
COOPER: ...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
MILLER: You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
COOPER: Will it work?
MILLER: It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
STARCK: I'll do it --
MILLER: No. I'll be right back.
