Is life this boring - just working 40+ hours every week, and paying bills?
Is life this boring - just working 40+ hours every week, and paying bills?

I'm 25, in corporate America, and spend 40+ hours working for an employer I like. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy my job but there's got to be more to life then just this?!?

When I was 18, I thought by 25 I'd have it all figured out by now. That I was going to be highly successful and whatnot. But life is kind of boring...
