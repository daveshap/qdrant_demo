My feelings are Invalid
Everything was great. And then you had to go. And me being upset about you just wanting to be friends is foreign to everyone. Me wanting space to process losing you as a partner... I mean we were only together for a month but damn. I enjoyed you. I was falling for you. But you know, you can't actually fall for people. Not anymore. No one actually believes in soulmates, and you know what? I don't believe it either anymore. I'm tired of being patient for people to get their head out of their ass, and I'm tired of thinking I might have met someone worth while only to find out that they're not. 

Fuck. Love.
Fuck. Sex.
Fuck the need to have a partner.

You know? Because men are meant to fuck everything in sight. And humans are carnally are non- monogamous. If that's so then why do I have this desire?


I want to just fucking disappear. Because none of this is worth it. 

The only reason life is worth living is because I have a job obligation. And the hope that life will eventually be worth living.
