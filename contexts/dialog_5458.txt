THEO: Hey Buddy! Can you let me pull over? Give me some space to pull over.
2ND DRIVER: Where do you think you're going?
THEO: Any place.
2ND DRIVER: This is one way.
THEO: I know. But it's an emergency. Somebody dying. Okay?
2ND DRIVER: I don't see anybody in there but you.
THEO: I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
THEO: Fine, no tunnel. Are you still with me? Hello?
LENORE: I hear them coming upstairs. I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep. So don't talk. Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
THEO: I can't stay on this line. I'm picking people up. I'm already overdue. Hello?
