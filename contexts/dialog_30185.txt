KUJAN: He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
VERBAL: I never heard of him.
KUJAN: His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
VERBAL: I said I never heard of him.
KUJAN: But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
VERBAL: I don't
KUJAN: There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
VERBAL: But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent t us to kill someone?
