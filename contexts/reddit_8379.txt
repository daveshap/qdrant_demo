Are there any measurable impacts of modern political satire?
Since the election of Trump, our appetite for news has done nothing but grow. [In fact, Americans spent almost 2 more hours consuming news during the 2016 election cycle than they did during the 2012 cycle.](http://fortune.com/2017/04/03/nielsen-news-report/)

- [Subscriptions to Washington Post have risen.]( http://www.politico.com/media/story/2016/12/the-profitable-washington-post-adding-more-than-five-dozen-journalists-004900)

Regardless of how these statistics are interpreted, the political news business is booming in the age of Trump. This can be seen especially clear within the success of political satire, and comedians like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, and John Oliver.

- After leaving The Daily Show, earning massive success on the Colbert Report, and taking over The Late Show, [host Stephen Colbert now averages 3.2 million viewers per night.]( http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-stephen-colberts-winning-streak-hits-7-weeks-987663)

- [The January 11th episode on TBS of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, about a week before Trumps inauguration, aired to an audience of 2.11 million viewers.]( http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/full-frontal-with-samantha-bee-ratings-bump-trump-1201991397/)

These comedians are almost overwhelming left leaning, I understand that, but I’m very interested in seeing how both left, right, and middle respond to my questions. It also begs the question: [**Why is there no conservative Jon Stewart?**]( https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/02/why-theres-no-conservative-jon-stewart/385480/)

**My Questions:**

1. Are there any measurable impacts of modern political satire?

2. Is satire hurting or helping the current political discourse considering [how divided we are as a nation?](http://www.gallup.com/poll/197828/record-high-americans-perceive-nation-divided.aspx)

3. What is the right's equivalent of this satire trend and what are it's broader impacts?

4. How do you personally approach the consumption of political satire and what is your advice to others?
