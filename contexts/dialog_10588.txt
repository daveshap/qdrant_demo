DOC: We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
CAROL: Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
DOC: Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
CAROL: Oh, Jesus... how?
DOC: Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
CAROL: I'll be ready.
DOC: Yeah.
CAROL: What's wrong?
DOC: I don't know.
CAROL: Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
DOC: Whatever you say.
