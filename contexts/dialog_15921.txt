BARON: Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
LILI: Kill me... I want... so nice...
BARON: Why should I kill you? A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
LILI: No more... please...
BARON: I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art. They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach. The pain remains constant.
LILI: Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
BARON: Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
LILI: What do you want from me?
BARON: At the moment, very little. Your company at my table...
BARON: We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
LILI: Oh, yes...
BARON: A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
LILI: And then?
BARON: Yes?
LILI: What will become of me then?
BARON: When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
LILI: I see...
BARON: I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
LILI: Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
BARON: Your soul...? Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
LILI: I don't expect you'd understand.
BARON: My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity. I suggest you spend some hours before the glass. Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
LILI: You're a beast!
BARON: Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
GUMP: Never felt so cold in all me born days...
JACK: The chill is worse this night.
JIMMY: It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
JACK: A castle's but stone and mortar --
JIMMY: Nay. Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
GUMP: Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
JACK: It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we? For all the dark magic protecting it.
