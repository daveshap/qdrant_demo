BOURNE: It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
IRENA: You're a liar.
BOURNE: You know I'm not.
IRENA: YOU'RE A LIAR!
BOURNE: Look at me.
IRENA: I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
BOURNE: I can't let you do that either.
IRENA: Because you're afraid!
BOURNE: No. Because you don't want to know how it feels.
BOURNE: I have to go now.
IRENA: Is this really happening?
BOURNE: I'm sorry.
