BO CATLETT: Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of Freaks" and put 'em in this other one
HARRY: I can't do it.
BO CATLETT: You positive about that?
HARRY: It's a different kind of deal.
BO CATLETT: Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
RONNIE: By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
