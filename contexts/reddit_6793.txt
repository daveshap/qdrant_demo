Recruiters: how impressive/doesn't make a difference when a candidate puts together a plan?
Hi,

I read multiple places online that hiring managers are really impressed when you put together a plan powerpoint or information on what you would do/ideas to improve.  Also read online that they like 30-60-90 day plans.  I started thinking of some but don't want to be too forward showing all the changes that can be made.  

Also, my next interview is a phone interview and so I can't present anything in person.  Can I say something like I would love to meet you in person and show you a plan I put together?  But also I don't want to set up too high expectations for the plan and rather it be something surprising they see at the end.

Would really love to get this job and I passed the phone screen and have a phone interview with the hiring manager so I'm just trying to practice a lot and think of ways to stand out without being in person.

Thanks in advance!
