QUINCE: C'mon, have a drink. You look like you need one bad as me.
JOE: Do I? I'm a little confused.
QUINCE: Confused, huh? About what?
JOE: Love.
QUINCE: 'Love'? Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
JOE: You love Allison, don't you?
QUINCE: Oh yes, I do.
JOE: How did you meet?
QUINCE: I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
JOE: But she loves you?
QUINCE: Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
JOE: 'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
QUINCE: Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
JOE: What do you mean 'free'?
QUINCE: Free to love each other. Com- pletely. Totally. No fear.
JOE: Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
QUINCE: What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish? I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you. Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place. He was setting up Bill from day one. Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside. And I was the fool who made it all happen. Oh God, what do I do?
