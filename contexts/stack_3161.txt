How much energy does the replicator consume? I have been seeing in various comments references to replicators in Star Trek, occasionally arguing against various scenarios from the standpoint of energy usage - with arguments along the lines of \"you might be able to replicate something that big, but the energy requirement would be astronomical.\" We probably don't have any solid math explaining how this is done - however, are there any specific mentions that touch on the in-universe cost of this process?
