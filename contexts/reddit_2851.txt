New job offers 30% off college courses, plus a $7000/year stipend for courses, not sure what to take or who to ask for help! What do I do?
Started a new job at a day habiliation facility and my employer offers tuition reimbursement and employees receive 30% off tuition as long as they pursue a degree that will help them advance in our agency.

The short list of courses intimidates me a little bit: management (commanding people's respect), marketing (predicting what people want and potentially working in sales), accounting (numbers), and business (which I got away from because I didn't deal well with the type A go getter culture).

So I'm not sure what to take, or even if I want to take anything our employer offers (but I know I should, I can't do an entry level position forever).

But here's what I'm going to do: 

-I'm going to mention to my bosses (who I got off on the right foot with!) that I already have a bachelor's in Psych. I'm going to ask what the best way to benefit agency with my degree and continuing education is and see what they say or see what direction they point me in.

Is that a good plan or is what I'm planning to say too "on the nose," and looking too much like I'm only looking to help myself?
