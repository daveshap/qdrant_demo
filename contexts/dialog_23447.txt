ANN: I hate my sister.
DOCTOR: Why?
ANN: Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
DOCTOR: There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
ANN: I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
