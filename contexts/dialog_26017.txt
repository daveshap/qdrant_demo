MIKEY: Consuelo. Are you crying?
CONSUELO: No.
MIKEY: Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
CONSUELO: Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
MIKEY: Speak English.
CONSUELO: Mi Jesus esta muerto!
MIKEY: Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
CONSUELO: My Jesus…
MIKEY: Who is Jesus?
CONSUELO: My baby.
MIKEY: You have a bay?
CONSUELO: My grandchild-baby.
MIKEY: Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
CONSUELO: He's dead.
MIKEY: Oh. How did it happen?
CONSUELO: He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
MIKEY: How did they execute him?
CONSUELO: Poison gas.
MIKEY: Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
CONSUELO: Jesus was not bad.
MIKEY: Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
CONSUELO: He wasn't.
MIKEY: But still, you can't be sure.
CONSUELO: I am sure.
MIKEY: But really, you never know.
CONSUELO: I know!
MIKEY: Why was he on Death Row?
CONSUELO: For rape and murder.
MIKEY: Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
CONSUELO: It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
MIKEY: Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
CONSUELO: Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
