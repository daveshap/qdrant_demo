JUDGE GARNETT: Let's continue.
JOE: You had one guy like that?""
KENTON: Yeah. But we took care of him.
JOE: How did you do that?
KENTON: We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
JOE: You taught him a lesson.
KENTON: Yes, we did.
JOE: Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
BELINDA: Objection!
JOE: I'll withdraw. You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
KENTON: <u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
JOE: So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
KENTON: I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
JOE: But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
KENTON: I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
