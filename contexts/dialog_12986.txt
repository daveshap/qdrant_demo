PAUL: Ten.
CAPTAIN: And four children?
PAUL: I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
CAPTAIN: Give me it.
PAUL: I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
CAPTAIN: You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
PAUL: I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
