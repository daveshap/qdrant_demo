ANDERTON: Sean -- you're not real.
SEAN: You gotta have faith, Dad.
ANDERTON: It's a little late for that.
SEAN: Wanna hear something funny?
ANDERTON: What the hell.
SEAN: I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father. He took me all over the world.
ANDERTON: You're alive?
SEAN: No. He got tired of pretending.
ANDERTON: Oh, Sean --
SEAN: The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
ANDERTON: Sean --
SEAN: I feel bad about that. I need you to forgive me.
ANDERTON: I forgive you.
SEAN: Once I even told him I loved him.
ANDERTON: I forgive you...
SEAN: The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
ANDERTON: I was looking for you...
SEAN: I know that. I know you would have done anything to find me. I know you would have died for me.
ANDERTON: I wanted to.
SEAN: Good-bye, Dad...
ANDERTON: Who are you?
SEAN: I'm your son. I'm you.
ANDERTON: Sean, wait...
SEAN: Hold your breath, Dad...
BURGESS: This is all my fault.
LARA: No, it isn't, Lamar. There was nothing anyone could do.
