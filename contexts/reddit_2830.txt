I’m calling in sick to my current job tomorrow for a job interview. I’m pretty sure this will get me fired based on my circumstance. Any advice for my interview tomorrow?
My current role is awful and has extremely high turnover. It’s only a matter of time before I’m canned regardless adding the fact that taking this interview will get me fired from my current role sucks. Either way, how should I approach my job interview tomorrow? I’m sure they will be asking about my current role and if I do get fired Friday the day after my interview won’t it look bad or fishy? Idk the timing of this is very stressful so any sort of tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Possibly relevant additional info: 
- Was told in the beginning June that I had to self something by the end of the week or I was fired. Still here a month and a half later 
- Not hitting metrics and have PTO this Mon-Wednesday for a vacation. 
- Missing an important team meeting tomorrow for this interview. Feel fairly confident I’ll be getting fired when I come in Friday. 

Just to reiterate I’m just looking for some advice for how to approach my interview tomorrow and how/if I should explain my current situation. 

Thanks thanks thanks!!!
