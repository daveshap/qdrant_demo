I like this girl but I am a very socially awkward.
As the title suggests, I like this girl(we were in primary school together but then we separated due to different schools) and I recently messaged her to see if we could meet up and I didn’t really go as planned.

I messaged her to see if she could meet up with me and we could reconnect. She said she would but then 1 week before we were going to she didn’t really want to anymore. I have a big crush on her but I don’t know if she has the same feelings for me or if she is actually seeing someone else.

Also I’m a very socially awkward person(especially around people I have feelings for) so I don’t know what to do at all.

Please could I have some advice on how to go about this as I use to really think it would work out together but now I’m not to sure.
