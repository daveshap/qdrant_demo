I don't know how to approach a girl
I'm 15 and she's too. She has been in my class for about 5 jears now and i liked her for about two jears now.  We're good right now, but we don't talk normally and we have different friend groups. 
She's like at least a League above me and two other guys who are in her friend group and they are in her League. I think they like her too and I'm pretty shy.
What do I do
