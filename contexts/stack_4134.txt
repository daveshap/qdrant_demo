Credit card used while booking I have an Alitalia flight from Munich, Germany to Delhi, India and I booked it using an online agency. I did not use my credit card for the booking and paid using my friend's credit card. Do I still need to carry the copy of the credit card and the authorization letter to the airport even when I booked the flight from a third party? I cannot find the information on the Alitalia website.
