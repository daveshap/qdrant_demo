Thinking of quitting my new job after 3 weeks for a $40K pay cut. Am I insane?
Been at my new job in a new city for about 3 weeks. The work is fine, but not my passion. I've been offered a job at my dream company, doing exactly the work I want to do, in the city I want to be (other side of the country, where my girlfriend currently lives). I know quitting a job you just started is generally poor etiquette. I know the girlfriend part probably isn't relevant to this subreddit, but it's a pretty major component for me (we've already been long distance for \~2 years).

The other major piece to consider is the money. The salary and benefits are about the same, but the new job has no signing bonus. My current job has a huge signing bonus (about $40K). If I quit in less than a year, I have to pay it back. I haven't spent it yet (since I was aware this situation might happen). I could just suck it up and stay for a year, but I'm worried I might not get another opportunity like this, plus I don't want to set my career back an entire year. What do I do?
