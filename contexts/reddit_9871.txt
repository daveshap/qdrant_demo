Optional graduate certificate - Beneficial or no?
I'm looking for some advice/outside opinions - I am currently enrolled in a M.A. Higher Education Administration program as well as an optional Academic Advising certificate (2 extra classes for the certificate). I initially chose to add on the certificate because I was planning on working in academic advising, however, I recently switched roles and am working as an Admissions Specialist now and think that I want to stick around the admissions counseling area instead. 

Does anyone have experience or anecdotal evidence regarding graduate certificate benefits? Will earning the academic advising certificate be useful/will it give me a leg up compared to other applicants in potential job searches, or is it useless in the end?
