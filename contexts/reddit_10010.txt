I go to a chill university... I ended up here.
Hey everyone.

Let me put it to you this way, I want to feel like I'm the next Mark Zuckerburg at Harvard, when I wake up and go to university.

I'm in law school at the moment, but man, I go to school in North Wales and the people here are just too chill and leave class to go shopping and utter nonsense like that.

I'm an beginner app developer, budding business person and overall creative guy, but since I left my hometown of Toronto, Canada and came to Wales the cutthroat and creative version of myself has left and been a bit replaced by a chill, relaxed and more lazy version of my self. 

What do you guys recommend to get that go go go mojo back and become super extremely hard working again? 

A big thank you.
