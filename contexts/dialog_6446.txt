TED: Originally just another species like yourselves. Well, not like you at all actually, but...
ELLIE: Can you show me?
TED: Small moves, Captain, small moves.
ELLIE: Why did you contact us?
TED: You contacted us. We were simply listening. We've been listening for millions of years.
ELLIE: And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
TED: Many others.
ELLIE: And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
TED: Oh, we didn't build it. The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
ELLIE: So who...?
TED: We don't know. Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
ELLIE: The scale... it's just... So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
