NORMAN: Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
CLAIRE: What are you...? No.
NORMAN: You know what I've got at stake with this paper. You know that. I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
CLAIRE: Sabotage?

CLAIRE: The accident...?
NORMAN: But then you've been so much better...
CLAIRE: Norman, this isn't about you. This is something that's happening to me. It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention. Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
NORMAN: Sweetheart--
CLAIRE: No! Not sweetheart, no. I believe in what's happening. I don't want to, but I do. I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
