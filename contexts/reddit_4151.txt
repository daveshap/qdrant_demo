Just Deleted my Dating Apps and I feel Great
I think at this point, it was time to throw in the towel. I've been on these apps since my breakup with my ex and a year and a half ago, and really had no success.

When I first started using the apps, I was naive. Everytime I got a match, I got a feeling of excitement. At this point, even if I get matched with a super attractive girl, I feel nothing because now I know better. 100% of my matches devolved into nothing, in one way or another. 

- Either they don't message you at all.
- They don't respond to your messages when you message first.
- They take days to respond (which is fine if they're busy, but more often than not it implies they don't care to speak to you and I just take the hint).
- They produce thoughtless responses that don't promote conversation.
- They don't want to go on a date.
- They accept the date and then flake.
- You go on the date and they suddenly ghost you afterwards.
- They are not ready for a relationship.

Yeah, sure, I've had great conversations with some girls -no doubt. But still, at some point in time the interaction ended with any of the points above.

Eventually this was starting to affect me in my daily life outside of these apps. Not because it didn't work out with girls specifically, but because it just killed any motivation about me to be excited about anything in my daily life. I felt like if something good happened to me, it would only be a matter of time before something disappointing would follow. As if to say I didn't deserve good things to happen to me, because that's what I was used to in my experience in these apps for the past year and a half.

I stuck with these apps just hoping for that "one girl" to surpass all these rest, but it never came to be. One could probably just say "man up, rejection is part of the game ", but hey, it's not like I've been on these apps for just a week or two. A year and a half and nothing. Enough is enough. When I realized it got to the point where it's affecting my ability to get excited about good things in my life, the solution became obvious. So I deleted the apps.

Now obviously I'll have the thoughts like "well, if I'm not on the apps now the 'one girl' can't reach out to me", but it's this exact mindset that keeps me in this vicious loop of disappointment. Clinging on to an idea that really has proved to have no basis in my experience. If I'm going to find someone, it's going to be in person.

And now I feel great. I'm no longer wasting time spamming swipes, looking through superficial profiles. It feels great to not feed into the validation that some people use these apps for. 

This is not an attack about girls on the apps. Ladies, I know full well there are tons and tons of disappointing guys on these apps as well, I just can't speak to that from a personal experience. 

If any of you feel like this situation describes you, I definitely recommend just letting go. Seriously. Delete them and spend the time you would have spent swiping and analyzing profiles and do something that makes you happy instead.

Thanks for reading.
