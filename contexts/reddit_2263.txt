#Part 7:  How To End An Essay Gracefully

Ending essays is hard, and most students struggle to end their essay elegantly.  Mistakes here can linger in the reviewer's mind and really bring down what might have otherwise been a strong essay.  They often seem to end:

**1.  Abruptly as if the word count snuck up on them** and tackled them from behind just as they were drawing a breath to continue.  Sometimes this is actually what happened and the student didn't edit very well (if this is you, see Part 5 linked above).  

**2.  By simply rehashing something that was already stated** â€“ a casualty of the common yet misguided advice to make your point thrice over in your introduction, body, and conclusion.  Other times students turn to their academic BSing skills and just say the same things a slightly different way to fill out the word count.  If this sounds familiar, see Part 6 linked above.

**3.  With a trite aphorism or sweeping generality.**  Examples include phrases such as "striving to achieve our full potential," "making the world a better place," etc.  These are commonplace and lame, but worse, they say nothing about the student.  Instead, they make the AO instantly aware that the author is trying to make an impression with such a statement and it causes skepticism about the sincerity of everything they just read.  

#So how do you end an essay in a compelling and purposeful way?

Obviously you want to give the sense that the essay actually ended intentionally rather than being stifled by the word count or trailing off into awkward silence.  You also want to leave a final good impression.  You need to close gracefully, sincerely, and purposefully so they continue to feel positively about you and reward you with a top score.  Here are a few ideas - there are more in the full guide available on my site.  I'd love to hear any others you have in the comments.

#The Comedian's Call Back

I'm fond of the "call back" commonly used by comedians (see:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(comedy)). You reference something from earlier in your essay to say one more thing about yourself. Sometimes this is something that you used to start the essay off. Other times it's something that was a major theme of the essay, a big part of the story you told, or a salient insight or twist on something you mentioned before.   

#The Interchapter

Another option is to depart from the story and inject something more about you. Examples of this in literature include the socialist meeting Jurgis stumbles upon at the end of Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and John Galt's speech at the end of Atlas Shrugged.  You obviously don't have the space to elaborate here, so one or two sentences is probably enough.  You will want to work in a smooth transition though so it doesn't feel jilted or like it "breaks the fourth wall."  One example of a good way to do this is to end with a quote about you spoken by one of the characters in your story.

However you choose to end, try to show depth of thought, introspection, maturity, and humility.  Just like great stories, when you do this right, the AO finishes the essay wishing it had continued longer.  They want to know more about you and are intrigued by the personality you presented.
