"Don't just tell me your TA sucked - name them, and tell us how they sucked!"
The professor I've been TA'ing for this quarter said this to our students on the last day of lecture, in front of us. Due to the general incompetence of this professor, the other TA and I have had to put so much work into this one class that we're literally behind on every other responsibility. We asked for help multiple times, and were told that we were just "doing too much" or that we "care too much" or that we have "time management problems". Even taking as many shortcuts as we could, we spent up to 50 hours per week on just work for this course.

We talked to the department chair about this, and it sounds like action is going to be taken in some form or another. I'm feeling pretty low at the moment. I'm so behind on my research, I feel utterly hopeless. I'm not sure I'm looking for advice, I just wanted somewhere to talk about this. Thanks for reading.
