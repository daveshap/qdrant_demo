PENDERGAST: You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
FROCK: Yes.
PENDERGAST: Are there any hidden rooms or staircases? Places where someone could hide?
FROCK: Not really. Just the sub-basement.
PENDERGAST: Where is that?
FROCK: I don't know. It was walled over. No one's been down there in years.
PENDERGAST: You said you had plans of the museum. Could we see them, please?
