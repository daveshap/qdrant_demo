BOBBY: We look good this year.
RICKY: We'll kill Fairfax this year.
BOBBY: I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
RICKY: Fuck him.
BOBBY: Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
RICKY: What are we delivering?
BOBBY: We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
RICKY: Who is this fucking Ruiz?
BOBBY: Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
RICKY: Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
BOBBY: I gotta pick up the baby.
RICKY: Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
BOBBY: I like it.
RICKY: It's not even yours.
BOBBY: I like it.
BOBBY: Nice work.
RICKY: Shhh... Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there. You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
BOBBY: How'd you unlock my phone?
RICKY: I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
BOBBY: Seat belt.
CHLOE: Ricky's not wearing one.
BOBBY: Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
RICKY: No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
BOBBY: C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
RICKY: Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
BOBBY: See? Now everyone's got one on. What do you got there?
CHLOE: A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
BOBBY: She's, uh, sleeping.
CHLOE: It's daytime.
BOBBY: Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
CHLOE: No.
BOBBY: Show uncle Ricky what you made.
