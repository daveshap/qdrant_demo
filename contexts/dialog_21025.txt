O'BRIEN: What in the...?
SUSAN: Oh shit, the meltdown. It's spread to the tower.
O'BRIEN: We've got to get the nanobot.
SUSAN: It's too late. Argon injected it.
O'BRIEN: You mean he's polymerized, like me?
O'BRIEN: That means the nanobot is still inside him.
SUSAN: Yes.
O'BRIEN: What would happen if I threw him into the core?
SUSAN: The same thing I suppose.
ARGON: Did you feel that?
POPPY: Did I? I've been waiting for that for years.
ARGON: Not that.
