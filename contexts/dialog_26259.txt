GILLIS: Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
MAX: There are no locks anywhere in this house.
GILLIS: How come?
MAX: The doctor suggested it.
GILLIS: What doctor?
MAX: Madame's doctor. She has moments of melancholy. There have been some suicide attempts.
GILLIS: Uh-huh?
MAX: We have to be very careful. No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
GILLIS: Why? Her career? She got enough out of it. She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
MAX: I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
GILLIS: You send them. Is that it, Max?
MAX: I'd better press your evening clothes, sir. You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
GILLIS: No, I haven't. I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
MAX: I don't know, sir. Madame made the arrangements.
