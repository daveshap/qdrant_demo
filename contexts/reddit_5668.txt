Currently unemployed, anything I can work on while I'm looking for a job?
I'm a recent MBA grad and I've been looking for a job for the past ~6 months. I've been getting interviews from time to time, but unfortunately nothing has stuck yet. I'm at the point where I'm just so sick of having nothing to work on besides job applications and I feel like I should be using this time to improve myself and/or increase my employability in some way. I've looked into business related certifications (PMP, SCMP, Lean Six Sigma etc. ) but they all seem to require a minimum level of hours within that field (which I don't have) or that you are currently working in that field (which I am not). I realize the answer to the question is going to depend on what direction I'd like to take with my career, but broadly speaking, and there any business related certifications/courses I should be looking into that would not only boost my resume, but also give me a positive explanation for what I have been doing in lieu of working for the past several months? I've already been working on polishing my Excel skills but I'm just looking for a bit more of a tangible accreditation that is recognized by employers which would help distinguish me from other applicants.
