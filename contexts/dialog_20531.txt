GABRIEL: Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
MARION: When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
GABRIEL: When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them.
MARION: Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
GABRIEL: Yes.
LEE: One of yours?
MARION: Gabriel.
LEE: I recognize him now. Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
MARION: No, thank the Lord. He's more like his mother.
LEE: I'll see to it that he serves under me.
MARION: Thank you.
MARION: Not yet, Thomas.
THOMAS: When?
MARION: Seventeen.
THOMAS: But it's already been two years and that's two more years. The war could be over by then.
MARION: God willing.
