GABE: Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
QUALEN: Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
HAL: Qualen, go fuck yourself. The game's over--you lost.
QUALEN: No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
HAL: What are you talking about?
