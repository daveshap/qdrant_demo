I hate eating and wish it wasn't a laborious chore
I find it surprising as heck that I couldn't find a single relevant post on the Internet about my problem. So I had to post about it. 

The very few posts I did manage to find where someone felt this way always received the same canned response unfortunately. "You must have an eating disorder and you should speak to a therapist/doctor." I don't think anything is wrong with me. I just wish that I could take a nutrition pill so I didn't have to waste time cooking and eating. Unfortunately, that isn't possible so I wish I could figure out how to find pleasure in the process or how I could get by with cooking very infrequently - and when I do have to cook, doing it in a way that is quick, cheap, healthy and mindless. 

Hopefully this resonates with someone and has got a solution for me. Thanks for reading and I appreciate any ideas!
