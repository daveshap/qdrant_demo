SA Professionals relationship with EdTech
Hi all!

I have a Higher Ed masters but my career is currently in K12/higher-ed edtech due to personal reasons + visa sponsorship issues.

What I've noticed when I reach out to higher ed professionals is an overall distrust in Edtech tools. This might be warranted due to the many tools that exist on the market or pushy salespeople who don't understand their users. 

For those who have purchased or partnered with external tools/platforms to support their work, I'd love to have your advice on what's most important to you when deciding whether to use/buy a tool and/or when recommending a tool to your students. 

Hope it's alright to ask that here and I value your honest responses!
