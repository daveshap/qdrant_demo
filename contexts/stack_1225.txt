What is the difference between Federated and Decentralized Data Warehouse? I can not find any clear definitions or explanations of any of these. Both seem decentralized. It appears that in Federated DWH, the data is distributed and not integrated into a single repository and accessed from distributed sources. While in Decentralized DWH implementation the data is integrated into one central repository. Please explain the difference between these two implementations.
