New texts between FBI agent Peter Strzok and DOJ attorney Lisa Page were released today. Do they tell a story, and if so what is it?
FBI agent Peter Strzok and DOJ attorney Lisa Page were removed from the Mueller investigation after these text messages were discovered last year.

Do the texts contain messages that could be construed as bias against President Trump?  

Are there texts where similar statements or opinions are made about Obama or Hillary?

What are we to conclude from these messages?

For example:

>"Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart. l could SMELL the Trump support."
"Yup. Out to lunch with ––––––– We both hate everyone and everything."

Page 62 of attached doc.

>God I'm so disappointed in us as an organization. I want to send 10 polygraphers to [censored] and poly the whole office. Or do every. Single. Last. Employee.

Page 495

>"Omg Gowdy is being a total dick. All investigative questions. And Jason isn't always sticking to the script on "I'm not answering that."" "Horrible. This was a mistake."

Page 372

>Stupid*ss Bernie supporters shouting no more war so that he couldn't be heard hardly at all. I'm sorry, they're idiots.

Page 64

>"God Trump is a loathsome human."

>"Yeah, it is pretty cool. She just has to win now. I'm not going to lie, I got a flash of nervousness yesterday about trump. The sandernistas have the potential to make a very big mistake here..." - 2016-07-27 00:21:39 (Wed) "I'm not worried about them. I'm worried about the anarchist Assanges who will take fed information and disclose it to disrupt. [redacted]"

>'You've got to read the article I sent. I'm infuriated. I f‐ing hate  people.'
'I started. And while i hate Trump, part of me thought would not/may not get into  because they're white and not from buttf*ck Texas'

A whole exchange on page 272 that I can't easily reproduce here.

>Out: Yeah but the d has done that. Chaffetz texts him directly.

Page 128, part of a longer exchange.

>"So look, you say we text on that phone when we talk about hillary because it can't be traced, you were just venting bc you feel bad that you're gone so much but it can't be helped right now"

Page 45

>Are you even going to give out your calendars? Seems kind of depressing. Maybe it should just be the first meeting of the secret society.

Page 154

>"But Mr. Reid argued that the connections between some Donald J Trumps former and current advisers and the Russian leadership should, by itself, prompt an investigation. He referred indirectly in his letter to a speech given in Russia by one Trump advisor, Carter Page, a consultant and investor in the energy giant Gazprom, who criticized American sanctions policy toward Russia. Trump and his people keep saying the election is rigged, Mr. Reid said. Why is he saying that? Because people are telling him the election can be messed with. Mr. Trumps advisers say they are concerned that unnamed elites could rig the election for his opponent, Hillary Clinton"

>Because, you know, media leaks [are] what I do for a living.
