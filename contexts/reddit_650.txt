19 (M) Looking for advice.
I recently broke up with my girlfriend of a year, and now i feel so lost. I don’t know what to do with my time nowadays, all I do is work, go home to sit in my truck and just wait for the next day. I already suffer from severe anxiety and depression and I don’t have any close friends now besides the 2 or 3 people I occasionally smoke with. I just was wondering if anyone had any advice for meeting new people/ making new friends. I’d like to figure out who I really am and what my true interests are but I just don’t know what to do with myself. Any advice please?
