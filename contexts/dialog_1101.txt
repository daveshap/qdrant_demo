BERNSTEIN: Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
WOODWARD: We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
BRADLEE: This is a daily paper, we'll explain it tomorrow. You're certain on Mitchell?
WOODWARD: He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
ROSENFELD: --you got more than one source?--
BERNSTEIN: --yes--
SIMONS: --has any of them got an ax?--
ROSENFELD: --political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
WOODWARD: --no--
SIMONS: --can we use their names?--
BERNSTEIN: --no--
BRADLEE: --goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
ROSENFELD: --who you got?--
WOODWARD: --well, Sloan--
BERNSTEIN: --and we got a guy in Justice--
BRADLEE: --Deep Throat?--
WOODWARD: --I saw him. He verifies.
BRADLEE: OK. You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook. Just be right, huh?
