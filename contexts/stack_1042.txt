18.04 Live DVD intallation fails as partitions are not found Trying to install 18.04 (dual boot) on a new Dell Vostro 3670 with a 250gb ssd drive. After resizing the windows partition, I managed to boot from the 18.04 dvd and start the installation. However, after the first few installation screens I get the message \"Installation requires 8,6GB You have 0B\" and the only option is to exit the installation.I can guess that the primary win10 partition cannot be detected due to stupid Win10 hibernation features for fast boot. Any ideas why the unallocated part of the disk is not detectable ??
