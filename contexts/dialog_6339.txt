ROTTOVICH: Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
JAKE: Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
ROTTOVICH: Ring it for him, Sobo.
JAKE: Oh yeah. Moonan. I remember now. Thanks.
ROTTOVICH: Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
JAKE: Wouldn't dream of it.
ROTTOVICH: I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
JAKE: Something stupid.
ROTTOVICH: Good boy.
