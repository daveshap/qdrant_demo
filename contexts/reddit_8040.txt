I’m not sure what to do
I’m finishing my last class of my 2nd bachelor’s now and it won’t be finished until mid-August and I’m scheduled to start my MS degree in early September. I noticed a hold on my financial aid a while back and they told me don’t worry about it. I contacted them again and they told me they won’t even process it until I give them a final transcript from my current program. I have no idea what to do because I can’t afford this without financial aid.
