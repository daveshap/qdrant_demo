RAMÓN: We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
ESPERANZA: What?
RAMÓN: We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
ESPERANZA: What's more important than sanitation?
RAMÓN: The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
RAMÓN: First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
ESPERANZA: I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
RAMÓN: Now don't start talking against the union again.
ESPERANZA: What has it got me, your union?
RAMÓN: Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came? When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
ESPERANZA: All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
RAMÓN: Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
ESPERANZA: If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
RAMÓN: Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
ESPERANZA: Never... never... never!
RAMÓN: Aaah, what's the use?
