Live Linux with persistent Fails to boot I recently downloaded Lubuntu 17.04 and created live USB with Unetbootin from windows 10.Method I used is:Seperate USB partition to : OS(2GiB-FAT32) casper-rw(4GiB-ext4) home-rw(54GiB-ntfs) using Gparted on my Raspberry Pi B+.Set casper-rw file 100MB in Unetbootin and created live USBEdited grub.cfg and added 'persisent' (I'm not sure why persistent is off)Removed casper-rw fileBut after booting it, it runs into busybox. No single error message, just 'iniramfs>_'.I heard there is issue with initrd.lz itself when word 'persistent' is used in grub.cfg but there was no any answer, at least what I searched is....SO, the Question is :Is there any workaround for this? I need this USB to run lubuntu as soon as possible.And, why syslinux.cfg has word 'persistent' but why grub.cfg don't have it - although both are created by Unetbootin with persistent option?Please understand that my only Linux accessible is headless Raspberry pi, using VNC&amp;SSH. I already walked enough puting USB stick on Pi and my PC..EDIT: I fixed this issue via YUMI universal USB installer. No other method worked.
