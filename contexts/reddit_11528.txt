I screwed up a friendship all by myself
I'm a male, my best friend is a female. I've wanted to be more than friends with her for a long time, but I've been lying to myself and saying I don't, and I can't really do it anymore. I want to stop talking to her, because it reminds me of what's never going to happen (she doesn't feel the same way. I'm 100% sure.) but she deserves a better friend than that, and I don't want her to be sad. It sucks so hard.
