How to make apache2 serve HTTPS on port 443 and non-standard ports? Hi i want to change port in apache2. i was running owncloud on standard ports http=80 https=443. For some reasons i need to change https port from 443 to 8443. i have seen many solutions but i dont come to hundred percent result what i  want.i just want that when i write my hostname \"server\" then i just see my owncloud page. when i write my ipadress then i no need to mention port number but when i write \"server\" then i need to mention port number 8443 then it works. i am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. i have tried everything on virtualhost and also by ports.conf.  kindly tell me some solution if someone know .Thanks in advance
