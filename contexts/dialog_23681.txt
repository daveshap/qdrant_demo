DANNY: Chocolate.
HALLORAN: Chocolate it shall be. Come on son.
WENDY: It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
ULLMAN: Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
ULLMAN: By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
WENDY: Just like a ghost ship, huh?
ULLMAN: Yes.
