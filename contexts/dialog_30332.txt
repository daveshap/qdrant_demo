SCOTTIE: I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
MIDGE: Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
SCOTTIE: Just wander.
MIDGE: Where?
SCOTTIE: Around.
MIDGE: Oh?
SCOTTIE: Mm. Better.
MIDGE: Did you need it?
SCOTTIE: Yeah.
MIDGE: Oh?
SCOTTIE: What was this desperate urge to see me?
MIDGE: All I said in the note was: Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me."
SCOTTIE: Well, I detected an undercurrent.
MIDGE: I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
SCOTTIE: Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
MIDGE: Oh... this and that.
SCOTTIE: What I've been doing?
MIDGE: If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
SCOTTIE: Naturally.
MIDGE: What have you been doing?
SCOTTIE: Wandering.
