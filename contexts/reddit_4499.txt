I absolutely despise myself. How do I not?
 I'm terrible at everything I try. Everything I want to be good at I fuck up. I can barely cope with my (fantastic) job. I have absolutely no luck with women and am incredibly, insanely lonely as a result. I can't do anything I want to do because I know it won't be good enough.

How do I \[30M\] not feel this way? How do I not compare myself to others? How do I be good at things that I want to be good at? How do I not hate myself? This is all I've ever known.
