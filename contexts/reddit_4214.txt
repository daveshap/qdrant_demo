How has getting fit/lifting bettered your dating/sex life?
I always love hearing motivational stories from people who were lost in the dating scene until they focused on getting their bodies back in check. Whether it be casual or serious dating.

For me, girls seem to go nuts in the bedroom. Before when I had a dad bod, sex was just sort of meh. Now I've discovered that most women are freakier than me, and sometimes it's almost too much to handle lol. They go nuts when I take off the shirt, and theres no holding back ðŸ˜‚.

Also, being able to have more endurance and being able to last longer not only in bed but on activities such as hikes, bike rides, walks, etc. Those used to be 100% avoided date ideas but it opens up a realm of new date spots now that I dont get winded after 10 minutes of walking down a trail lmao.

In general I cant reccomend getting fit enough. I'd say 80% of peoples dating issues can be solved by dedicating yourself to looking good naked. You'd be surprised, I have talked to girls now that didnt give me the time of day before and all of their answers were "you got more attractive". Anyone can say looks dont matter but its science people, big arms and the "v" are the fastest way to a womens heart!
