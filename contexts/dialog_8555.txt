LUKE: Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
YODA: No! No different! The differences are in your mind. Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
LUKE: Okay. I'll give it a try.
YODA: No. Try not. Do, do. Or do not. There is no try.
LUKE: I can't. It's too big.
YODA: Size has no meaning. It matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size do you?
