CYNTHIA: Will you leave me alone, already...? No, Sean, it's over... I don't care... As a matter of fact, I am... Yeah. In his hotel room...
BIANCA: Holy shit.
CYNTHIA: I'm having fun, Sean. Can you handle that...? Yeah. He doesn't judge me.
RICKY: I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
CYNTHIA: That's a good idea, maybe I will!
