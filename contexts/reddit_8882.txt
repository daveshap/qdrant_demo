What are some arguments for and against the US's decision to spend so much on defense, and have military bases around the world?
The US spends as much on its military as do the next 8 countries (China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, UK, India and Germany). It has "nearly 800 bases in more than 70 countries".

I'd like to look at this question from two perspectives: 

1) Is this good for the US? What are the benefits, and do they justify the cost of maintaining such a huge defense budget?

2) Is this good for the world? Is there a benefit to having one country serve as a "leader" for the rest of the world?
