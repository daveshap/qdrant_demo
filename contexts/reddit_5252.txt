Do I need to be a people person to work insurance/sales?
So as with the title, I'm not exactly a huge people person as far as an outgoing, bubbly personality. It's not to say I don't like helping people but I guess in all fairness I'm a very dry/boring person. 

I've been working in retail for the past 6 months since I've graduated and although I don't particularly mind it, I kinda got cucked on any promotions for the next 6 months so I've started to look towards other opportunities. 

Thing is I've never really been able to be openly outgoing when I didn't actually mean it, it more or less just had to feel natural I guess.
