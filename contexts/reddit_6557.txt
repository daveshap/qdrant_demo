Is working mostly trying to keep your job?
At almost every company I've been at (either as employee or contractor) I see the same pattern:

90 % of people are **always** stressed. And they will not hesitate to tell you about their huge workload. When you dig deeper, it turns out they only did 2 minor things the whole week.

The other 10 % openly admit they have time on their hands - and are seen as the guys that are too lazy. So, slowly, those 10 % become less and less.

As a contractor, there was usually our team (the developers) and some kind of strategic team on the client's side. More often than not, the project was delayed (scope creep) because if the project would have finished on time, they (the strategic client team) wouldn't have had any work anymore. One client openly admitted the project is only still running in order to have work for 3 people.

So, my question is: Is having a job mostly "looking busy"?
