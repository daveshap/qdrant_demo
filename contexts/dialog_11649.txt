MARTIN: So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
SOUTHTEC GUARD: Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
MARTIN: So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
SOUTHTEC GUARD: To shoot you. Correct.
MARTIN: How did you get this job?
SOUTHTEC GUARD: Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
MARTIN: Wow.
