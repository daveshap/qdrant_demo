LOUIS: Where is she? Where's Claudia?
ARMAND: Follow me - that way - through my cell -
LOUIS: Not without Claudia. Where is she?
ARMAND: I can't save her.
LOUIS: You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
ARMAND: Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
LESTAT: You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
LOUIS: CLAUDIA!!!
ARMAND: I couldn't prevent it.
LOUIS: I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
ARMAND: Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
LOUIS: You let them do it.
LOUIS: You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
ARMAND: Louis, I swear I did not.
LOUIS: I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.
