I was supposed to go on a date today.
But instead I’m just going to go home, put on a face mask, make some dinner and knit.

Does anyone ever feel discouraged about dating? And feel like it is completely and utterly exhausting? 


I’ve been coming across people who are incredibly superficial and generic. I just want a genuine person who cares about the things that matter. Why am I having such a hard time finding one?


And the ones I do find myself actually liking are either already taken or just have not shown any interest in me. It’s exhausting. 

So I’m going to knit.
