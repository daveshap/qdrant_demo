JIM: Dad, please stop. Please. I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
JIM'S DAD: Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though. What you're doing is perfectly normal. It's like practice. Like when you play tennis against a wall. Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball. You do want a partner, don't you son?
JIM: Yes.
JIM'S DAD: That's great. Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself. Or, as I always called it -- Stroke the salami!" Ho-ho
COACH MARSHALL: Good work, Ostreicher.
OZ: Thanks coach.
COACH MARSHALL: You're a killer, Ozzy!

OZ: Hey, what're you doing here?
HEATHER: Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience. You like, kicked butt.""
