Failed my drivers test. Which only made things that much better
You know when things are not going great (they are not going horrible just not... good ) and you just really, really need a win, you are like: "This win can surely turn things around!".

Well I have been waiting forever to take my drivers test to get my license (Did not take it out at 16 because of reasons, Now 20-ish) and today was the day and I failed.

I practised for it (Been driving a while) even got a chance to redo it after practicing for a bit more and still failed again (which only made it hurt that much more), I get to try again in a week but I don't know.
 
When it came time to the test (Backing into a spot) I just locked up: Distances Seemed longer, Spaces got Smaller, Mistakes and over corrections were made and well that was that.

 I'm gonna keep practising but that does not take away from the fact that right now I feel like a total failure and frankly a little scared that I'm just gonna keep failing. In a while gonna go out with some friends try to get my mind off of things
