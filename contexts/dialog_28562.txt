KORUS: We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren. Do you know him?
ALEXANDER: No...
KORUS: He said he traveled for two months.
ALEXANDER: I took a different route.
KALEN: What did you do at night?
MARA: What's it like where you come from?
ALEXANDER: Oh, very different. But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such. But not everywhere. And more roads. And buildings.
KORUS: Why?
ALEXANDER: To live in. There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
KORUS: New Yorkers.
ALEXANDER: Yes. I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to? An elder or patriarch of some kind?
KORUS: I am the oldest.
ALEXANDER: No, I mean someone considerably older. Your father perhaps?
KORUS: My father has gone to a better place.
ALEXANDER: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
KORUS: Of course. You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
MARA: Yes.
ALEXANDER: Thank you.
