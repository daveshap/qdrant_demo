JOSIE: My own undercover feature - Written by Josie Geller"."
ANITA: Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
JOSIE: You don't think I can do it.
ANITA: No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
GUS: Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
JOSIE: But I don't want it straightened out.
GUS: Geller, this is way out of your league.
JOSIE: Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
ANITA: Jos, that's not what we're --
JOSIE: Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
ANITA: Senorita Josie.
JOSIE: And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
GUS: YOU DID.
ANITA: YOU KNIT?
