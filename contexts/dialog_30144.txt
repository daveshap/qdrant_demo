KEATON: He's alright.
HOCKNEY: How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
KEATON: His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
VERBAL: Roger really. People say I talk too much.
HOCKNEY: Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
KEATON: We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
VERBAL: County. I was in for fraud.
KEATON: You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
VERBAL: I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
