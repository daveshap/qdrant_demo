Here is [the story.](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/03/01/gop-wants-to-eliminate-shadowy-doj-slush-fund-bankrolling-leftist-groups.html)

>When big banks are sued by the government for discrimination or mortgage abuse, they can settle the cases by donating to third-party non-victims. The settlements do not specify how these third-party groups could use the windfall.

It seems pretty damning but also seems bit pie in the sky. And the crux of the complaint is based some assumptions of where the money is going. I want to get the prospective of someone who has a better understanding of bank lawsuits and settlements then me.
