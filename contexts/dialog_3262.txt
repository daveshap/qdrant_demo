DELIA: <u>You jerks</u>! That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>! You think I want to die like that? Lydia. Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
LYDIA: Any particular kind?
DELIA: Joke! Joke! Aspirin! It doesn't matter what brand.
BARBARA: That little girl saw us.
ADAM: She couldn't have. We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
BARBARA: But she <u>saw</u> us. I could feel it.
ADAM: That's all we need.
CHARLES: Where is your mother?
LYDIA: Stepmother. She's out torturing the movers.
CHARLES: Lydia. Try to be civil. I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
