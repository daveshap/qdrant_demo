SEFTON: What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
COOKIE: I don't know anymore.
SEFTON: I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
COOKIE: In this barracks?
SEFTON: Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
COOKIE: Who is it?
SEFTON: That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
COOKIE: Who is it?
COOKIE: If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
SEFTON: Yeah. Security.
BAGRADIAN: Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
PRICE: Don't worry. He'll be all right.
BAGRADIAN: I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
PRICE: Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
