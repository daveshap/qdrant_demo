what is the best way to get into an apprenticeship post-16?
hi all!

pretty much what the title of the post says. I’m looking to go into an apprenticeship (preferably in the nhs) after my gcse’s but I’m not sure where to start. The nearby college offers them but they didn’t have any for medicine/nursing. From what I understand, you can apply directly with the nhs but I can’t find any information as to how.

if anyone could give me any advice/tips/people to contact etc., I’d really appreciate it!

thank you :)
