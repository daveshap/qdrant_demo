I participated in a suicide prevention walk yesterday and it made me feel more suicidal
I hoped that participating in this walk would give me hope, and help me see how much suicide impacts the lives of the people left behind. Instead, I felt miserable. Everyone was writing messages for people they've lost to suicide and hanging them up for everyone to see. I feel so incredibly screwed up saying this, but as I read the messages, I was envious of the people they wrote about. I was jealous they had the guts to go through with it because I know I don't. This is my first time saying this out loud, because I am so fearful of being judged, but it feels good to get it off my chest.
