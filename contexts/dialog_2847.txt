KENDALL: Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
HARDY: My heart weeps.
OSBORNE: Pike never confessed.
KENDALL: No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.
HARDY: Is it the truth?
KENDALL: There's that word again. As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
OSBORNE: Dunbar says you were.
KENDALL: Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
HARDY: Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
KENDALL: So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
HARDY: Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
KENDALL: No. I said Dunbar.
HARDY: Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said Dunbar was gone
KENDALL: I believe your next line is What are you trying to hide?""
HARDY: Well?
KENDALL: Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
