ADAM: I've got goose-bumps all over me.
TROY: Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife? Isn't that closer?
EVE: Yeah, right! That's where you'd go to find girls! Nome. He's gay, by the way.
ADAM: Good for you.
TROY: Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions. When did Alaska become a state?
ADAM: 1959.
TROY: Who use to own it?
ADAM: Russia.
TROY: When did we get it from them?
ADAM: 1867. Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
TROY: What's the capitol?
ADAM: Juneau.
TROY: Hello! It's Anchorage! Gotcha!
ADAM: Sorry, that's the largest city.
ADAM: Where's he gone?
EVE: He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
ADAM: He has a computer?
EVE: Sure.
ADAM: In the house?
EVE: No. We keep it in the backyard. Of course, in the house. It's in there.
ADAM: May I please be excused?
EVE: Uh...yeah.
ADAM: This must be very new.
TROY: Yeah.
ADAM: It's so small.
TROY: What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
ADAM: I don't think so.
TROY: You don't have a computer in your cabin?
ADAM: No.
TROY: How do you get through those winters? Well, you're right. Juneau. What's the highest peak?
ADAM: Mt. McKinley. It's also the highest point in North America.
TROY: Okay, maybe she is psychic. Let's go eat!
ADAM: That would knock my father out.
TROY: Yeah?
ADAM: Oh, yes. It would probably kill him.
TROY: He's a Windows guy then, huh?
ADAM: Yes. He likes windows.
TROY: Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
ADAM: ...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
TROY: True.
