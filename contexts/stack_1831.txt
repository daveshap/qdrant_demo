What to call spending time on things increasingly less related to, but required for, the main issue? I'm looking for something to call a complicated situation where a task is delayed due to unexpected work on other things required for work on it.A concise thing to say as an answer to \"how's the progress on A\that explains why it wasn't even started, without going on a long, technical-term-peppered rant going something like \"Work on A needs B, which isn't available atm, but we thought we could adapt a C with just a tweak, but C1 keeps giving a resource state error and it turns out C2's hardware doesn't support that(...) so now we're helping Z get their job done faster so they can release Y which X need for W if they are to lend us V which is the only available(...)\"Something like \"getting sidetracked\but with a meaning more like \"searching for a way past the blockade on the main track, and so far only running into more blockades despite reasonable expectations otherwise\".<br>Not losing sight of the goal but failing to approach it, often going even further away in hope of finding a route.
