MIKE: That was so fuckin' money. It was like that Jedi mind" shit."
TRENT: That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
MIKE: I know. I know.
TRENT: They know what you want, believe me. Pretending is just a waste of time. You're gonna take them there eventually anyway. Don't apologize for it.
MIKE: I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
TRENT: Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
WAITRESS: Are you ready to order?
MIKE: Coffee... Two coffees. It says Breakfast Any Time"
WAITRESS: That's right.
MIKE: I'll have pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment"."
WAITRESS: And you?
TRENT: I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
WAITRESS: I'll be back with the coffee.
TRENT: Nice, baby.
MIKE: I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
TRENT: Baby, you did fine.
MIKE: Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."..."
TRENT: ...Baby...
MIKE: ...It's just, I thought Renaissance" was too Excaliber
TRENT: You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
MIKE: I hope so. We gotta go soon.
TRENT: Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
MIKE: We didn't do so bad after all.
TRENT: Baby, we're money.
MIKE: Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
WAITRESS: Hang on, Voltaire.
