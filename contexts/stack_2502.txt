Connect multipart polygon with lines to one label I have several one-part and multipart polygons that I want to label. I Set X and Y values to move the label to a certain position and want to connect the label to the polygon using the following expression in a geometry generator:<blockquote>  make_line(   point_on_surface(  $geometry ),  make_point( \"Label_X\" ,   \"Label_Y\" ))</blockquote>I want the line to connect from the label to every part of a multipart Polygon.Is this possible?
