Vapor pressure of sublimating ice in vacuum I am trying to find a vapor pressure of sublimating ice as a function of thermal energy being absorbed by ice. Basically, I am starting with a sample of ice (t=200K) in a vacuum. From there, I am heating the ice slowly using a heating plate, causing a non-zero vapor pressure of gaseous water to form. Assuming the vacuum will be held (i.e. vapor pressure of water impacts the vacuum negligibly), is it possible to create a relation between the vapor pressure and the thermal power being absorbed by the ice?
