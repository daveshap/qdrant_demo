Interfacing coin cell back up for internal RTC of ESP32 In esp wroom-32 all the VDD pins has a common connection. It includes VDD_RTC too. So in case of power failure if I switch the power between main DC source and coin cell using a mosfet, will it create any interrupt on updating the RTC time?I haven't done any practical on this topic. I got this doubt while going through the internal connection of wroom-32. So please share if there is any proper solution.
