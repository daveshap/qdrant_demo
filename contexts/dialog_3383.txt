CRAIG: Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid Iâ€™m in love with somebody else.
FLORIS: I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
LESTER: Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
CRAIG: I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
LESTER: One hundred and five. Carrot juice. Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
CRAIG: I'll keep that in mind, sir.
LESTER: No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
CRAIG: The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
LESTER: I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
CRAIG: Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
LESTER: All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
