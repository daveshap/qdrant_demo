So I was handcuffed and thrown into the back of a cop car... over a phone call
My friend Damien thought I was going to kill my self. I wasn’t going to act on anything and I never said I was going kill myself just that I was depressed over my divorce and ect.

I’m asleep it’s 11am and I get woken up by 2 hard knocks on the door. Two police officers let themselves in without even explaining why. They stated my friend called and said I was going to kill myself and they then deemed I was a risk. I refused to go with them becuase I didn’t know what the hell was going on.

They handcuffed me, threw me in the back of the car and sent me to a mental ward. I was dehumanized, traumatizes and mentally abused by the staff. I’m not sure if I have any legal rights to purse. I was on emergency detention. So they could withhold me for 72h or longer as deemed by the psychiatrist. But when I saw the psychiatrist, he saw I was fine and I was discharged 24h later. How horrible do you think I felt. :(
