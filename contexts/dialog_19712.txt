NIXON: They did what?! I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
HALDEMAN: Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
NIXON: But O'Brien doesn't even use that office. The Democrats've moved to Miami. There's nothing there!
HALDEMAN: It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
NIXON: Their fourth!
HALDEMAN: It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
NIXON: Contributions! It was a legal contribution. Who the hell authorized this? Colson?
EHRLICHMAN: Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one. It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for. They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
NIXON: Jesus! Did Mitchell know?
EHRLICHMAN: Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
NIXON: Jesus! Through a window?
HALDEMAN: It was her wrist. And it was through a plate-glass door.
EHRLICHMAN: Anyway, they had to take her to Bellevue. Maybe she'll stay this time.
NIXON: Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention. If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary! Was he smoking pot?
EHRLICHMAN: Mitchell?
NIXON: No! Magruder! That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
DEAN: The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect. He turns out to be ex-CIA.
NIXON: Ex-CIA"? There's no such thing as "ex-CIA
EHRLICHMAN: McCord? ...
NIXON: Find out what the hell he was doing at CREEP." This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up."
HALDEMAN: We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
NIXON: That fruitcake! What about him?
HALDEMAN: Well, you know, sir, he's a nut. He used to work here with the Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper. You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen? He wanted to buy a damned fire truck! Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation."
NIXON: What's Liddy got?
HALDEMAN: Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico. The FBI's onto it. We could have a problem with that.
