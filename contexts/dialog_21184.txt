MCKECHNIE: I believe you won decorations during the war.
KILLAINE: Two.
MCKECHNIE: There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor. I'm not one of them.
KILLAINE: Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
MCKECHNIE: You're a young man. You're romantic. You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart. You'll grow out of that.
KILLAINE: Not too far, I hope.
MCKECHNIE: This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk. It is not a thing you can give up as of no value. It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with. It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice. Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
MCKECHNIE: Get out of here!
KILLAINE: What are my orders, sir?
MCKECHNIE: You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl. Go out and prove it against me!
