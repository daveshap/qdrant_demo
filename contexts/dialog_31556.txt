DR. MANHATTAN: The bearer of bad news.
VEIDT: We've lost a colleague. The Comedian is dead.
LAURIE: Blake? Dead?
DR. MANHATTAN: Yes. I heard this morning. Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
VEIDT: Rorschach's on the case. He's got Dreiberg in a lather. He seems to think that someone is stalking" the Watchmen."
