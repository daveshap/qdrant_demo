DUFF: Ain't you goin' to say something?
JOSIE: There's nothing to say.
DUFF: Well, that'll be the first time.
JOSIE: Where're you going to go?
DUFF: When I get set, I'll send for you.
JOSIE: I don't think that'll happen.
DUFF: You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
JOSIE: You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
DUFF: You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
DUFF: Okay.
JOSIE: Duff--
DUFF: Like I said, baby - I'll write you.
