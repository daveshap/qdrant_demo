SKYLAR: Yeah?
WILL: It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
SKYLAR: I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
WILL: Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
SKYLAR: Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
WILL: Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
SKYLAR: Sounds good, where are you now?
WILL: You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
LAMBEAU: Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
WILL: Fuck do you want?
LAMBEAU: I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
WILL: Really?
LAMBEAU: Yes. Under two conditions.
WILL: What're those?
LAMBEAU: That you meet with me twice a week--
WILL: If I agree to this, I walk right now?
LAMBEAU: That's right.
WILL: I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
LAMBEAU: Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will. I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field. I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
BILLY: Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
MORGAN: Suck my cock!
BILLY: Oh, Morgan!
CHUCKIE: What'd you get? You get leniency?
WILL: Probation, counselin', few days a week.
CHUCKIE: You're fuckin' good.
