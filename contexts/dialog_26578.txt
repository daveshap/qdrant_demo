LOW: Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
MACKELWAY: I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
LOW: How's the arm?
MACKELWAY: I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
LOW: He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
MACKELWAY: He's moved on to TV.
LOW: He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses, I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job, even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
MACKELWAY: What was your weakness, sir?
LOW: I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
MACKELWAY: Suspect Zero?
LOW: Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
MACKELWAY: So you went underground?
LOW: Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through. Where's the file?
MACKELWAY: I don't carry it with me.
LOW: You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
MACKELWAY: Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero
LOW: Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
MACKELWAY: The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
