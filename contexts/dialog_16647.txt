NATHAN: And what am I supposed to say to the man?
MONICA: The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
NATHAN: You lost your head.
MONICA: I was just showing emotion.
CAMILLE: So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
LENA: What'd you do?
MONICA: nothing.
CAMILLE: I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
MONICA: I won't. I'm a lesbian.
CAMILLE: That's not funny

MONICA: The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
NATHAN: I know. But chances are...
MONICA: Chances are there's still a chance.
