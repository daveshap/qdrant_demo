I love the feeling you get right before the potential start of a relationship.
The giddy feeling you get when you’re getting to know someone that you feel like could become some kind of romantic relationship is great. Just the feeling of excitement every time you see a notification from them your heart picks up and you just can’t wait to see what they said brings me joy. I know this stuff is really sappy and probably puke worthy but I just really feel like sharing my thoughts on this. 

I’m never sure if it’s going to become anything but it’s a great feeling until it ends. For me, 9 times out of 10 this ends in nothing and I get my hopes up just to have them torn down. I know that’s not the best thing to do to yourself but I just love the start of stuff like this. 

Edit: Put it on the line and asked her to dinner. She said she wasn't interested in me but it's okay. That's the way it goes and we are still friendly toward each other. For anyone else that this has happened to just remember that there are 7.5 billion people on this planet and there is someone out there for you. I am trying to keep that in mind myself.
