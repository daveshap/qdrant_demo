BUDDY: It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
FOLEY: I saw Karen Sisco.
BUDDY: And she saw you?
FOLEY: Yes, she did.
BUDDY: So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
FOLEY: You know how I felt about her.
BUDDY: Did you give her a jump? If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
FOLEY: It wasn't about getting laid. I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
BUDDY: You find out?
FOLEY: Yeah, I did.
BUDDY: So what's that mean? That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
FOLEY: I don't know.
