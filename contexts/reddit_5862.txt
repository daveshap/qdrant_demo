I’m 14 and I wanna become a psychologist?
Hey

As u read in the title thing I’m 14 and I would like to become a psychologist 

I think it’s something to do with me having to deal with a lot of emotional abuse when I was younger and me dealing with the impacts of it

Like social anxiety depression and insomnia ( probably some others also ) but like I want to know why all of this happens I want to know why our brains work the way that they do and yeah I would love to become a psychologist

I was just wondering if it’s a good job to aspire to be or if I should just cut my losses and get realistic with myself 

Thanks for reading please comment :)
