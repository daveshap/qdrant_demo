Breakdown of what I'm paying for in Tuition
I am an out of state grad student. For the most part, I've been using loans/scholarships to pay for school. On my account summary, it has the cost of tuition, non tuition, and misc charges like parking permits, citations, program fees, etc... I am wanting to know what the charge of my tuition entails. For all the non-tuition charges, I know exactly what I am being charged for (parking, school fee, citations, etc...). I would like to know what falls under tuition to make-up that charge.
