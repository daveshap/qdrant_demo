LAUNCELOT: We were in the nick of time. You were in great peril.
GALAHAD: I don't think I was.
LAUNCELOT: You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
GALAHAD: Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
LAUNCELOT: It's too perilous.
GALAHAD: Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
LAUNCELOT: No, no, we must find the Grail.
GALAHAD: Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?
LAUNCELOT: No. It's unhealthy.
GALAHAD: ... I Bet you're gay.
LAUNCELOT: No, I'm not.
