Ex Bestfriend
We had a friend group which was me my ex bsf and two other friends we were pretty close but my ex bsf always said if we created a group chat to not add her cause she was really busy so over this summer i created a group chat but i didn’t add her. It was just me and the other two friends. Everything was going great my ex bsf and me became closer over the summer but that soon came to an end on October she found out we had made a group chat without her so one of my other friends made a group chat including her and everything was fine until a few days later she got all mad and ignored us for 2 weeks and even unfollowed all of us. I decided to confront her about it and she ended up saying that she was mad because we added her to a group chat after we realized that she wasn’t in the other one. It’s been almost three months since that happened we haven’t actually texted since. We’ve invited her to a few events but she never showed up. she said she needs time to think but it has been almost three months should i just move or do i try one more time or should I just wait and see if she ever has an answer? I never really apologized for what I did i know i was in the wrong.
