JACK: Only in a very general way.
ULLMAN: Well...
ULLMAN: ...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur. And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
JACK: Well, that sounds fine to me.
ULLMAN: Physically, it's not a very demanding job. The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
JACK: Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for. I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh...
JACK: five months of peace is just what I want.
ULLMAN: That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
ULLMAN: can of itself be a problem.
JACK: Not for me.
ULLMAN: How about your wife and son? How do you think they'll take to it?
JACK: They'll love it.
ULLMAN: Great...
