I (17M) am on a 3 years old relashionship with my GF (16F), this year I met a girl (15F) in class and I guess I've fallen in love with her, and so does she. I don't know what to do now and I fked up..
I'm sorry for any english mistakes, it is not my native language...

So, I've been on a relashionship with my GF for over 3 years, we're very happy together. We've had some problems in the past but nothing much. 

I never thought something like this could happen, but I'm on my last year of school and there is one Girl on my class...and slowly I started to get closer and closer with her, to a point when she admited that she kinda likes me.

At first I didn't care, but slowly I started to develop feelings towards her...

And for the last 2 weeks, we've been really closed. We started the year always having lunch together, but things started to change since this new year (2020) begun...

We started to get closer, to actually hold hands from time to time, we eventually even started to hug recently...

I know this is wrong...I've got a GF and I'm developing feelings for another girl...but I just can't stop it. My GF also does not have any clue of what's happening between me and the Girl...

I really like this girl. Last week I told her that I love her and she replied back. We spend a lot of time alone.. (we never kissed, just hugs and touches \[hands\])

She always reminds me that I've got a GF and if I want to stay with her (the girl) I would've to make a decision (break up with my GF), but the thing is...it's hard. And I don't even know if thats really what I want. I spend many weekends with my GF, at her house, with her famaly. I don't know if I would have the guts to just end it all, there is just so much history between me and my GF that the thought of just ending it all at once hurts me so much that I have no idea of what to do...

Today I fked up hard, we (me and the Girl) were going to the center of the village by bus (to take each a train to get back home from school), and at the bus stop (where we had to quit), my GF was there (she was going to take the next bus) and well, I just got out of the bus, kissed her and said I had to hurry to my bus, meanwhile the other Girl she was already moving towards her train (I was not surprised by her reaction), once I finally cought with her, she basically told me to not follow her and she hurried to her train (her eyes were also red), I know what I was doing, I fked up hard...

&#x200B;

I sent her a text apologizing, I know it doesnt change a thing but yeah...

&#x200B;

She replied as I'm writting this (40 min after I apologized by text) saying "Don't talk to me right now".

&#x200B;

I never thought I would ever write something about my life on reddit, but here I am asking you for help...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Should I break up with my GF, and start something with the other Girl?

Should I just forget this Girl?

I legit do not know what to do. Any help is welcome

tl,dr

I (17M) started to like another Girl (15F) from my class, considered breaking up with my 3 years old relashionship with my GF (16F) in order to stay with the Girl, but don't know if breaking the last 3 years of life over a "quick crush" is the wisest thing to do. And I'm lost.
