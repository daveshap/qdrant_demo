VICEROY: So, human... you've met your better self!
PICARD: What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
VICEROY: I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
PICARD: That will never happen.
VICEROY: Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
VICEROY: It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
PICARD: There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
VICEROY: I look forward to the sport. Take him.
