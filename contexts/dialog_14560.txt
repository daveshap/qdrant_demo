BRODY: I know what you're going to say.
ELLEN: Do you?
BRODY: In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies. Call the cops. What are we, immune?
ELLEN: It was bad, wasn't it.
BRODY: The goddamn smell is always the same.
ELLEN: Are you going to be able to sleep?
BRODY: Yeah. I think so. Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake!
