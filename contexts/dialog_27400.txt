PORTER: Happened...Yes happened right down there.
MARTINS: You saw it?
PORTER: Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
MARTINS: Why didn't they bring him in the house?
MARTINS: Could he have been conscious?
PORTER: Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
MARTINS: Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
PORTER: Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
MARTINS: I was told that he did not die at once.
PORTER: Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
