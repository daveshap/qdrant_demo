I'm hoping I have a mental illness
I don't want to have one. It just seems that if I have a labeable problem then I know how to act and how others should act around me. Because of this statement I have been researching a lot about mental illnesses. I get a bit depressed at winter brake, and when I'm at school, but sometimes I'm weirdly energetic for no apparent reason. I thought I have bipolar but it all seems as I don't have enough extreme simptoms for it. So that has been bothering me.
