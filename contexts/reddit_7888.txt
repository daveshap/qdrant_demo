When judging whether a PI is a good scientist, which parameter from the google scholar is the most important
Hi. I'm picking Pi for future rotations. I understand that a good PI should be both a good scientist and a good mentor. Since whether a PI is a good scientist is a bit easier to judge than the mentor side,  I started from this direction first. I saw that google scholar has total cited numbers, h-index, and !10 indexes, and the corresponding recent-5-yr version of the three numbers. I assume the recent-5-yr version is a better judgment, but for these three numbers, which one is the most important? If they focus on different aspects of a PI, could someone explain it? Of course, people with all three numbers being very high is the best, but when you are comparing PI in the middle, which factor(s) will play more important roles?  Thanks
