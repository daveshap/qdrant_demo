Not suicidal but not interested in being alive.
I have come out of a long term depression and coping with my life healthily. 

Although, I am still not interested in being alive. FYI, I am not feeling helplessly suicidal but feel tired about being alive. I find life boring and pointless. These thoughts dont even come on purpose, they just are there.

Any help to not have this mindset would be appreciated.
