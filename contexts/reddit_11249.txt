I set my roommate and best friend on fire.
We had a fire in our back yard and I thought it would be cool to pour some gas on it. It flared up and went straight for her, now she has third degree burns on her hand and it singed a lot of her hair pretty bad. I am going to pay for the hospital bill, and a new hair cut.
