FELICIA: Comb my hair out later, honey.
GEORGE: No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
FELICIA: No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
GEORGE: But aren't you...
FELICIA: Right now, I just don't care.
GEORGE: Jill says nothing.
GEORGE: Where's your car?
JILL: A friend dropped me off.
GEORGE: Who?
JILL: Never mind. Where've you been?
GEORGE: A business meeting, I told you that.
JILL: What business meeting?
GEORGE: Look at the way I live.
JILL: I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
GEORGE: What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
JILL: I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
GEORGE: Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
