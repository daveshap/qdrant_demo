MR. CUNNINGHAM: Yes, Cole?
COLE: They used to hang people here.
MR. CUNNINGHAM: That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
COLE: They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
MR. CUNNINGHAM: Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
COLE: They were the ones who hanged everybody.
