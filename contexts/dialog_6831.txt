GRANGE: I've got him if you want him.
LAO: No shooting.
GRANGE: Move in, guys.
LAO: I wish to possess what you have now.
ERIC: I want the girl. Unharmed. Now.
LAO: I know. That is why I will prevail. Mr. Grange... ?
LAO: Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury. And it turned out to be you. At last. I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
ERIC: You're too late. There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to. But he turned to dust and blew away. I don't have any power for you to take.
LAO: I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade. Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow. MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
