What are the potential vulnerabilities of allowing a large http body size? With NGINX and PHP I am allowing 5GB files to be 'uploaded' to my server although they will not be downloaded unless they are 'legitimate' (that is for another question ;)). I was wondering is this is making it easier for DDOS attacks or other attacks or is it as vulnerable as normal seeing as 1 large request is the same if not less intensive than as many small http requests.
