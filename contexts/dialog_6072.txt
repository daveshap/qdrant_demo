KANE: Oh yes, there is.
EMILY: I don't think so. Are you coming, Charles?
KANE: No.
KANE: There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me. And if you think - if any of you think -
EMILY: You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago. You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened. Come on, Charles.
KANE: Go on! Get out! I can fight this thing all alone!
ROGERS: You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane. You're licked. Why don't you -
KANE: Get out! I've got nothing to talk to you about. If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
ROGERS: I see!
SUSAN: Charlie, you're just excited. You don't realize -
KANE: I know exactly what I'm doing. Get out!
EMILY: Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
KANE: Too late for what? Too late for you and this - this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me? Well, you won't do it, I tell you. You won't do it!
