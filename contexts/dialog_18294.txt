MARIAN: I wanted to ask you something. Those motorcycles across the street ...?
PAULA: Uh-huh?
MARIAN: ... What are they all doing there?
PAULA: That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
MARIAN: The motorcycle gang? Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
PAULA: I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village. I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
