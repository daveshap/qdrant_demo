KANE: Do you like poetry, Raymond?
RAYMOND: Can't say, sir.
KANE: Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
RAYMOND: Yes, Mr. Kane.
KANE: Not my wife - not either of them.
RAYMOND: Oh, yes, sir.
KANE: Do you know what that is?
RAYMOND: It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
KANE: Persia. It belonged to a king.
RAYMOND: How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
KANE: He was dead... That's a poem. Do you know what it means?
RAYMOND: No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
KANE: I didn't used to be afraid of it.
