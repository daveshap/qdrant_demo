CHILI: How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
KAREN: I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
CHILI: You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
KAREN: He must mean after Slime Creature 3"."
CHILI: That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
KAREN: Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
CHILI: Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
KAREN: Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
CHILI: Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
KAREN: Don't go out of your way.
CHILI: Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
KAREN: Right. See how your story ends.
CHILI: Yeah. Right. Listen, Touch of Evil"'s playing near my hotel. You wanna go check it out? Watch Charlton Heston play a Mexican?"
