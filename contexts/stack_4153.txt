Flight operator says sold out, codeshare says not sold out I'm looking to book a trans-Atlantic flight. My options are basically United and Lufthansa; each operates some flights, and each sells tickets on the other's flights. For one leg operated by United, Lufthansa has a premium economy ticket available on their site, but only if I book as a round-trip (if I try multi-city it says premium economy is sold out). United, on the other hand, says the premium economy is sold out on their site, and as the operator I assume they'd have the most up-to-date info. Is this just a website glitch, or is it possible that the premium fare is in fact still available?
