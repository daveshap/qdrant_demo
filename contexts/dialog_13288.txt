NORVILLE: ...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
AMY: Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
NORVILLE: The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
AMY: -- or lack thereof?
NORVILLE: -- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.
AMY: Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
NORVILLE: ...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
AMY: I'm sure I --
NORVILLE: Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
AMY: Well, I --
NORVILLE: Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
