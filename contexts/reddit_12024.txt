just had to cut lose my group of friends.
nothing too serious, but my group of friends have always been different to me. small bits in common but whatever. i live in a small town and people who are tolerable are slim picking. i've had a group of friends for 5 years now and most of that i've been at uni. they never do anything for anyone else and tonight i wanted to go out, asked everyone and nothing. check instagram while with my best mate (for 20 years) and a photo of all them with #bestfriends . that's the last straw. problem is as a 22 year old who is already done with this town but stuck here for another year or so it's hard. i guess i just wanted to vent and hey, any internet friends would be cool haha
