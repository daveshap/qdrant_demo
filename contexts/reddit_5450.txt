Audio mixer/engineer for 20 years, transferable skills to other careers?
I’ve worked in the live concert industry for my entire career, and obviously with the pandemic any job involving large gatherings of people could be nonexistent for a long time. Currently furloughed from my full time mixing job with no guarantee of bringing me back. 

I’m wondering what other fields I could get into with my particular skill set. I’m comfortable with the digital tech that surrounds the audio world these days- computers, RF, networking, etc. But also I’m used to super tight deadlines, high stress situations, and leading crews of people. 

I’m a quick learner, but I’m concerned that I’m not an expert in any of these things other than mixing large rock shows- and I don’t know how employers would view that. 

Any thoughts about this or advice is greatly appreciated.
