MR. HENRY: Every once in a while some cat comes to me. He wants to know how I made it. How did I become a success? The first thing I tell them is: follow your instincts. Let your instincts guide you. The second thing I tell them is, for Christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
ANTHONY: Grammar.
DIGNAN: What do you mean grammar?
MR. HENRY: The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
ANTHONY: You mean like techniques?
MR. HENRY: Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
