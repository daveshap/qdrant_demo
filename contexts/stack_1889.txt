Wrong usage of number In the textbook I read the following sentence: \"A monopolist who can fix the price or output (but not both) may want to find out the response of the demand for a product to changes in price.\" Are not these two words response and changes misaligned in the number?According to my understanding of the English sentence structure  it either should be responses or change in price. The reasons why I think they are misaligned is that it creates ambiguity. For example, imagine that monopolist changes price twice. Once it increases by one dollar and another time decreases by 2 dollars. Is monopolist interested in the overall response of the demand (total change in quantity demanded) after the second change in the price or is monopolist interested in the response of the demand for each particular change in the price? Which one do u think is meant by this sentence? Or equivalently to which case is it associated for native English speaker?
