60 credit hours?
Hi!
I (finally) got switched over to a MFT program, and it says that I need 60 credit hours due to living in PA. How many years will this take to complete?

About my program:
Marriage and family specialization in LGBTQ couple and family therapy 
Tuition/ 2,700 per course and 54,000 for all 
Northcentral University 

I look forward to this subreddit! :)

PS: my courses are 12 weeks a piece
