Your Experience with a Double Major or Double Degree?
Hello, I was wondering if anyone here has double majored or pursued two degrees at the same time while in Graduate school?

I'll be honest and let you know that even after researching the difference between double majors vs. double degrees I'm still not 100% sure on how it works.

I'm going for my Master's in Healthcare Administration (MHA) and Master's in Healthcare Informatics (MHI) and was wondering if anyone has done or is currently doing something similar to this? 

What was your majors/degrees? What was your experience? Did you complete both majors/degrees? How difficult was it?
