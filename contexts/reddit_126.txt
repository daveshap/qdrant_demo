I am a..
First generation citizen, child of Mexican immigrants, college bound senior in high school that has been accepted to her dream college (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo) that has no idea how to pay for the amount of money that financial aid will not cover. Loans are not an option, at least not 11,000 in loans. 
I was just wondering if there was anybody out there that could point me in the right direction, or anybody that could let me know of any scholarships that I could apply for because I would really like to change the direction my family's children have gone in.
This may or may not be in the right category but I'm new to reddit. 
Any help though?
It'd be much appreciated.
Even any helpful tips are welcome!
Thank you!
