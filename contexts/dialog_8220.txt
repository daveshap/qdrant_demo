BRILL: You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
DEAN: No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert.
DEAN: We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
BRILL: How fast can you learn?
DEAN: Pretty fast.
BRILL: We'll have to re-stock some basics.
