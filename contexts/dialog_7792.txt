JESSICA: Wipe your feet. My parents are totally anal.
HARRY: Ooh gross.
JESSICA: Would you like something to drink?
HARRY: Yeah, but I'm buying.
JESSICA: Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
HARRY: Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? You had questions?
JESSICA: I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
HARRY: That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
JESSICA: LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
HARRY: She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
JESSICA: Sit down, I have something to tell you.
HARRY: I'm fine.
JESSICA: Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
