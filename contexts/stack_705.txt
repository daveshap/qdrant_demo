Are windows and ubuntu wireless firmware the same? I have a dualboot Windows 8.1 and Kubuntu 17.10 with Intel Wireless 7260 - Rev 6b.My internet is very unstable and unreliable, and after researching the problem i suspect it's the firmware. Installing firmware through Ubuntu seems a little complex and open to me messing things up.So if I installed the firmware through windows, would this mean that I wouldn't need to install it for Ubuntu?Any help would be appreciated, thanks!
