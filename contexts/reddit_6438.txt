New job is possibly incredibly toxic
Hey everyone,

I just started at my new job on monday. I was never told what the work would ensue, other than the fact that it's office work, m-f 9-5 with some insane benefits. Seems too good to be true, especially because they're hiring during this pandemic.

This job already rubs me the wrong way, and today was my first day of work after training. The work itself is simple, however it seems mistakes still can be costly.

I was the only one to wear a mask on every day in the office this week. Heck, the only one to wear a mask any day of the week.

There are two breaks, and while lunch is provided, you have to work while you eat. On each 15 minute break, you must also move your car, as the business has no parking.

Management has been cold, distant, and accusatory.

Am I imagining all of this, or is this actually an incredibly toxic work enviornment?
