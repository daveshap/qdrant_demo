MOTHER: How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
DADDY: Well, I have a pretty good idea.
MOTHER: If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
DADDY: They follow her because she's a -- -- no, I won't say that.
MOTHER: What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
DADDY: Darlin', Rose has got to go!
MOTHER: I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
DOLL: What's happening?
BUDDY: Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
DOLL: Buddy... does Rose really... do it" with all those boys and men?"
BUDDY: Doll, don't ask childish questions.
WASKI: Of course not!
BUDDY: Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
MOTHER: Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
ROSE: What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
