HAN: Easy, your worship. Only trying to help.
LEIA: Would you please stop calling me that?
HAN: Sure. I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
LEIA: Yes, you do.
HAN: You could be a touch warmer, though. Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
LEIA: Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
HAN: That's quite a compliment.
LEIA: Stop that.
HAN: Why?
