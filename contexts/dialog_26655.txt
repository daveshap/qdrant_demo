SIDNEY: Jimmy! This is a coincidence. I am just going -
WELDON: Yeah. A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week! This is my press agent, Joan.

WELDON: What do you do for that hundred a week. Fall out of bed?
SIDNEY: Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker. I can promise you -
WELDON: Joan, call a cop! We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
SIDNEY: Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
WELDON: That was two months ago. Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
