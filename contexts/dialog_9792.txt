FLETCH: Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
MARVIN: Velma.
FLETCH: Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
MARVIN: Check.
FLETCH: Okay. Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
MARVIN: Oh, about ten days ago.
FLETCH: Ten days ago?
MARVIN: That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
FLETCH: Isn't that nice. Since when?
MARVIN: Since he moved to L.A.
FLETCH: Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
MARVIN: What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
FLETCH: Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
MARVIN: Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
VELMA: Cute young thing, too.
FLETCH: I'm sorry?
VELMA: His bride. Cute as a button.
FLETCH: You've met her?
