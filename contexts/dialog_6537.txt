SAKS: Hello. I am Meryhew Saks. The song is called Murder By Numbers." The performers are a group called The Police. Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note. This is an extremely complex case
M.J.: Over here.
SAKS: We don't see too many lady homicide detectives. You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
M.J.: Someone broke into her place last night. It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
SAKS: I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
M.J.: Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
SAKS: We know Helen. She's not exactly a credible collaborator. Especially late in the day...
M.J.: She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
SAKS: Who prescribes the brandy?
M.J.: How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
SAKS: She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for. Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
M.J.: Okay.
SAKS: We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone. I know you won't mention it.
