LUDLOW: So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
MALCOLM: Do me a favor. Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth. You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
LUDLOW: You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw. You violated that agreement.
MALCOLM: You cost me my livelihood. That on which I relied to support my children.

LUDLOW: You version of it.
MALCOLM: There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.

LUDLOW: InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests. People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
