I'm not strictly aligned with either U.S. political party. Why can't the Republicans put forth a candidate in recent years that appeals to voters like me?
It seems there is something about the nature of Republican primaries and the party stances themselves that lend the Republican party in recent years to not put forth candidates which appeal to neutral voters like me.

To keep perspective, we just had a two-term Republican president leave office eight years ago—so it's not like Republican wins are rare unicorns in the 21st century. But the GOP's results in the three presidential elections since then are not good. In 2008, the election was marred from a centrist's perspective by [Sarah Palin's nomination for VP](http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/2008/11/five-reasons-th.html/), combined with [stronger unity within the Democratic party](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/us/politics/08dems.html?_r=0). In 2012, Romney and Ryan ran a [bizzarely poor campaign](https://shadowproof.com/2012/11/08/mitt-romneys-ten-biggest-mistakes/). In 2016, we have only seen the Primaries drama and Trump so far, so centrist voters are naturally alienated—but there is no guarantee the Republican nominee will swing far enough back to the center to entice moderate voters this election.

Politically, I am divided almost 50-50 between Democratic platform and Republican platform. I vote more based on foreign policy than domestic policy matters. I would be happy to consider a viable Republican challenger to Hillary Clinton, if one appears. But the Republican Party still has been unable to produce an appealing candidate in recent years.

**Is there a concrete reason why this is? Perhaps it's just a case of bad luck in wooing swing votes? Or maybe the answer is simple, and I'm just not a representative centrist voter?** Thank you for your thoughts.
