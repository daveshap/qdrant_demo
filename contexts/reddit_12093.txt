Cheated on my girlfriend, can't take what I deserve.
My girlfriend found out that, in a moment of drunken weakness, I kissed another girl who I'd been texting for a while out of boredom. It was over in less than five seconds, I hated myself as soon as it happened, and I cut off all ties with the girl immediately after. I can't deal with the thought of losing her over this, or explaining to my son why he'll never see her again. Not looking for sympathy because I know I don't deserve any. I just don't understand why she doesn't see that I still love her, and always have, even though I made this stupid, shitty mistake. Is there any way for me to prove to the love of my life that I can change? Or should I just accept my punishment?

EDIT: My little boy isn't...her little boy. They're just really close, as young as he is.
