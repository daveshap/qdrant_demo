My depression has been beating a retreat for the past 22 days, but I fear she's resting and gaining strength to try to take me back down. She better be ready, I'm fighting.
After 2 years for severe depression, and denial of said depression, I decided to try to use all the tools I've gained from therapy and pop psych.

Part of me is getting worried since I've been relatively okay since 2019 started.  Bit of sadness, self hate and regret crept in.  Thinking of ways I could've been a better daughter to my dying mother, and sister to my dying brother, and friend to my dying ex-boyfriend and more attentive to my dying father...I was able to force myself out of that doom and remember all I did do.  I forced myself to remember what friends, family, co-workers, and other people said about my devotion and love.

My depression is such a playful, cruel and smart bitch.  It's fucking exhausting to battle that cunning cuntface.

Just want to encourage everyone here to keep up the fight.  Be in your own corner.  

Take care all.
