RIDDICK: Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
FRY: You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
FRY: I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
RIDDICK: Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
FRY: What, you're afraid?
RIDDICK: Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
FRY: <u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
RIDDICK: Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
