JACK: Safety on?
TWOMBLEY: Yeah.
JACK: This way.
TWOMBLEY: Sun's gettin high.
JACK: Deers have ears too.
LARIVIERE: Told you the snow was coming down. Take the grader.
WADE: Where's the plow?
LARIVIERE: Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
WADE: His son-in-law damn near killed me.
LARIVIERE: Huh?
WADE: At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
LARIVIERE: Don't go playing policeman.
WADE: What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
LARIVIERE: You don't want the extra police pay?
WADE: I'm not saying that.
LARIVIERE: Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
WADE: Fuck you.
LARIVIERE: That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
