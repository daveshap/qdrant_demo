My parents judge and make fun of me because I'm a "prude"
I'm a 19 year old girl. I've never had a boyfriend, though not by choice, and I'm a virgin. I don't drink often because I get sick after two beers and it's not worth it to me. I don't smoke pot because I don't like the smell and I don't like the way some people act when high. For some reason, my parents want me to change these lifestyle choices and make fun of me for them. 

I guess I should start off by saying both my parents like to party. They drink on a daily basis, though they don't always get drunk, and they both smoke pot. They have been bothering me about this for a while, but tonight at a New Year's Eve party it really just pushed me over the edge.

First my mom and her friend, who were drunk, started asking be inappropriate sexual questions in front of other people, mostly men and one of them being my father. They told me that if I don't drink I should at least get high. They were also telling me that if I don't lose my virginity by the time I'm 21 then I'm a loser. Then they started asking me if I would at least do oral sex, and if I know how to orgasm, etc etc. I finally got too embarrassed and left. 

I went home next door and overheard my father talking shit about me. We're planning a trip to Vegas, and he was saying that I need to stay home because I'll drag everyone else down because I'm a stick in the mud. 

There's been more instances like this but this one just happened so that's why I'm sharing it. I guess I just don't understand why they're so judgmental. While I am a little boring, I feel like the choices I'm making are generally positive and something normal parents would be proud of. I plan on talking to them about it tomorrow but I don't really know what to say :/ Anyways, thanks for listening/reading.
