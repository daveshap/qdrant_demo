Writing advice for my WWI paper
Right, so I'm writing a 15-page essay on tanks in WWI for my HIST 551 class. The topic is as follows: *How did the use of tanks adapt and change between the battles of the Somme, Cambrai, and Villers-Brettoneaux*?

So, I've got plenty of sources for each of these (courtesy of [archive.org](https://archive.org) and their massive collection of digitized books in these weird times). The issue is the writing. I've only ever written essays on larger things like the relationship of Morocco and England during queen Elizabeth I's rule and stuff like that. Plus, I've never written about tactical stuff or battles in general. What is your advice?
