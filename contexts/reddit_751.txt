How to change fit in at high school
I’m on mobile sorry for format.
Anyways I have a very hard time fitting in with people. Also I seem to “float” around different groups. My brother on the other hand knows everyone is is well liked, but it feels like people treat me like an outcast and act like they hate me. I try to fit in and act different but it’s getting to the point it’s hard to cope with being alone. any advice is welcomed
