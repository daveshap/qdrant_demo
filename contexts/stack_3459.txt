What to do after rejecting an invalid CSRF token? I'm implementing CSRF protection (using Symfony's CSRF library), and I'm wondering what response to send to clients upon receiving an invalid token.Currently we have a session that lasts 30 days, and we'd like the CSRF token to expire after 12 hours (I'm keeping track of the expire time in the backend, not a cookie). So there is a possibility that a user may leave a page open all day and try to submit a form.I've seen this happen with JIRA when I return to my computer a day after leaving a page open, as their session is long lasting as well, but the CSRF token only lasts a day or so. My plan right now is similar to that flow \u2014 to send a 403 error, and then a new token will be sent on the next GET request (assuming their session is still valid).Also, what is the recommendation for data the user filled out in HTML forms? Should I keep track of it and repopulate the form with data they already entered when they finally get back to that page?
