PILAR: We thought we were something, didn't we?
SAM: Yeah.
PILAR: I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
SAM: Yeah.
PILAR: I mean what did we know about anything?
SAM: Nothing.
PILAR: When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
SAM: You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
PILAR: Yeah?
SAM: I came back 'cause you were here.
