GOBLE: I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
MAGRUDER: The joint's not open, Mac. Who's Brandon?
GOBLE: I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
MAGRUDER: Go live in a tent.
GOBLE: It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
MAGRUDER: Talk English. How do I know you're you?
MAGRUDER: Mr. Brandon couldn't be here. He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
GOBLE: One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed. Not too fat- not too thin.
MAGRUDER: What do I get for it?
GOBLE: You get it's brother.
MAGRUDER: Sounds like a fair swap. Let's take a look.
MAGRUDER: I need a receipt. Sign your name across the flap.
GOBLE: Open it and count it.
MAGRUDER: When you sign for it, you count it. It's your dough.
