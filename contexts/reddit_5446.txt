How do I get started as a Entry Level Social Media Coordinator , what are the steps I need to take ?
I have been interested in Social Media Marketing, Advertising and Marketing as it combines my creative mind with something useful that I can make a living out from. Sadly I am 21 years old and I have no support from my parents and living paycheck to paycheck and probably won't go back to college which is fine. But what other options do I have in Social Media Marketing to get a entry level job without a degree. Right now I'm working as a Restaurant Photographer but am saving up for my first camera so that can help me out with being in the Advertisement and Marketing industry. But what else can I do . And how can I get any sort of education or training without a degree?
