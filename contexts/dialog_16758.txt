HORNY GUY: I -- I -- I... Don't...
BOBBY: I don't get it.
JESS: I never promised you anything.
BOBBY: How could you let her see this?
JESS: Goodbye, Bobby.
BOBBY: Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
JESS: Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
BOBBY: Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
JESS: Take her.
BOBBY: What'd you say?
JESS: I want you to take her with you.
