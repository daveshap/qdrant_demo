What would be in the Kernel of a Dequantization Map? Consider forming a symplectic map between all the Hamiltonians on Hilbert Space and all the Hamiltonians on Phase Space. (I understand that taking the Converse of the Groenewold Van-Hove Theorem this is somewhat non-sensical but bear with me)What would be in the Kernel of such a map ?Can you even form a homomorphism between the operators in hilbert space and those in phase space ?
