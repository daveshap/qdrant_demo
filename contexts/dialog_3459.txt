EDWARD: I have to leave. Tonight.
BEAMEN: Why?
EDWARD: This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
BEAMEN: No one's ever left.
JENNY: How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
EDWARD: I suspect it will hurt a lot.
BEAMEN: You won't find a better place!
EDWARD: I don't expect to.
JENNY: Promise me you'll come back.
EDWARD: I promise. Someday. When I'm really supposed to.
