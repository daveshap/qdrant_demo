How do you find time to learn?
This is a super simple question. How can busy parents incorporate learning (reading work related books, articles) to further develop their career. I have no idea how to weave learning into my full time job, new baby, house chores. I read audible but I am always half distracted by simultaneously folding laundry or cooking. Itâ€™s hard! Any tips?
