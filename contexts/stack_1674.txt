Should I spread the pads out on the footprint of a THT LED? I have a 4 pin RGB LED with a common anode.  I'm trying to make my first PCB and I am creating the footprint for the LED now.I don't have a datasheet for the LEDs unfortunately.I have a ruler DigiKey sent me and it seems like the pins fit snugly in the 0.6mm hole.  I think the space between the pins is roughly the same as the pin width.I think that gives me a pitch of 1.2mm.  I was considering a 1.0mm pad with a 0.6mm hole.  That'd give me only 0.4mm around the pin for soldering and paltry 0.2mm between the pads.  This seems like a lot of extra work for the small benefit of being able to settle the LED all the way down on the board and solder the pins on the back of the holes.Another option I considered is spreading the pads out using roughly the entire 10mm of space under the LED.  With a 0.1mil pitch, the LED would stick out further from the board but soldering would be somewhat easier because I could have larger annular rings.Should I spread the pads out on my THT LED and how do you go about making decisions like that?
