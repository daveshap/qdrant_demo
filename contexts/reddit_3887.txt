Some positive changes in online dating?
I wonder if everyone is becoming exhausted with the culture of online dating because after weeks of matches behaving badly (ghosting, nice-guying, one word responses), I got a string of absolutely wonderful guys. None of them worked out but I wanted to shout out the good guys that DO exist on dating apps.

One sent a message explaining why he matched with me (attractive), why he never messaged (only in town for the weekend), and why he was unmatching (lives on other side of country and doesn't want to waste my time, distance on app verified this). 

After chatting with a second guy, he told me something I said was a dealbreaker to him and he was going to unmatch me BUT that I was pretty and wished for me to find a good guy. "I know dating is rough, but there's someone out there for you".

After a date, for the FIRST TIME EVER a guy texted me to explain why we wouldn't work, saying that he wanted kids really soon, but wished me the best of luck. Usually I just get ghosted.

Maybe it's a fluke, but seeing good, sincere, and mature people on these apps give me hope.
