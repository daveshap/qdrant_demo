NARCISSUS: But they're not destroyed, not yet.
COMMODUS: Do we really need to repair this fort? It seems like an expensive undertaking. I propose we burn it to the ground. That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
MARCUS AURELIUS: Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
NARCISSUS: The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
MARCUS AURELIUS: Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome! You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
